Canonical form based, justification:
chunk is not a good base: 
Hermionne and Ron -> more than one author
"the mysterious harry potter" -> chunk contained word not directly related to the name of a character

Proper names are not good base:
Hermionne and Ron -> one head word but the chunk is related to 2 authors
Harry Potter - James Potter -> share one proper name but different character
Professor Dumbledore, Mr Dumbledore -> share one proper name and are same character





Canonical names -> related to chunk

Proper names, one word, could be canonical

One word and not proper -> we don't want it





still ambiguous,
the Dursleys =? Dudley Dursley
the great wizard =? DUmbledore
Professor McGonagall ==? Minerva(first name mentionned only one time among the first book of the serie)



Title rmeoving:
harry is a verb and a noun -> difficult to filter noun from proper nouns
some proper noun are invented and non repertoried -> difficult to select "True" proper names
