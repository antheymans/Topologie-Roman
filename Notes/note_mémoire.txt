first-order co-occurrence
cooccurrence
(sometimes called syntagmatic association) if they are typically nearby each other.
Thus wrote is a first-order associate of book or poem. Two words have second-order

SentiWordNet via python 3 NLTK

NLTK python 2-3 but 3 strongly recommanded

Stanford's library CoreNLP java but could interact, easyer with python 3.6.8 ->  stanfordcorenlp 

Networkx 2.2 python 2-3 python 2.3 -> python 3


As pattern should be replaced in either way, migration to python 3.
More librarie could potentially not being anymore in state of the art ! Check that.
Unicode easyer in python3 !




REQUIREMENT 

python2
pattern " conda install -c asmeurer pattern "
matplotlib "conda install matplotlib"
networkx "conda install networkx"
conda install networkx=1.11
