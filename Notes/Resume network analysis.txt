Social network:
Self-organizing: Global structure appears
Emergent: Pattern supposed to emerge from interaction
Complex: Diverse, Multiple element, adapted to environnement
+-Self Organizing: Node add themselve to network and modify topology
Small world: type of network in which most nodes are not connected, but the shortest distance between two nodes is small (formally, means proportional to the logarithm of # nodes). 
		Hifh clustering compare to random with equal average degree
		low average shortest path
		Random graph are small-world, scale-free graph are super-small world
Scale-free network:
	Notion of preferential attachementgrg
		-> Existence of hub, particular distribution of degree: decreasing line different from random graph wich have a non-asymptotic maximum.
		-> "super small world" shortest path in Log Log N.
		


But here in a book, 
	- character are imagined by the author to be part of the book. Not self organizing.
	 (difficult to speak about time because the author could invent its book in a non linear way.µ

	- Only few agent act at a time.


Other classidication:
	(un)directed




Coefficient, measure: 



Clustering:
	Global clustering coefficient:
	In graph theory, a clustering coefficient is a measure of the degree to which nodes in a graph tend to cluster together.
	C = # closed triplets / # all triplets = 3 x # triangle / # all triplets

	Local clustering coefficient:
	Local measure
	Number of triangle related / measure depending of the vextex degree

	Network average clustering coefficient: (average clustering coefficient Watts and Strogatz)
	Different from global clustering coefficient, gives more weight to low degree node.
	Each vertex contributing to the coefficient has its contribution weighted by k_i (k_i -1) compared to global coefficient.
