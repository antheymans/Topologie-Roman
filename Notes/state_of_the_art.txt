alias resolution and charachter identification:
    1.Run StanfordNLP to find coreferent mentions
    2.Identify the mention chains that correspond to characters or groups of characters
    3.Replace the original text
    4.Post process to address clumps of characters and first person words (e.g. “I”)

    ->  -marking all chains that are animate (a character that behaves or has the actions of a living being) asa character
        -dentifying all chains that are coreferent with pronouns that refer to humans (e.g. “he”).
    ->  In step three, we replace the mentions in all marked chains with a number. This number wil l be the same across all mentions for a specific chain
    ->  In step four, we have a post­processing step that collects and identifies ambiguous chains.
    
-> use corenlp, could be more performant
-> use novels or fairy tales, les computattionnal cost
-> Sex disanbiguation using pronouns from coresolution

They obtain result that we can compare and use their metrics ! If we find supervised data

Extracting Social Networks from Literary Fiction 2010 state of the art
"Some theorists have suggested a relationship be-tween the size of a community and the amount ofdialogue that occurs, 
positing that “face to facetime” diminishes as the number of characters inthe novel grows. 
Others suggest that as the socialsetting becomes more urbanized, the quality of di-alogue also changes, 
with more interactions occur-ring in rural communities than urban communities"

"the density of the network providesevidence about the cohesion of a large or smallcommunity, 
and cliques may indicate a social frag-mentation"
-coreferent generation -> cluster of mention
- quoted speech

conclusion :
   ASSUMPTION hat there is an inverse correlation betweenthe amount of dialogue in a novel and thenumber of characters in that novel. FALSE
    Geographical, urban area vs country
   FORM is better predicter that setting for novels.

-> "we filtered outthe entities that are mentioned fewer than three"
-> generate variation of catched nous, good idea ! to find dursley from Mr Dursley

The Stanford CoreNLP Natural Language Processing Toolkit
Seems better than pattern because its
	-use coref tools
	-use gender assignation tools based on coref
	-only in java, not compatible with our program

Methods for Precise Named Entity Matching in Digital Collections

toolkit that generate possible alias of a name, initially for architecture project
-takes a name as input
-remove sequentially modifiers
-add deteminers "the", for people we could add here some title as "Professor","Mr","Mrs"

Structure-based Clustering of Novels 2014
-location name count number of people/location count
-firstname, honorifics, surname diferentiation
-gender based clustering of names due to honorifics, sliding windows(non feasible here)-> could add a gender name dictionnary
-good overview of different technique of network construction and analysis
