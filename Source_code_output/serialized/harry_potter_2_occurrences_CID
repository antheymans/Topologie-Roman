The four school Houses are named after them : Godric Gryffindor , Helga Hufflepuff , Rowena Ravenclaw , and Salazar Slytherin . They built this castle together , far from prying Muggle eyes , for it was an age when magic was feared by common people , and witches and wizards suffered much persecution . "

But then disagreements sprang up between them . A rift began to grow between Slytherin and the others . Slytherin wished to be more selective about the students admitted to Hogwarts . He believed that magical learning should be kept within all-magic families . He disliked taking students of Muggle parentage , believing them to be untrustworthy . After a while , there was a serious argument on the subject between Slytherin and Gryffindor , and Slytherin left the school . "

VMr. Lucius Malfoy , a governor of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry , where the enchanted car crashed earlier this year , called today for Mr. Weasley 's resignation . " Weasley has brought the Ministry into disrepute , " Mr. Malfoy told our reporter . " He is clearly unfit to draw up our laws and his ridiculous Muggle Protection Act should be scrapped immediately . "

Of course , it was fifty years ago , so it was before his time , but he knows all about it , and he says that it was all kept quiet and it 'll look suspicious if I know too much about it .

In my fifth year , the Chamber was opened and the monster attacked several students , finally killing one . I caught the person who'd opened the Chamber and he was expelled . But the Headmaster , Professor Dippet , ashamed that such a thing had happened at Hogwarts , forbade me to tell the truth . A story was given out that the girl had died in a freak accident . They gave me a nice , shiny , engraved trophy for my trouble and warned me to keep my mouth shut . But I knew it could happen again . The monster lived on , and the one who had the power to release it was not imprisoned . "

People say Muggle Studies is a soft option , but I personally think wizards should have a thorough understanding of the non-magical community , particularly if they 're thinking of working in close contact with them - look at my father , he has to deal with Muggle business all the time . My brother Charlie was always more of an outdoor type , so he went for Care of Magical Creatures . Play to your strengths , Harry . "

This snake , which may reach gigantic size and live many hundreds of years , is born from a chicken 's egg , hatched beneath a toad . Its methods of killing are most wondrous , for aside from its deadly and venomous fangs , the Basilisk has a murderous stare , and all who are fixed with the beam of its eye shall suffer instant death . Spiders flee before the Basilisk , for it is their mortal enemy , and the Basilisk flees only from the crowing of the rooster , which is fatal to it . "

On the one hand , Tom Riddle , poor but brilliant , parentless but so brave , school prefect , model student ... on the other hand , big , blundering Hagrid , in trouble every other week , trying to raise werewolf cubs under his bed , sneaking off to the Forbidden Forest to wrestle trolls ... but I admit , even I was surprised how well the plan worked . I thought someone must realize that Hagrid could n't possibly be the Heir of Slytherin . It had taken me five whole years to find out everything I could about the Chamber of Secrets and discover the secret entrance ... as though Hagrid had the brains , or the power !

What if you found out how to work it , and I repeated all her secrets to you ? What if , even worse , I told you who'd been strangling roosters ? So the foolish little brat waited until your dormitory was deserted and stole it back . But I knew what I must do . It was clear to me that you were on the trail of Slytherin 's heir . From everything Ginny had told me about you , I knew you would go to any lengths to solve the mystery - particularly if one of your best friends was attacked . And Ginny had told me the whole school was buzzing because you could speak Parseltongue ...
