VHarry 's dead parents , who had been a witch and wizard themselves , were never mentioned under the Dursleys " roof . For years , Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon had hoped that if they kept Harry as downtrodden as possible , they would be able to squash the magic out of him . To their fury , they had been unsuccessful , and now lived in terror of anyone finding out that Harry had spent most of the last two years at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry . The most the Dursleys could do these days was to lock away Harry 's spellbooks , wand , cauldron and broomstick at the start of the summer holidays , and forbid him to talk to the neighbours .

Dementors are not to be fooled by tricks or disguises - or even Invisibility Cloaks , " he added blandly , and Harry and Ron glanced at each other .

I look to the Prefects , and our new Head Boy and Girl , to make sure that no student runs foul of the Dementors . "

Even Muggles feel their presence , though they ca n't see them . Get too near a Dementor and every good feeling , every happy memory , will be sucked out of you . If it can , the Dementor will feed on you long enough to reduce you to something like itself - soulless and evil . You 'll be left with nothing but the worst experiences of your life .

VFudge dropped his voice and proceeded in a sort of low rumble . " Not many people are aware that the Potters knew You-Know-Who was after them . Dumbledore , who was of course working tirelessly against You-Know-Who , had a number of useful spies . One of them tipped him off , and he alerted James and Lily at once . He advised them to go into hiding . Well , of course , You-Know-Who was n't an easy person to hide from . Dumbledore told them that their best chance was the Fidelius Charm . "

The information is hidden inside the chosen person , or Secret-Keeper , and is henceforth impossible to find - unless , of course , the Secret-Keeper chooses to divulge it . As long as the Secret-Keeper refused to speak , You-Know-Who could search the village where Lily and James were staying for years and never find them , not even if he had his nose pressed against their sitting-room window !

The murder of Pettigrew and all those Muggles was the action of a cornered and desperate man - cruel ... pointless . Yet I met Black on my last inspection of Azkaban . You know , most of the prisoners in there sit muttering to themselves in the dark , there 's no sense in them ... but I was shocked at how normal Black seemed . He spoke quite rationally to me . It was unnerving . You'd have thought he was merely bored - asked if I'd finished with my newspaper , cool as you please , said he missed doing the crossword . Yes , I was astounded at how little effect the Dementors seemed to be having on him - and he was one of the most heavily guarded in the place , you know . Dementors outside his door , day and night .

VRon was enraged that Hermione had never taken Crookshanks 's attempts to eat Scabbers seriously , had n't bothered to keep a close enough watch on him and was still trying to pretend that Crookshanks was innocent by suggesting Ron look for Scabbers under all the boys " beds . Hermione , meanwhile , maintained fiercely that Ron had no proof that Crookshanks had eaten Scabbers , that the ginger hairs might have been there since Christmas , and that Ron had been prejudiced against her cat ever since Crookshanks had landed on Ron 's head in the Magical Menagerie .

V" My transformations in those days were - were terrible . It is very painful to turn into a werewolf . I was separated from humans to bite , so I bit and scratched myself instead . The villagers heard the noise and the screaming and thought they were hearing particularly violent spirits . Dumbledore encouraged the rumour ... even now , when the house has been silent for years , the villagers don"t dare approach it ...

V" Yes , indeed , " said Lupin . " It took them the best part of three years to work out how to do it . Your father and Sirius here were the cleverest students in the school , and lucky they were , because the Animagus transformation can go horribly wrong - one reason the Ministry keeps a close watch on those attempting to do it . Peter needed all the help he could get from James and Sirius . Finally , in our fifth year , they managed it . They could each turn into a different animal at will . "

V" They could n't keep me company as humans , so they kept me company as animals , " said Lupin . " A werewolf is only a danger to people . They sneaked out of the castle every month under James 's Invisibility Cloak . They transformed ... Peter , as the smallest , could slip beneath the Willow 's attacking branches and touch the knot that freezes it . They would then slip down the tunnel and join me . Under their influence , I became less dangerous . My body was still wolfish , but my mind seemed to become less so while I was with them . "

Soon we were leaving the Shrieking Shack and roaming the school grounds and the village by night . Sirius and James transformed into such large animals , they were able to keep a werewolf in check . I doubt whether any Hogwarts students ever found out more about the Hogwarts grounds and Hogsmeade than we did ... And that 's how we came to write the Marauder 's Map , and sign it with our nicknames . Sirius is Padfoot . Peter is Wormtail . James was Prongs . "

VLupin 's face had hardened , and there was self-digust in his voice . " All this year , I have been battling with myself , wondering whether I should tell Dumbledore that Sirius was an Animagus . But I did n't do it . Why ? Because I was too cowardly . It would have meant admitting that I'd betrayed his trust while I was at school , admitting that I'd led others along with me ... and Dumbledore 's trust has meant everything to me . He let me into Hogwarts as a boy , and he gave me a job , when I have been shunned all my adult life , unable to find paid work because of what I am . And so I convinced myself that Sirius was getting into the school using dark arts he learned from Voldemort , that being an Animagus had nothing to do with it ... so , in a way , Snape 's been right about me all along .

He especially disliked James . Jealous , I think , of James 's talent on the Quidditch pitch ... anyway , Snape had seen me crossing the grounds with Madam Pomfrey one evening as she led me towards the Whomping Willow to transform . Sirius thought it would be - er - amusing , to tell Snape all he had to do was prod the knot on the tree-trunk with a long stick , and he'd be able to get in after me . Well , of course , Snape tried it - if he'd got as far as this house , he'd have met a fully grown werewolf - but your father , who'd heard what Sirius had done , went after Snape and pulled him back , at great risk to his life ... Snape glimpsed me , though , at the end of the tunnel . He was forbidden to tell anybody by Dumbledore , but from that time on he knew what I was ... "
