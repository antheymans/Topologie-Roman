The Sorting is a very important ceremony because , while you are here , your house will be something like your family within Hogwarts . You will have classes with the rest of your house , sleep in your house dormitory , and spend free time in your house common room .

At the end of the year , the house with the most points is awarded the house cup , a great honor . I hope each of you will be a credit to whichever house becomes yours .

V" This , " said Wood , " is the Golden Snitch , and it 's the most important ball of the lot . It 's very hard to catch because it 's so fast and difficult to see . It 's the Seeker 's job to catch it . You 've got to weave in and out of the Chasers , Beaters , Bludgers , and Quaffle to get it before the other team 's Seeker , because whichever Seeker catches the Snitch wins his team an extra hundred and fifty points , so they nearly always win . That 's why Seekers get fouled so much . A game of Quidditch only ends when the Snitch is caught , so it can go on for ages - I think the record is three months , they had to keep bringing on substitutes so the players could get some sleep .

D'you think he 'll leave you and your families alone if Gryffindor wins the house cup ? If I get caught before I can get to the Stone , well , I 'll have to go back to the Dursleys and wait for Voldemort to find me there , it 's only dying a bit later than I would have , because I 'm never going over to the Dark Side !
