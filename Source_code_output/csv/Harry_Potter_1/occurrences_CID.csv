" Little tyke , " chortled Mr. Dursley as he left the house .;Dursley;;-0.09375;20;0
" The Potters , that 's right , that 's what I heard - ";Dursley;;0.285714285714;56;1
" - yes , their son , Harry - ";Dursley;;0.0;57;1
" Sorry , " he grunted , as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell .;Dursley;;-0.133333333333;72;2
On the contrary , his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare , " Do n't be sorry , my dear sir , for nothing could upset me today ! Rejoice , for You-Know-Who has gone at last ! Even Muggles like yourself should be celebrating , this happy , happy day ! ";Dursley;You-Know-Who,;0.260416666667;75;2
" Shoo ! ";Dursley;;0.0;85;3
She told him over dinner all about Mrs. Next Door 's problems with her daughter and how Dudley had learned a new word ( " Wo n't ! " ) .;Dudley;Dursley,;0.0852272727273;94;4
" And finally , bird-watchers everywhere have reported that the nation 's owls have been behaving very unusually today . Although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight , there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise . Experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern . ";Dudley;Dursley,;-0.15;97;4
The newscaster allowed himself a grin . " Most mysterious . And now , over to Jim McGuffin with the weather . Going to be any more showers of owls tonight , Jim ? ";Dudley;Dursley,;0.333333333333;98;4
" Well , Ted , " said the weatherman , " I do n't know about that , but it 's not only the owls that have been acting oddly today . Viewers as far apart as Kent , Yorkshire , and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I promised yesterday , they 've had a downpour of shooting stars ! Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Night early - it 's not until next week , folks ! But I can promise a wet night tonight . ";Dursley;Dundee,Night,;0.0302083333333;99;4
He cleared his throat nervously . " Er - Petunia , dear - you have n't heard from your sister lately , have you ? ";Dursley;Mrs.,;0.0;108;5
" No , " she said sharply . " Why ? ";Dursley;Mrs.,;0.0;111;5
" Funny stuff on the news , " Mr. Dursley mumbled . " Owls...shooting stars...and there were a lot of funny-looking people in town today ... ";Dursley;Mrs.,;0.25;112;5
" So ? ";Dursley;Mrs.,;0.0;113;5
" Well , I just thought...maybe...it was something to do with...you know...her crowd . ";Dursley;Mrs.,;0.0;115;5
Mr. Dursley wondered whether he dared tell her he'd heard the name " Potter . ";Dursley;Mrs.,;0.0;117;5
Instead he said , as casually as he could , " Their son - he'd be about Dudley 's age now , would n't he ? ";Dursley;Mrs.,;0.0;119;5
" I suppose so , " said Mrs. Dursley stiffly .;Mrs.;Dursley,;0.0;120;5
" What 's his name again ? Howard , is n't it ? ";Dursley;Mrs.,;0.0;121;5
" Harry . Nasty , common name , if you ask me . ";Dursley;Mrs.,;-0.65;122;5
" Oh , yes , " said Mr. Dursley , his heart sinking horribly . " Yes , I quite agree . ";Dursley;Mrs.,;0.0;123;5
He chuckled and muttered , " I should have known . ";Dumbledore;;0.0;151;6
" Fancy seeing you here , Professor McGonagall . ";Dumbledore;Fancy,;0.0;161;7
" How did you know it was me ? ";Professor;Dumbledore,Dursley,gently,McGonagall,Voldemort,calmly,Hagrid,Dudley,;0.0;167;7
" My dear Professor , I 've never seen a cat sit so stiffly . ";Dumbledore;Professor,Dursley,gently,McGonagall,Voldemort,calmly,Hagrid,Dudley,;0.0;169;7
" You'd be stiff if you'd been sitting on a brick wall all day , " said Professor McGonagall .;Professor;You'd,;-0.214285714286;170;7
" All day ? When you could have been celebrating ? I must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here . ";Dumbledore;Professor,Dursley,gently,McGonagall,Voldemort,calmly,Hagrid,Dudley,;0.0;171;7
" Oh yes , I 've celebrating , all right , " she said impatiently . " You'd think they'd be a bit more careful , but no - even the Muggles have noticed something 's going on . It was on their news . ";Professor;You'd,;0.228571428571;173;7
She jerked her head back at the Dursleys ' dark living-room window . " I heard it . Flocks of owls...shooting stars...Well , they 're not completely stupid . They were bound to notice something . Shooting stars down in Kent - I 'll bet that was Dedalus Diggle . He never had much sense . ";Dursley;Diggle,;-0.201111111111;174;7
" You ca n't blame them , " said Dumbledore gently . " We 've had precious little to celebrate for eleven years . ";gently;Dumbledore,Professor,Dursley,McGonagall,Voldemort,calmly,Hagrid,Dudley,;0.15625;175;7
" I know that , " said Professor McGonagall irritably . " But that 's no reason to lose our heads . People are being downright careless , out on the streets in broad daylight , not even dressed in Muggle clothes , swapping rumors . ";Professor;Dumbledore,Dursley,gently,McGonagall,Voldemort,calmly,Hagrid,Dudley,;-0.21875;176;7
She threw a sharp , sideways glance at Dumbledore here , as though hoping he was going to tell her something , but he did n't , so she went on . " A fine thing it would be if , on the very day You-Know-Who seems to have disappeared at last , the Muggles found out about us all . I suppose he really has gone , Dumbledore ? ";Dumbledore;You-Know-Who,;0.0983333333333;177;7
" It certainly seems so , " said Dumbledore . " We have much to be thankful for . Would you care for a lemon drop ? ";Dumbledore;Professor,Dursley,gently,McGonagall,Voldemort,calmly,Hagrid,Dudley,;0.1;178;7
" A what ? ";Professor;Dumbledore,Dursley,gently,McGonagall,Voldemort,calmly,Hagrid,Dudley,;0.0;179;7
" A lemon drop . They 're a kind of Muggle sweet I 'm rather fond of . ";Dumbledore;Professor,Dursley,gently,McGonagall,Voldemort,calmly,Hagrid,Dudley,;0.475;180;7
" No , thank you , " said Professor McGonagall coldly , as though she did n't think this was the moment for lemon drops . " As I say , even if You-Know-Who has gone - ";McGonagall;You-Know-Who,;0.0;181;7
" My dear Professor , surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by his name ? All this ' You-Know-Who ' nonsense - for eleven years I have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name : Voldemort . ";Dumbledore;You-Know-Who,;0.0;182;7
Professor McGonagall flinched , but Dumbledore , who was unsticking two lemon drops , seemed not to notice . " It all gets so confusing if we keep saying ' You-Know-Who . ' I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort 's name . ";Professor;Voldemort,;-0.3;183;7
" I know you have n't , said Professor McGonagall , sounding half exasperated , half admiring . ";Dumbledore;Professor,;-0.166666666667;184;7
Everyone knows you 're the only one You-Know - oh , all right , Voldemort , was frightened of . ";Voldemort;Dumbledore,Professor,Dursley,gently,McGonagall,calmly,Hagrid,Dudley,;0.142857142857;186;7
" You flatter me , " said Dumbledore calmly . " Voldemort had powers I will never have . ";calmly;Voldemort,;0.0;187;7
" Only because you 're too - well - noble to use them . ";Dumbledore;Professor,Dursley,gently,McGonagall,Voldemort,calmly,Hagrid,Dudley,;0.3;188;7
" It 's lucky it 's dark . I have n't blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs . ";Hagrid;Pomfrey,;0.203939393939;189;7
Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and said " The owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around . You know what they 're saying ? About why he 's disappeared ? About what finally stopped him ? ";Professor;Dumbledore,Dursley,gently,McGonagall,Voldemort,calmly,Hagrid,Dudley,;-0.0625;190;7
It was plain that whatever " everyone " was saying , she was not going to believe it until Dumbledore told her it was true .;Dumbledore;Professor,Dursley,gently,McGonagall,Voldemort,calmly,Hagrid,Dudley,;0.0678571428571;192;7
" What they 're saying , " she pressed on , " is that last night Voldemort turned up in Godric 's Hollow . He went to find the Potters . The rumor is that Lily and James Potter are - are - that they 're - dead . ";Professor;Voldemort,Potter,;-0.1;194;7
" Lily and James...I ca n't believe it...I did n't want to believe it...Oh , Albus ... ";Hagrid;Potter,;0.0;197;7
Dumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder . " I know...I know ... ";Dumbledore;Professor,Dursley,gently,McGonagall,Voldemort,calmly,Hagrid,Dudley,;0.0;198;7
Professor McGonagall 's voice trembled as she went on . " That 's not all . They 're saying he tried to kill the Potter 's son , Harry . But he could n't . He could n't kill that little boy . No one knows why , or how , but they 're saying that when he could n't kill Harry Potter , Voldemort 's power somehow broke - and that 's why he 's gone . ";Professor;Potter,;-0.1875;200;7
" It 's - it 's true ? ";Dumbledore;Professor,Dursley,gently,McGonagall,Voldemort,calmly,Hagrid,Dudley,;0.35;202;7
faltered Professor McGonagall . " After all he 's done...all the people he 's killed...he could n't kill a little boy ? It 's just astounding...of all the things to stop him...but how in the name of heaven did Harry survive ? ";Professor;Harry,;-0.1875;203;7
" We can only guess . ";Hagrid;Dumbledore,Professor,Dursley,gently,McGonagall,Voldemort,calmly,Dudley,;0.0;204;7
said Dumbledore . " We may never know . ";Dumbledore;Professor,Dursley,gently,McGonagall,Voldemort,calmly,Hagrid,Dudley,;0.0;205;7
It must have made sense to Dumbledore , though , because he put it back in his pocket and said , " Hagrid 's late . I suppose it was he who told you I'd be here , by the way ? ";Dumbledore;I'd,;-0.15;210;7
" Yes , " said Professor McGonagall . " And I do n't suppose you 're going to tell me why you 're here , of all places ? ";Professor;Dumbledore,Dursley,gently,McGonagall,Voldemort,calmly,Hagrid,Dudley,;0.0;211;7
" I 've come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle . They 're the only family he has left now . ";Dumbledore;Harry,;0.0;212;7
" You do n't mean - you ca n't mean the people who live here ? ";Hagrid;Dumbledore,Professor,Dursley,gently,McGonagall,Voldemort,calmly,Dudley,;-0.162878787879;213;7
cried Professor McGonagall , jumping to her feet and pointing at number four . " Dumbledore - you ca n't . I 've been watching them all day . You could n't find two people who are less like us . And they 've got this son - I saw him kicking his mother all the way up the street , screaming for sweets . Harry Potter come and live here ! ";Professor;Harry,;-0.0189393939394;214;7
" It 's the best place for him , " said Dumbledore firmly . " His aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when he 's older . I 've written them a letter . ";Dumbledore;Professor,Dursley,gently,McGonagall,Voldemort,calmly,Hagrid,Dudley,;0.555555555556;215;7
" A letter ? ";Hagrid;Dumbledore,Professor,Dursley,gently,McGonagall,Voldemort,calmly,Dudley,;0.0;216;7
repeated Professor McGonagall faintly , sitting back down on the wall . " Really , Dumbledore , you think you can explain all this in a letter ? These people will never understand him ! He 'll be famous - a legend - I would n't be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter day in the future - there will be books written about Harry - every child in our world will know his name ! ";Professor;Dumbledore,Dursley,gently,McGonagall,Voldemort,calmly,Hagrid,Dudley,;0.0925925925926;217;7
" Exactly . ";Hagrid;Dumbledore,Professor,Dursley,gently,McGonagall,Voldemort,calmly,Dudley,;0.0;218;7
said Dumbledore , looking very seriously over the top of his half-moon glasses . " It would be enough to turn any boy 's head . Famous before he can walk and talk ! Famous for something he wo n't even remember ! Can you see how much better off he 'll be , growing up away from all that until he 's ready to take it ? ";Dumbledore;Professor,Dursley,gently,McGonagall,Voldemort,calmly,Hagrid,Dudley,;0.35390625;219;7
Professor McGonagall opened her mouth , changed her mind , swallowed , and then said , " Yes - yes , you 're right , of course . But how is the boy getting here , Dumbledore ? ";Professor;Dumbledore,Dursley,gently,McGonagall,Voldemort,calmly,Hagrid,Dudley,;0.285714285714;220;7
" Hagrid 's bringing him . ";Dumbledore;Professor,Dursley,gently,McGonagall,Voldemort,calmly,Hagrid,Dudley,;0.0;222;7
" You think it - wise - to trust Hagrid with something as important as this ? ";Professor;Hagrid,;0.55;223;7
" I would trust Hagrid with my life , " said Dumbledore .;Dumbledore;Hagrid,;0.0;224;7
" I 'm not saying his heart is n't in the right place , " said Professor McGonagall grudgingly , " but you ca n't pretend he 's not careless . He does tend to - what was that ? ";Professor;Dumbledore,Dursley,gently,McGonagall,Voldemort,calmly,Hagrid,Dudley,;-0.107142857143;225;7
" Hagrid , " said Dumbledore , sounding relieved . " At last . And where did you get that motorcycle ? ";Dumbledore;Professor,Dursley,gently,McGonagall,Voldemort,calmly,Hagrid,Dudley,;0.0;232;7
" Borrowed it , Professor Dumbledore , sir , " said the giant , climbing carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke . " Young Sirius Black lent it to me . I 've got him , sir . ";Professor;Black,;-0.0222222222222;233;7
" No problems , were there ? ";Dumbledore;Professor,Dursley,gently,McGonagall,Voldemort,calmly,Hagrid,Dudley,;0.0;234;7
" No , sir - house was almost destroyed , but I got him out all right before the Muggles started swarmin ' around . He fell asleep as we was flyin ' over Bristol . ";Professor;Muggles,;0.285714285714;235;7
" Is that where - ? ";Hagrid;Dumbledore,Professor,Dursley,gently,McGonagall,Voldemort,calmly,Dudley,;0.0;239;7
" Yes , " said Dumbledore . " He 'll have that scar forever . ";Dumbledore;Professor,Dursley,gently,McGonagall,Voldemort,calmly,Hagrid,Dudley,;0.0;241;7
" Could n't you do something about it , Dumbledore ? ";Professor;Dumbledore,Dursley,gently,McGonagall,Voldemort,calmly,Hagrid,Dudley,;0.0;242;7
" Even if I could , I would n't . Scars can come in handy . I have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the London Underground . Well - give him here , Hagrid - we'd better get this over with . ";Dumbledore;Professor,Dursley,gently,McGonagall,Voldemort,calmly,Hagrid,Dudley,;0.42;243;7
" Could I - could I say good-bye to him , sir ? ";Professor;Dumbledore,Dursley,gently,McGonagall,Voldemort,calmly,Hagrid,Dudley,;0.0;245;7
" Shhh ! ";Dumbledore;Professor,Dursley,gently,McGonagall,Voldemort,calmly,Hagrid,Dudley,;0.0;249;7
hissed Professor McGonagall , " You 'll wake the Muggles ! ";Professor;Muggles,;0.0;250;7
" S-s-sorry , " sobbed Hagrid , taking out a large , spotted handkerchief and burying his face in it . " But I c-c-ca n't stand it - Lily an ' James dead - an ' poor little Harry off ter live with Muggles - ";Hagrid;Little,Potter,;-0.0873701298701;251;7
" Yes , yes , it 's all very sad , but get a grip on yourself , Hagrid , or we 'll be found , " Professor McGonagall whispered , patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door .;Professor;Dumbledore,Dursley,gently,McGonagall,Voldemort,calmly,Hagrid,Dudley,;-0.325;252;7
" Well , " said Dumbledore finally , " that 's that . We 've no business staying here . We may as well go and join the celebrations . ";Dumbledore;Professor,Dursley,gently,McGonagall,Voldemort,calmly,Hagrid,Dudley,;0.0;255;7
" Yeah , " said Hagrid in a very muffled voice , " I 'll be takin ' Sirius his bike back . G'night , Professor McGonagall - Professor Dumbledore , sir . ";Hagrid;Dumbledore,Professor,Dursley,gently,McGonagall,Voldemort,calmly,Dudley,;0.1;256;7
" I shall see you soon , I expect , Professor McGonagall , " said Dumbledore , nodding to her .;Dumbledore;Professor,Dursley,gently,McGonagall,Voldemort,calmly,Hagrid,Dudley,;0.0;258;7
" Good luck , Harry , " he murmured .;Professor;Dumbledore,Dursley,gently,McGonagall,Voldemort,calmly,Hagrid,Dudley,;0.65;264;7
One small hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on , not knowing he was special , not knowing he was famous , not knowing he would be woken in a few hours ' time by Mrs. Dursley 's scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk bottles , nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin Dudley....He could n't know that at this very moment , people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices : " To Harry Potter - the boy who lived ! ";Dudley;Dumbledore,Professor,Dursley,gently,McGonagall,Voldemort,calmly,Hagrid,;-0.0214285714286;268;7
" Up ! Get up ! Now ! ";Harry;;0.0;281;8
" Up ! ";Harry;;0.0;284;8
" Are you up yet ? ";Harry;;0.0;292;8
" Nearly , " said Harry .;Harry;;0.0;294;8
" Well , get a move on , I want you to look after the bacon . And do n't you dare let it burn , I want everything perfect on Duddy 's birthday . ";Harry;;1.0;295;8
" What did you say ? ";Harry;;0.0;297;8
" Nothing , nothing ... ";Harry;;0.0;299;8
" In the car crash when your parents died , " she had said . " And do n't ask questions . ";Dursley;;0.0;316;9
" Comb your hair ! ";Dursley;;0.0;319;9
" Thirty-six , " he said , looking up at his mother and father . " That 's two less than last year . ";Dudley;Aunt,Harry,Uncle,;-0.0833333333333;330;10
" Darling , you have n't counted Auntie Marge 's present , see , it 's here under this big one from Mummy and Daddy . ";Harry;Marge,;0.0;331;10
" All right , thirty-seven then , " said Dudley , going red in the face .;Dudley;Aunt,Harry,Uncle,;0.142857142857;332;10
Aunt Petunia obviously scented danger , too , because she said quickly , " And we 'll buy you another two presents while we 're out today . How 's that , popkin ? Two more presents . Is that all right ";Harry;Dudley,Aunt,Uncle,;0.392857142857;334;10
Finally he said slowly , " So I 'll have thirty...thirty ... ";Dudley;Aunt,Harry,Uncle,;0.0;337;10
" Thirty-nine , sweetums , " said Aunt Petunia .;Aunt;Dudley,Harry,Uncle,;0.0;338;10
" Oh. " Dudley sat down heavily and grabbed the nearest parcel . " All right then . ";Dudley;Aunt,Harry,Uncle,;0.0650793650794;339;10
" Little tyke wants his money 's worth , just like his father . ' Atta boy , Dudley ! ";Aunt;Dudley,Harry,Uncle,;0.130208333333;341;10
" Bad news , Vernon , " she said . " Mrs. Figg 's broken her leg . She ca n't take him . ";Harry;Dudley,Aunt,Uncle,;-0.508333333333;345;10
" Now what ? ";Dudley;Aunt,Harry,Uncle,;0.0;352;10
" We could phone Marge , " Uncle Vernon suggested .;Uncle;Marge,;0.0;355;10
" Do n't be silly , Vernon , she hates the boy . ";Harry;Dudley,Aunt,Uncle,;-0.5;356;10
" What about what ' s-her-name , your friend - Yvonne ? ";Dudley;Aunt,Harry,Uncle,;0.0;358;10
" On vacation in Majorca , " snapped Aunt Petunia .;Aunt;Dudley,Harry,Uncle,;0.0;359;10
" You could just leave me here , " Harry put in hopefully ( he'd be able to watch what he wanted on television for a change and maybe even have a go on Dudley 's computer ) .;Harry;Dudley,Aunt,Uncle,;0.5;360;10
" And come back and find the house in ruins ? ";Dudley;Aunt,Harry,Uncle,;0.0;362;10
" I wo n't blow up the house , " said Harry , but they were n't listening .;Harry;Dudley,Aunt,Uncle,;0.0;364;10
" I suppose we could take him to the zoo , " said Aunt Petunia slowly , " ...and leave him in the car ... ";Aunt;Dudley,Harry,Uncle,;0.0;365;10
" That car 's new , he 's not sitting in it alone ... ";Harry;Dudley,Aunt,Uncle,;0.136363636364;366;10
" Dinky Duddydums , do n't cry , Mummy wo n't let him spoil your special day ! ";Dudley;Aunt,Harry,Uncle,;0.446428571429;369;10
" I...do n't...want...him...t-t-to come ! ";Harry;Dudley,Aunt,Uncle,;0.0;371;10
Dudley yelled between huge , pretend sobs . " He always sp-spoils everything ! ";Dudley;Aunt,Harry,Uncle,;0.5;372;10
Just then , the doorbell rang - " Oh , good Lord , they 're here ! ";Aunt;Dudley,Harry,Uncle,;0.8125;374;10
" I 'm warning you , " he had said , putting his large purple face right up close to Harry ' s , " I 'm warning you now , boy - any funny business , anything at all - and you 'll be in that cupboard from now until Christmas . ";Harry;Dudley,Aunt,Uncle,;0.25;381;10
" I 'm not going to do anything , " said Harry , " honestly ... ";Harry;Dudley,Aunt,Uncle,;0.0;382;10
Once , Aunt Petunia , tired of Harry coming back from the barbers looking as though he had n't been at all , had taken a pair of kitchen scissors and cut his hair so short he was almost bald except for his bangs , which she left " to hide that horrible scar . ";Harry;Dudley,Aunt,Uncle,;-0.28;386;10
" ...roaring along like maniacs , the young hoodlums , " he said , as a motorcycle overtook them .;Harry;;0.1;402;11
" I had a dream about a motorcycle , " said Harry , remembering suddenly . " It was flying . ";Harry;;0.0;403;11
He turned right around in his seat and yelled at Harry , his face like a gigantic beet with a mustache : " MOTORCYCLES DON'T FLY ! ";Harry;;0.678571428571;405;11
" I know they do n't , " said Harry . " It was only a dream . ";Harry;;0.0;407;11
" Make it move , " he whined at his father .;Dudley;;0.0;425;12
" Do it again , " Dudley ordered .;Dudley;;0.0;427;12
" This is boring , " Dudley moaned .;Dudley;;-1.0;429;12
" I get that all the time . ";Aunt;Harry,Piers,;0.0;443;13
" I know , " Harry murmured through the glass , though he was n't sure the snake could hear him . " It must be really annoying . ";Harry;Piers,Aunt,;-0.55;444;13
" Where do you come from , anyway ? ";Aunt;Harry,Piers,;0.0;446;13
" Was it nice there ? ";Piers;Harry,Aunt,;0.6;451;13
The boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again and Harry read on : This specimen was bred in the zoo . " Oh , I see - so you 've never been to Brazil ? ";Harry;Piers,Aunt,;0.0;452;13
As the snake shook its head , a deafening shout behind Harry made both of them jump . " DUDLEY ! MR . DURSLEY ! COME AND LOOK AT THIS SNAKE ! YOU WON'T BELIEVE WHAT IT'S DOING ! ";Harry;Piers,Aunt,;-0.55078125;453;13
" Out of the way , you , " he said , punching Harry in the ribs .;Harry;Piers,Aunt,;0.0;455;13
As the snake slid swiftly past him , Harry could have sworn a low , hissing voice said , " Brazil , here I come ... Thanksss , amigo . ";Harry;Piers,Aunt,;-0.125;461;13
" But the glass , " he kept saying , " where did the glass go ? ";Aunt;Harry,Piers,;0.0;463;13
But worst of all , for Harry at least , was Piers calming down enough to say , " Harry was talking to it , were n't you , Harry ? ";Piers;Harry,;-0.363888888889;467;13
He managed to say , " Go - cupboard - stay - no meals , " before he collapsed into a chair , and Aunt Petunia had to run and get him a large brandy .;Aunt;Harry,Piers,;0.214285714286;470;13
" They stuff people 's heads down the toilet the first day at Stonewall , " he told Harry . " Want to come upstairs and practice ? ";Harry;;0.0472222222222;508;14
" No , thanks , " said Harry . " The poor toilet 's never had anything as horrible as your head down it - it might be sick . ";Harry;;-0.413968253968;509;14
" What 's this ? ";Aunt;Uncle,Harry,;0.0;527;15
" Your new school uniform , " she said .;Uncle;Aunt,Harry,;0.136363636364;530;15

" Watching - spying - might be following us , " muttered Uncle Vernon wildly .;Vernon;Uncle,Aunt,suddenly,Harry,furiously,Dudley,;0.0;599;16

said Harry , the moment Uncle Vernon had squeezed through the door . " Who 's writing to me ? ";Uncle;angrily,Harry,Dudley,;0.0;608;17
" No one . It was addressed to you by mistake , " said Uncle Vernon shortly . " I have burned it . ";Uncle;angrily,Harry,Dudley,;0.0;609;17
" It was not a mistake , " said Harry angrily , " it had my cupboard on it . ";angrily;Uncle,Harry,Dudley,;0.0;610;17
" SILENCE ! ";Dudley;Uncle,angrily,Harry,;0.0;611;17
" Er - yes , Harry - about this cupboard . Your aunt and I have been thinking...you 're really getting a bit big for it...we think it might be nice if you moved into Dudley 's second bedroom .;Uncle;angrily,Harry,Dudley,;0.15;614;17

Then he shouted , " There 's another one ! ' Mr. H. Potter , The Smallest Bedroom , 4 Privet Drive - ' ";Harry;;0.0;638;18

" AAAAARRRGH ! ";Uncle;Aunt,;0.0;655;19
" I want - " he began , but Uncle Vernon was tearing the letters into pieces before his eyes .;Uncle;Aunt,;0.0;662;19
" See , " he explained to Aunt Petunia through a mouthful of nails , " if they ca n't deliver them they 'll just give up . ";Aunt;Uncle,;0.0;665;19
" I 'm not sure that 'll work , Vernon . ";Uncle;Aunt,;0.5;666;19
" Oh , these people 's minds work in strange ways , Petunia , they 're not like you and me , " said Uncle Vernon , trying to knock in a nail with the piece of fruitcake Aunt Petunia had just brought him .;Aunt;Uncle,;-0.05;667;19
He hummed " Tiptoe Through the Tulips " as he worked , and jumped at small noises .;Uncle;;-0.25;673;20
" Who on earth wants to talk to you this badly ? ";Uncle;earth,;0.2;678;21
" No post on Sundays , " he reminded them cheerfully as he spread marmalade on his newspapers , " no damn letters today - ";Uncle;;0.0;682;21
" Out ! OUT ! ";Uncle;;0.0;686;21
" That does it , " said Uncle Vernon , trying to speak calmly but pulling great tufts out of his mustache at the same time . " I want you all back here in five minutes ready to leave . We 're going away . Just pack some clothes . No arguments ! ";Uncle;;0.2625;690;21
" Shake ' em off...shake ' em off , " he would mutter whenever he did this .;Uncle;;0.0;698;21
" ' Scuse me , but is one of you Mr. H. Potter ? Only I got about an ' undred of these at the front desk . ";;;0.0;709;22

" Daddy 's gone mad , has n't he ? ";Aunt;Uncle,Vernon,;-0.625;726;23
" It 's Monday , " he told his mother . " The Great Humberto 's on tonight . I want to stay somewhere with a television . ";Uncle;Monday,;0.8;732;23

" Storm forecast for tonight ! ";Aunt;Uncle,Vernon,;0.0;746;23
said Uncle Vernon gleefully , clapping his hands together . " And this gentleman 's kindly agreed to lend us his boat ! ";Vernon;Uncle,Aunt,;0.0;747;23
" I 've already got us some rations , " said Uncle Vernon , " so all aboard ! ";Uncle;Aunt,Vernon,;0.0;749;23
" Could do with some of those letters now , eh ? ";Aunt;Uncle,Vernon,;0.0;757;23
" Where 's the cannon ? ";Dudley;;0.0;794;24
" Who 's there ? ";Dudley;;0.0;798;24
he shouted . " I warn you - I 'm armed ! ";Dudley;;0.0;799;24
" Could n't make us a cup o ' tea , could yeh ? It 's not been an easy journey ... ";Dudley;Uncle,Vernon,Dursley,Harry,Hagrid,;0.433333333333;810;25
" Budge up , yeh great lump , " said the stranger .;Hagrid;Dudley,Uncle,Vernon,Dursley,Harry,;0.8;812;25
" An ' here 's Harry ! ";Uncle;Dudley,Vernon,Dursley,Harry,Hagrid,;0.0;814;25
" Las ' time I saw you , you was only a baby , " said the giant . " Yeh look a lot like yer dad , but yeh 've got yer mom 's eyes . ";Hagrid;Yeh,;0.0;817;25
" I demand that you leave at once , sir ! ";Uncle;Dudley,Vernon,Dursley,Harry,Hagrid,;0.0;819;25
he said . " You are breaking and entering ! ";Hagrid;Dudley,Uncle,Vernon,Dursley,Harry,;0.0;820;25
" Ah , shut up , Dursley , yeh great prune , " said the giant ; he reached over the back of the sofa , jerked the gun out of Uncle Vernon 's hands , bent it into a knot as easily as if it had been made of rubber , and threw it into a corner of the room .;Vernon;Dudley,Uncle,Dursley,Harry,Hagrid,;0.266666666667;821;25
" Anyway - Harry , " said the giant , turning his back on the Dursleys , " a very happy birthday to yeh . Got summat fer yeh here - I mighta sat on it at some point , but it 'll taste all right . ";Dursley;Dudley,Uncle,Vernon,Harry,Hagrid,;0.321428571429;823;25
He meant to say thank you , but the words got lost on the way to his mouth , and what he said instead was , " Who are you ? ";Hagrid;Dudley,Uncle,Vernon,Dursley,Harry,;0.0;828;25
" True , I have n't introduced meself . Rubeus Hagrid , Keeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts . ";Harry;Dudley,Uncle,Vernon,Dursley,Hagrid,;0.35;830;25
" What about that tea then , eh ? ";Hagrid;Dudley,Uncle,Vernon,Dursley,Harry,;0.0;832;25
he said , rubbing his hands together . " I'd not say no ter summat stronger if yeh 've got it , mind . ";Harry;I'd,;0.0;833;25
Uncle Vernon said sharply , " Do n't touch anything he gives you , Dudley . ";Uncle;Dudley,Vernon,Dursley,Harry,Hagrid,;0.0;840;25
" Yer great puddin ' of a son don ' need fattenin ' anymore , Dursley , don ' worry . ";Hagrid;Dudley,Uncle,Vernon,Dursley,Harry,;0.8;842;25
Finally , as nobody seemed about to explain anything , he said , " I 'm sorry , but I still do n't really know who you are . ";Harry;Dudley,Uncle,Vernon,Dursley,Hagrid,;-0.25;844;25
" Call me Hagrid , " he said , " everyone does . An ' like I told yeh , I 'm Keeper of Keys at Hogwarts - yeh 'll know all about Hogwarts , o ' course .;Hagrid;Hagrid,Hogwarts,;0.0;846;25
" Er - no , " said Harry .;Harry;Dudley,Uncle,Vernon,Dursley,Hagrid,;0.0;847;25
" Sorry , " Harry said quickly .;Harry;Dudley,Uncle,Vernon,Dursley,Hagrid,;-0.5;849;25
" Sorry ? ";Uncle;Dudley,Vernon,Dursley,Harry,Hagrid,;-0.5;850;25
barked Hagrid , turning to stare at the Dursleys , who shrank back into the shadows . " It 's them as should be sorry ! I knew yeh were n't gettin ' yer letters but I never thought yeh would n't even know abou ' Hogwarts , fer cryin ' out loud ! Did yeh never wonder where yer parents learned it all ?

" All what ? ";Uncle;Dudley,Vernon,Dursley,Harry,Hagrid,;0.0;852;25
" ALL WHAT ? ";Harry;Dudley,Uncle,Vernon,Dursley,Hagrid,;0.0;854;25
Hagrid thundered . " Now wait jus ' one second ! ";Hagrid;Dudley,Uncle,Vernon,Dursley,Harry,;0.0;855;25
" Do you mean ter tell me , " he growled at the Dursleys , " that this boy - this boy ! - knows nothin ' abou ' - about ANYTHING ? ";Dursley;Dudley,Uncle,Vernon,Harry,Hagrid,;-0.390625;859;25
" I know some things , " he said . " I can , you know , do math and stuff . ";Uncle;Dudley,Vernon,Dursley,Harry,Hagrid,;0.0;862;25
But Hagrid simply waved his hand and said , " About our world , I mean . Your world . My world . Yer parents ' world . ";Hagrid;Dudley,Uncle,Vernon,Dursley,Harry,;-0.3125;863;25
" What world ? ";Uncle;Dudley,Vernon,Dursley,Harry,Hagrid,;0.0;864;25
" DURSLEY ! ";Hagrid;Dudley,Uncle,Vernon,Dursley,Harry,;0.0;866;25
Uncle Vernon , who had gone very pale , whispered something that sounded like " Mimblewimble . ";Uncle;Dudley,Vernon,Dursley,Harry,Hagrid,;0.2;868;25
" But yeh must know about yer mom and dad , " he said . " I mean , they 're famous . You 're famous . ";Hagrid;Dudley,Uncle,Vernon,Dursley,Harry,;0.229166666667;870;25
" What ? My - my mom and dad were n't famous , were they ? ";Uncle;Dudley,Vernon,Dursley,Harry,Hagrid,;0.5;871;25
" Yeh don ' know...yeh don ' know ... ";Hagrid;Yeh,;0.0;872;25
" Yeh don ' know what yeh are ? ";Harry;Yeh,;0.0;874;25
" Stop ! ";Uncle;Dudley,Vernon,Dursley,Harry,Hagrid,;0.0;877;25
he commanded . " Stop right there , sir ! I forbid you to tell the boy anything ! ";Harry;Dudley,Uncle,Vernon,Dursley,Hagrid,;0.446428571429;878;25
" You never told him ? Never told him what was in the letter Dumbledore left fer him ? I was there ! I saw Dumbledore leave it , Dursley ! An ' you 've kept it from him all these years ? ";Hagrid;letter,Dumbledore,;0.0;880;25
" Kept what from me ? ";Uncle;Dudley,Vernon,Dursley,Harry,Hagrid,;0.0;881;25
" STOP ! I FORBID YOU ! ";Harry;Dudley,Uncle,Vernon,Dursley,Hagrid,;0.0;883;25
" Ah , go boil yer heads , both of yeh , " said Hagrid . " Harry - yer a wizard . ";Hagrid;Dudley,Uncle,Vernon,Dursley,Harry,;0.0;886;25
" I 'm a what ? ";Uncle;Dudley,Vernon,Dursley,Harry,Hagrid,;0.0;889;25
" A wizard , o ' course , " said Hagrid , sitting back down on the sofa , which groaned and sank even lower , " an ' a thumpin ' good ' un , I'd say , once yeh 've been trained up a bit . With a mum an ' dad like yours , what else would yeh be ? An ' I reckon it 's abou ' time yeh read yer letter . ";Hagrid;I'd,;0.164814814815;891;25
After a few minutes he stammered , " What does it mean , they await my owl ? ";Hagrid;;-0.25625;913;26
" Gallopin ' Gorgons , that reminds me , " said Hagrid , clapping a hand to his forehead with enough force to knock over a cart horse , and from yet another pocket inside his overcoat he pulled an owl - a real , live , rather ruffled-looking owl - a long quill , and a roll of parchment .;Hagrid;;0.0465909090909;914;26
" Where was I ? ";Hagrid;Uncle,Harry,Petunia,Dursley,loudly,;0.0;927;27
" He 's not going , " he said .;Harry;Hagrid,Uncle,Petunia,Dursley,loudly,;0.0;929;27
" I'd like ter see a great Muggle like you stop him , " he said .;Hagrid;I'd,Muggles,;0.8;931;27
" A what ? ";Harry;Hagrid,Uncle,Petunia,Dursley,loudly,;0.0;932;27
" A Muggle , " said Hagrid , " it 's what we call nonmagic folk like them . An ' it 's your bad luck you grew up in a family o ' the biggest Muggles I ever laid eyes on . ";Hagrid;Uncle,Harry,Petunia,Dursley,loudly,;-0.616666666667;934;27
" We swore when we took him in we'd put a stop to that rubbish , " said Uncle Vernon , " swore we'd stamp it out of him ! Wizard indeed ! ";Uncle;Hagrid,Harry,Petunia,Dursley,loudly,;0.0;935;27
" You knew ? ";Hagrid;Uncle,Harry,Petunia,Dursley,loudly,;0.0;936;27
said Harry . " You knew I 'm a - a wizard ? ";Harry;Hagrid,Uncle,Petunia,Dursley,loudly,;0.0;937;27
" Knew ! ";Hagrid;Uncle,Harry,Petunia,Dursley,loudly,;0.0;938;27
shrieked Aunt Petunia suddenly . " Knew ! Of course we knew ! How could you not be , my dratted sister being what she was ? Oh , she got a letter just like that and disappeared off to that - that school - and came home every vacation with her pockets full of frog spawn , turning teacups into rats . I was the only one who saw her for what she was - a freak ! But for my mother and father , oh no , it was Lily this and Lily that , they were proud of having a witch in the family ! ";Petunia;Lily,;0.515625;939;27
" Then she met that Potter at school and they left and got married and had you , and of course I knew you'd be just the same , just as strange , just as - as - abnormal - and then , if you please , she went and got herself blown up and we got landed with you ! ";Hagrid;Uncle,Harry,Petunia,Dursley,loudly,;0.0625;942;27
As soon as he found his voice he said , " Blown up ? You told me they died in a car crash ! ";Harry;Hagrid,Uncle,Petunia,Dursley,loudly,;0.0;944;27
" CAR CRASH ! ";Hagrid;Uncle,Harry,Petunia,Dursley,loudly,;0.0;945;27
roared Hagrid , jumping up so angrily that the Dursleys scuttled back to their corner . " How could a car crash kill Lily an ' James Potter ? It 's an outrage ! A scandal ! Harry Potter not knowin ' his own story when every kid in our world knows his name ! ";Dursley;Harry,Lily,;0.375;946;27
" But why ? What happened ? ";Hagrid;Uncle,Harry,Petunia,Dursley,loudly,;0.0;947;27
" I never expected this , " he said , in a low , worried voice . " I had no idea , when Dumbledore told me there might be trouble gettin ' hold of yeh , how much yeh did n't know . Ah , Harry , I don ' know if I 'm the right person ter tell yeh - but someone 's gotta - yeh ca n't go off ter Hogwarts not knowin ' . ";Dursley;Dumbledore,Hogwarts,;0.0714285714286;951;27
" Well , it 's best yeh know as much as I can tell yeh - mind , I ca n't tell yeh everythin ' , it 's a great myst'ry , parts of it ... ";Hagrid;Uncle,Harry,Petunia,Dursley,loudly,;0.633333333333;953;27
He sat down , stared into the fire for a few seconds , and then said , " It begins , I suppose , with - with a person called - but it 's incredible yeh do n't know his name , everyone in our world knows - ";Harry;Hagrid,Uncle,Petunia,Dursley,loudly,;0.181481481481;954;27
" Who ? ";Hagrid;Uncle,Harry,Petunia,Dursley,loudly,;0.0;955;27
" Well - I don ' like sayin ' the name if I can help it . No one does . ";Harry;Hagrid,Uncle,Petunia,Dursley,loudly,;0.0;956;27
" Why not ? ";Uncle;Hagrid,Harry,Petunia,Dursley,loudly,;0.0;957;27
" Gulpin ' gargoyles , Harry , people are still scared . Blimey , this is difficult . See , there was this wizard who went ...bad . As bad as you could go . Worse . Worse than worse . His name was ... ";Hagrid;Uncle,Harry,Petunia,Dursley,loudly,;-0.488888888889;958;27
" Could you write it down ? ";Harry;Hagrid,Uncle,Petunia,Dursley,loudly,;-0.155555555556;960;27
" Nah - ca n't spell it . All right - Voldemort . ";Uncle;Hagrid,Harry,Petunia,Dursley,loudly,;0.285714285714;962;27
Hagrid shuddered . " Don ' make me say it again . Anyway , this - this wizard , about twenty years ago now , started lookin ' fer followers . Got ' em , too - some were afraid , some just wanted a bit o ' his power , ' cause he was gettin ' himself power , all right . Dark days , Harry . Did n't know who ter trust , did n't dare get friendly with strange wizards or witches...terrible things happened . He was takin ' over . ' Course , some stood up to him - an ' he killed ' em . Horribly . One o ' the only safe places left was Hogwarts . Reckon Dumbledore 's the only one You-Know-Who was afraid of . Did n't dare try takin ' the school , not jus ' then , anyway .;Hagrid;Dumbledore,Hogwarts,;-0.0239285714286;963;27
" Now , yer mum an ' dad were as good a witch an ' wizard as I ever knew . Head boy an ' girl at Hogwarts in their day !

" Maybe he thought he could persuade ' em...maybe he just wanted ' em outta the way . All anyone knows is , he turned up in the village where you was all living , on Halloween ten years ago . You was just a year old . He came ter yer house an ' - an ' - ";Hagrid;Uncle,Harry,Petunia,Dursley,loudly,;0.05;965;27
" Sorry , " he said . " But it 's that sad - knew yer mum an ' dad , an ' nicer people yeh could n't find - anyway ...;Uncle;Hagrid,Harry,Petunia,Dursley,loudly,;-0.5;967;27
" You-Know-Who killed ' em . An ' then - an ' this is the real myst'ry of the thing - he tried to kill you , too . Wanted ter make a clean job of it , I suppose , or maybe he just liked killin ' by then . But he could n't do it . Never wondered how you got that mark on yer forehead ? That was no ordinary cut . That 's what yeh get when a powerful , evil curse touches yeh - took care of yer mum an ' dad an ' yer house , even - but it did n't work on you , an ' that 's why yer famous , Harry . No one ever lived after he decided ter kill ' em , no one except you , an ' he'd killed some o ' the best witches an ' wizards of the age - the McKinnons , the Bones , the Prewetts - an ' you was only a baby , an ' you lived .

" Load of old tosh , " said Uncle Vernon .;Uncle;Hagrid,Harry,Petunia,Dursley,loudly,;0.1;973;27
" Now , you listen here , boy , " he snarled , " I accept there 's something strange about you , probably nothing a good beating would n't have cured - and as for all this about your parents , well , they were weirdoes , no denying it , and the world 's better off without them in my opinion - asked for all they got , getting mixed up with these wizarding types - just what I expected , always knew they'd come to a sticky end - ";Hagrid;Uncle,Harry,Petunia,Dursley,loudly,;0.2;977;27
Pointing this at Uncle Vernon like a sword , he said , " I 'm warning you , Dursley - I 'm warning you - one more word ... ";Uncle;Hagrid,Harry,Petunia,Dursley,loudly,;0.5;979;27
" That 's better , " said Hagrid , breathing heavily and sitting back down on the sofa , which this time sagged right down to the floor .;Hagrid;Uncle,Harry,Petunia,Dursley,loudly,;0.0949206349206;981;27
" But what happened to Vol - , sorry - I mean , You-Know-Who ? ";Harry;Hagrid,Uncle,Petunia,Dursley,loudly,;-0.40625;983;27
" Good question , Harry . Disappeared . Vanished . Same night he tried ter kill you . Makes yeh even more famous . That 's the biggest myst'ry , see...he was gettin ' more an ' more powerful - why'd he go ?;Hagrid;Uncle,Harry,Petunia,Dursley,loudly,;0.421428571429;984;27
" Some say he died . Codswallop , in my opinion . Dunno if he had enough human left in him to die . Some say he 's still out there , bidin ' his time , like , but I don ' believe it .

Several boys of about Harry 's age had their noses pressed against a window with broomsticks in it .

" The gold ones are Galleons , " he explained . " Seventeen silver Sickles to a Galleon and twenty-nine Knuts to a Sickle , it 's easy enough . Right , that should be enough fer a couple o ' terms , we 'll keep the rest safe for yeh . ";Harry;Galleons,;0.24380952381;1308;33
He turned to Griphook . " Vault seven hundred and thirteen now , please , and can we go more slowly ? ";Griphook;Harry,Hagrid,;0.5;1309;33

" If anyone but a Gringotts goblin tried that , they'd be sucked through the door and trapped in there , " said Griphook .;Griphook;Harry,Hagrid,;0.0;1317;33

" Might as well get yer uniform , " said Hagrid , nodding toward Madam Malkin 's Robes for All Occasions . " Listen , Harry , would yeh mind if I slipped off fer a pick-me-up in the Leaky Cauldron ? I hate them Gringotts carts . ";Hagrid;Harry,coldly,gloomily,;-0.8;1330;34

" No , " said Harry , feeling more stupid by the minute .;Harry;Hagrid,coldly,gloomily,;-0.15;1348;34
" Well , no one really knows until they get there , do they , but I know I 'll be in Slytherin , all our family have been - imagine being in Hufflepuff , I think I'd leave , would n't you ? ";Hagrid;I'd,;0.0;1349;34
" Mmm , " said Harry , wishing he could say something a bit more interesting .;Harry;Hagrid,coldly,gloomily,;0.5;1350;34
" I say , look at that man ! ";Hagrid;Harry,coldly,gloomily,;0.0;1351;34
" That 's Hagrid , " said Harry , pleased to know something the boy did n't . " He works at Hogwarts . ";Harry;Hagrid,;0.5;1354;34

" He 's the gamekeeper , " said Harry .;Harry;Hagrid,coldly,gloomily,;0.0;1356;34
" Yes , exactly . I heard he 's a sort of savage - lives in a hut on the school grounds and every now and then he gets drunk , tries to do magic , and ends up setting fire to his bed . ";Hagrid;Harry,coldly,gloomily,;-0.0333333333333;1358;34

" They 're dead , " said Harry shortly .;Harry;Hagrid,coldly,gloomily,;-0.2;1362;34
" Oh , sorry , " said the other , not sounding sorry at all . " But they were our kind , were n't they ? ";Hagrid;Harry,coldly,gloomily,;-0.13125;1364;34
" They were a witch and wizard , if that 's what you mean . ";Harry;Hagrid,coldly,gloomily,;-0.3125;1365;34
" I really do n't think they should let the other sort in , do you ? They 're just not the same , they 've never been brought up to know our ways .

But before Harry could answer , Madam Malkin said , " That 's you done , my dear , " and Harry , not sorry for an excuse to stop talking to the boy , hopped down from the footstool .;Harry;Hagrid,coldly,gloomily,;-0.327777777778;1367;34

" I 'm not sayin ' that 's not a good idea , but yer not ter use magic in the Muggle world except in very special circumstances , " said Hagrid . " An ' anyway , yeh couldn ' work any of them curses yet , yeh 'll need a lot more study before yeh get ter that level . ";Hagrid;Harry,coldly,gloomily,;0.528571428571;1393;34
Hagrid would n't let Harry buy a solid gold cauldron , either ( " It says pewter on yer list " ) , but they got a nice set of scales for weighing potion ingredients and a collapsible brass telescope .;Hagrid;Harry,coldly,gloomily,;0.3;1394;34
" Just yer wand left - A yeah , an ' I still have n't got yeh a birthday present . ";gloomily;Hagrid,Harry,coldly,;0.0;1399;34
" You do n't have to - ";Harry;Hagrid,coldly,gloomily,;0.0;1401;34
" I know I do n't have to . Tell yeh what , I 'll get yer animal . Not a toad , toads went outta fashion years ago , yeh'd be laughed at - an ' I don ' like cats , they make me sneeze . I 'll get yer an owl . All the kids want owls , they 're dead useful , carry yer mail an ' everythin ' . ";gloomily;Hagrid,Harry,coldly,;0.266666666667;1402;34
" Don ' mention it , " said Hagrid gruffly . " Don ' expect you 've had a lotta presents from them Dursleys . Just Ollivanders left now - only place fer wands , Ollivanders , and yeh gotta have the best wand . ";Hagrid;Ollivander,;0.333333333333;1406;34
" Good afternoon , " said a soft voice .;Hagrid;Harry,quickly,Mr.,;0.375;1415;35
" Hello , " said Harry awkwardly .;Harry;Hagrid,quickly,Mr.,;0.0;1419;35
" Ah yes , " said the man . " Yes , yes . I thought I'd be seeing you soon . Harry Potter . ";Hagrid;I'd,;0.0;1420;35
It was n't a question . " You have your mother 's eyes . It seems only yesterday she was in here herself , buying her first wand . Ten and a quarter inches long , swishy , made of willow . Nice wand for charm work . ";Harry;Hagrid,quickly,Mr.,;0.16;1421;35
" Your father , on the other hand , favored a mahogany wand . Eleven inches . Pliable . A little more power and excellent for transfiguration . Well , I say your father favored it - it 's really the wand that chooses the wizard , of course . ";Hagrid;Harry,quickly,Mr.,;0.398214285714;1425;35
" And that 's where ... ";Harry;Hagrid,quickly,Mr.,;0.0;1428;35
" I 'm sorry to say I sold the wand that did it , " he said softly . " Thirteen-and-a-half inches . Yew . Powerful wand , very powerful , and in the wrong hands...well , if I'd known what that wand was going out into the world to do ... ";Hagrid;I'd,;-0.0775;1430;35
" Rubeus ! Rubeus Hagrid ! How nice to see you again....Oak , sixteen inches , rather bendy , was n't it ? ";Harry;Hagrid,quickly,Mr.,;0.6;1432;35
" It was , sir , yes , " said Hagrid .;Hagrid;Harry,quickly,Mr.,;0.0;1433;35
" Good wand , that one . But I suppose they snapped it in half when you got expelled ? ";Harry;Hagrid,quickly,Mr.,;0.241666666667;1434;35
" Er - yes , they did , yes , " said Hagrid , shuffling his feet . " I 've still got the pieces , though , " he added brightly .;Hagrid;Harry,quickly,Mr.,;0.0;1436;35
" But you do n't use them ? ";Harry;Hagrid,quickly,Mr.,;0.0;1437;35
" Oh , no , sir , " said Hagrid quickly .;quickly;Harry,Hagrid,Mr.,;0.0;1439;35
" Hmmm , " said Mr. Ollivander , giving Hagrid a piercing look . " Well , now - Mr. Potter . Let me see . ";Mr.;Harry,Hagrid,quickly,;0.0;1441;35
He pulled a long tape measure with silver markings out of his pocket . " Which is your wand arm ? ";Hagrid;Harry,quickly,Mr.,;-0.05;1442;35
" Er - well , I 'm right-handed , " said Harry .;Harry;Hagrid,quickly,Mr.,;0.0;1443;35
" Hold out your arm . That 's it . ";Hagrid;Harry,quickly,Mr.,;0.0;1444;35
As he measured , he said , " Every Ollivander wand has a core of a powerful magical substance , Mr. Potter . We use unicorn hairs , phoenix tail feathers , and the heartstrings of dragons . No two Ollivander wands are the same , just as no two unicorns , dragons , or phoenixes are quite the same . And of course , you will never get such good results with another wizard 's wand . ";Harry;Hagrid,quickly,Mr.,;0.241666666667;1446;35
" That will do , " he said , and the tape measure crumpled into a heap on the floor . " Right then , Mr. Potter . Try this one . Beechwood and dragon heartstring . Nine inches . Nice and flexible . just take it and give it a wave . ";Hagrid;Harry,quickly,Mr.,;0.442857142857;1449;35
" Maple and phoenix feather . Seven inches . Quite whippy . Try - ";Harry;Hagrid,quickly,Mr.,;0.0;1451;35
" No , no - here , ebony and unicorn hair , eight and a half inches , springy . Go on , go on , try it out . ";Hagrid;Harry,quickly,Mr.,;-0.166666666667;1453;35
" Tricky customer , eh ? Not to worry , we 'll find the perfect match here somewhere - I wonder , now - yes , why not - unusual combination - holly and phoenix feather , eleven inches , nice and supple . ";Harry;Hagrid,quickly,Mr.,;0.6;1458;35
Hagrid whooped and clapped and Mr. Ollivander cried , " Oh , bravo ! Yes , indeed , oh , very good . Well , well , well...how curious...how very curious ... ";Hagrid;Harry,quickly,Mr.,;0.3575;1462;35
He put Harry 's wand back into its box and wrapped it in brown paper , still muttering , " Curious...curious ...;Harry;Hagrid,quickly,Mr.,;0.0;1463;35
" Sorry , " said Harry , " but what 's curious ? ";Harry;Hagrid,quickly,Mr.,;-0.3;1464;35
" I remember every wand I 've ever sold , Mr. Potter . Every single wand . It so happens that the phoenix whose tail feather is in your wand , gave another feather - just one other . It is very curious indeed that you should be destined for this wand when its brother - why , its brother gave you that scar . ";Hagrid;Harry,quickly,Mr.,;-0.10880952381;1466;35
" Yes , thirteen-and-a-half inches . Yew . Curious indeed how these things happen . The wand chooses the wizard , remember...I think we must expect great things from you , Mr. Potter....After all , He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named did great things - terrible , yes , but great . ";Harry;He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named,;0.26;1468;35
" Got time fer a bite to eat before yer train leaves , " he said .;Hagrid;;0.0;1476;36
" You all right , Harry ? Yer very quiet , " said Hagrid .;Hagrid;;0.142857142857;1480;36
" Everyone thinks I 'm special , " he said at last . " All those people in the Leaky Cauldron , Professor Quirrell , Mr. Ollivander...but I do n't know anything about magic at all . How can they expect great things ? I 'm famous and I ca n't even remember what I 'm famous for . I do n't know what happened when Vol - , sorry - I mean , the night my parents died . ";Hagrid;;0.230580357143;1483;36
" Don ' you worry , Harry . You 'll learn fast enough . Everyone starts at the beginning at Hogwarts , you 'll be just fine . Just be yerself . I know it 's hard . Yeh 've been singled out , an ' that 's always hard . But yeh 'll have a great time at Hogwarts - I did - still do , ' smatter of fact . ";Hagrid;Yeh,;0.138888888889;1486;36
" Yer ticket fer Hogwarts , " he said . " First o ' September - King 's Cross - it 's all on yer ticket . Any problems with the Dursleys , send me a letter with yer owl , she 'll know where to find me....See yeh soon , Harry . ";Hagrid;;0.125;1488;36
" Er - Uncle Vernon ? ";Uncle;Harry,;0.0;1508;37
" Er - I need to be at King 's Cross tomorrow to - to go to Hogwarts . ";Uncle;Harry,;0.0;1510;37
" Would it be all right if you gave me a lift ? ";Uncle;Harry,;0.285714285714;1512;37
" Thank you . ";Uncle;Harry,;0.0;1515;37
" Funny way to get to a wizards ' school , the train . Magic carpets all got punctures , have they ? ";Harry;Uncle,;0.375;1517;37
" Where is this school , anyway ? ";Uncle;Harry,;0.0;1519;37
" I do n't know , " said Harry , realizing this for the first time .;Harry;Uncle,;0.25;1520;37
" I just take the train from platform nine and three-quarters at eleven o'clock , " he read .;Uncle;Harry,;0.0;1522;37
" Platform what ? ";Uncle;Harry,;0.0;1524;37
" Nine and three-quarters . ";Uncle;Harry,;0.0;1525;37
" Do n't talk rubbish , " said Uncle Vernon . " There is no platform nine and three-quarters . ";Uncle;Harry,;0.0;1526;37
" It 's on my ticket . ";Uncle;Harry,;0.0;1527;37
" Barking , " said Uncle Vernon , " howling mad , the lot of them . You 'll see . You just wait . All right , we 'll take you to King 's Cross . We 're going up to London tomorrow anyway , or I would n't bother . ";Uncle;Harry,;-0.113095238095;1528;37
" Why are you going to London ? ";Uncle;Harry,;0.0;1529;37
" Taking Dudley to the hospital , " growled Uncle Vernon . " Got to have that ruddy tail removed before he goes to Smeltings . ";Uncle;Dudley,;0.0;1531;37
" Well , there you are , boy . Platform nine - platform ten . Your platform should be somewhere in the middle , but they do n't seem to have built it yet , do they ? ";Uncle;;0.0;1540;38
" Have a good term , " said Uncle Vernon with an even nastier smile .;Uncle;;0.475;1543;38
" - packed with Muggles , of course - ";Harry;;0.0;1560;39
" Now , what 's the platform number ? ";Harry;;0.0;1566;39
" Nine and three-quarters ! ";Harry;;0.0;1568;39
piped a small girl , also red-headed , who was holding her hand , " Mom , ca n't I go ... ";Harry;;-0.25;1569;39
" You 're not old enough , Ginny , now be quiet . All right , Percy , you go first . ";Harry;;0.127142857143;1570;39
" Fred , you next , " the plump woman said .;Harry;;0.0;1573;39
" I 'm not Fred , I 'm George , " said the boy . " Honestly , woman , you call yourself our mother ? Ca n't you tell I 'm George ? ";Harry;George,;0.0;1574;39
" Sorry , George , dear . ";Harry;;-0.5;1575;39
" Only joking , I am Fred , " said the boy , and off he went .;Harry;Fred,;0.0;1576;39
" Excuse me , " Harry said to the plump woman .;Harry;;0.0;1580;39
" Hello , dear , " she said . " First time at Hogwarts ? Ron 's new , too . ";Harry;;0.193181818182;1581;39
" Yes , " said Harry . " The thing is - the thing is , I do n't know how to - ";Harry;;0.0;1584;39
" How to get onto the platform ? ";Harry;;0.0;1585;39
" Not to worry , " she said . " All you have to do is walk straight at the barrier between platforms nine and ten . Do n't stop and do n't be scared you 'll crash into it , that 's very important . Best do it at a bit of a run if you 're nervous . Go on , go now before Ron . ";Harry;;0.43;1587;39
" Er - okay , " said Harry .;Harry;;0.5;1588;39
He passed a round-faced boy who was saying , " Gran , I 've lost my toad again . ";Harry;Ron,Percy,again,opposite,;0.0;1603;40
" Oh , Neville , " he heard the old woman sigh .;Ron;Harry,Percy,again,opposite,;0.1;1604;40
" Give us a look , Lee , go on . ";Harry;Ron,Percy,again,opposite,;0.0;1606;40
" Want a hand ? ";Ron;Harry,Percy,again,opposite,;0.0;1611;40
" Yes , please , " Harry panted .;Harry;Ron,Percy,again,opposite,;0.0;1613;40
" Oy , Fred ! C ' mere and help ! ";Ron;Harry,Percy,again,opposite,;-0.625;1614;40
" Thanks , " said Harry , pushing his sweaty hair out of his eyes .;Harry;Ron,Percy,again,opposite,;0.2;1616;40
" What 's that ? ";Ron;Harry,Percy,again,opposite,;0.0;1617;40
" Blimey , " said the other twin . " Are you - ? ";Harry;Ron,Percy,again,opposite,;-0.125;1619;40
" He is , " said the first twin . " Are n't you ? ";Ron;Harry,Percy,again,opposite,;0.25;1620;40
" What ? ";Harry;Ron,Percy,again,opposite,;0.0;1622;40
" Harry Potter . ";Ron;Harry,Percy,again,opposite,;0.0;1624;40
" Oh , him , " said Harry . " I mean , yes , I am . ";Harry;Ron,Percy,again,opposite,;-0.3125;1626;40
" Fred ? George ? Are you there ? ";Ron;Harry,Percy,again,opposite,;0.0;1629;40
" Coming , Mom . ";Harry;Ron,Percy,again,opposite,;0.0;1630;40
" Ron , you 've got something on your nose . ";Ron;Harry,Percy,again,opposite,;0.0;1634;40
" Mom - geroff " He wriggled free .;Harry;Ron,Percy,again,opposite,;0.4;1636;40
" Aaah , has ickle Ronnie got somefink on his nosie ? ";Percy;Ron,;0.0;1637;40
" Shut up , " said Ron .;Ron;Harry,Percy,again,opposite,;0.0;1639;40
" Where 's Percy ? ";Percy;Harry,Ron,again,opposite,;0.0;1640;40
" He 's coming now . ";Harry;Ron,Percy,again,opposite,;0.0;1642;40
" Ca n't stay long , Mother , " he said . " I 'm up front , the prefects have got two compartments to themselves - ";Ron;Harry,Percy,again,opposite,;-0.05;1645;40
" Oh , are you a prefect , Percy ? ";Harry;Ron,Percy,again,opposite,;0.0;1646;40
said one of the twins , with an air of great surprise . " You should have said something , we had no idea . ";Ron;Harry,Percy,again,opposite,;0.8;1647;40
" Hang on , I think I remember him saying something about it , " said the other twin . " Once - ";Harry;Ron,Percy,again,opposite,;-0.125;1648;40
" Or twice - ";Ron;Harry,Percy,again,opposite,;0.0;1649;40
" A minute - ";Harry;Ron,Percy,again,opposite,;0.0;1650;40
" All summer - ";Ron;Harry,Percy,again,opposite,;0.0;1651;40
" Oh , shut up , " said Percy the Prefect .;Percy;Harry,Ron,again,opposite,;0.0;1652;40
" How come Percy gets new robes , anyway ? ";Harry;Percy,;0.136363636364;1653;40
" Because he 's a prefect , " said their mother fondly . " All right , dear , well , have a good term - send me an owl when you get there . ";Percy;Harry,Ron,again,opposite,;0.467857142857;1655;40
" Now , you two - this year , you behave yourselves . If I get one more owl telling me you 've - you 've blown up a toilet or - ";Harry;Ron,Percy,again,opposite,;0.5;1658;40
" Blown up a toilet ? We 've never blown up a toilet . ";Ron;Harry,Percy,again,opposite,;0.0;1659;40
" Great idea though , thanks , Mom . ";Harry;Ron,Percy,again,opposite,;0.5;1660;40
" It 's not funny . And look after Ron . ";Ron;Harry,Percy,again,opposite,;0.25;1661;40
" Do n't worry , ickle Ronniekins is safe with us . ";Harry;Ron,;0.5;1662;40
" Shut up , " said Ron again .;again;Harry,Ron,Percy,opposite,;0.0;1663;40
" Hey , Mom , guess what ? Guess who we just met on the train ? ";Ron;Harry,Percy,again,opposite,;0.0;1665;40
" You know that black-haired boy who was near us in the station ? Know who he is ? ";Harry;Ron,Percy,again,opposite,;0.1;1667;40
" Who ? ";Ron;Harry,Percy,again,opposite,;0.0;1668;40
" Harry Potter ! ";Harry;Ron,Percy,again,opposite,;0.0;1669;40
" Oh , Mom , can I go on the train and see him , Mom , eh please ... ";Ron;Harry,Percy,again,opposite,;0.0;1671;40
" You 've already seen him , Ginny , and the poor boy is n't something you goggle at in a zoo . Is he really , Fred ? How do you know ? ";Harry;Ron,Percy,again,opposite,;-0.2;1672;40
" Asked him . Saw his scar . It 's really there - like lightning . ";Ron;Harry,Percy,again,opposite,;0.0;1673;40
" Poor dear - no wonder he was alone , I wondered . He was ever so polite when he asked how to get onto the platform . ";Harry;Ron,Percy,again,opposite,;-0.4;1674;40
" Never mind that , do you think he remembers what You-Know-Who looks like ? ";Ron;You-Know-Who,;0.0;1675;40
" I forbid you to ask him , Fred . No , do n't you dare . As though he needs reminding of that on his first day at school . ";Harry;Ron,Percy,again,opposite,;0.25;1677;40
" All right , keep your hair on . ";Ron;Harry,Percy,again,opposite,;0.285714285714;1678;40
" Hurry up ! ";Harry;Ron,Percy,again,opposite,;0.0;1680;40
" Do n't , Ginny , we 'll send you loads of owls . ";Ron;Harry,Percy,again,opposite,;0.0;1683;40
" We 'll send you a Hogwarts ' toilet seat . ";Harry;Hogwarts,;0.0;1684;40
" George ! ";Ron;Harry,Percy,again,opposite,;0.0;1685;40
" Only joking , Mom . ";Harry;Ron,Percy,again,opposite,;0.0;1686;40
" Anyone sitting there ? ";Ron;Harry,Percy,again,opposite,;0.0;1694;40
he asked , pointing at the seat opposite Harry . " Everywhere else is full . ";opposite;Harry,Ron,Percy,again,;0.175;1695;40
" Hey , Ron . ";Harry;Ron,Percy,again,opposite,;0.0;1699;40
" Listen , we 're going down the middle of the train - Lee Jordan 's got a giant tarantula down there . ";Percy;Lee,;-0.0777777777778;1701;40
" Right , " mumbled Ron .;Ron;Harry,Percy,again,opposite,;0.285714285714;1702;40
" Harry , " said the other twin , " did we introduce ourselves ? Fred and George Weasley . And this is Ron , our brother . See you later , then . ";Percy;Ron,;-0.0625;1703;40
" Bye , " said Harry and Ron .;Harry;Ron,Percy,again,opposite,;0.0;1704;40
" Are you really Harry Potter ? ";Percy;Harry,;0.0;1706;40
" Oh - well , I thought it might be one of Fred and George 's jokes , " said Ron . " And have you really got - you know ... ";Ron;Harry,Percy,again,opposite,;0.0;1709;40
" So that 's where You-Know-Who - ? ";Percy;Harry,Ron,again,opposite,;0.0;1713;40
" Yes , " said Harry , " but I ca n't remember it . ";Harry;Ron,Percy,again,opposite,;0.0;1714;40
" Nothing ? ";Ron;Harry,Percy,again,opposite,;0.0;1715;40
" Well - I remember a lot of green light , but nothing else . ";Harry;Ron,Percy,again,opposite,;0.1;1717;40
" Wow , " said Ron .;Ron;Harry,Percy,again,opposite,;0.1;1718;40
" Are all your family wizards ? ";Harry;Ron,Percy,again,opposite,;0.0;1720;40
" Er - Yes , I think so , " said Ron . " I think Mom 's got a second cousin who 's an accountant , but we never talk about him . ";Ron;Harry,Percy,again,opposite,;0.0;1722;40
" So you must know loads of magic already . ";Harry;Ron,Percy,again,opposite,;0.5;1723;40
" I heard you went to live with Muggles , " said Ron . " What are they like ? ";Ron;Harry,Percy,again,opposite,;0.136363636364;1725;40
" Horrible - well , not all of them . My aunt and uncle and cousin are , though . Wish I'd had three wizard brothers . ";Harry;I'd,;-1.0;1726;40
" Five , " said Ron .;Ron;Harry,Percy,again,opposite,;0.0;1727;40
For some reason , he was looking gloomy . " I 'm the sixth in our family to go to Hogwarts . You could say I 've got a lot to live up to . Bill and Charlie have already left - Bill was head boy and Charlie was captain of Quidditch . Now Percy 's a prefect . Fred and George mess around a lot , but they still get really good marks and everyone thinks they 're really funny . Everyone expects me to do as well as the others , but if I do , it 's no big deal , because they did it first . You never get anything new , either , with five brothers . I 've got Bill 's old robes , Charlie 's old wand , and Percy 's old rat . ";Harry;Charlie,Bill,;0.232272727273;1728;40
" His name 's Scabbers and he 's useless , he hardly ever wakes up . Percy got an owl from my dad for being made a prefect , but they could n't aff - I mean , I got Scabbers instead . ";Ron;Percy,Scabbers,;-0.40625;1730;40
" ...and until Hagrid told me , I did n't know anything about being a wizard or about my parents or Voldemort - ";Percy;Hagrid,;0.0;1736;40
" What ? ";Harry;Ron,Percy,again,opposite,;0.0;1738;40
" You said You-Know-Who 's name ! ";Percy;You-Know-Who,;0.0;1740;40
said Ron , sounding both shocked and impressed . " I'd have thought you , of all people - ";Ron;I'd,;0.15;1741;40
" I 'm not trying to be brave or anything , saying the name , " said Harry , " I just never knew you should n't . See what I mean ? I 've got loads to learn....I bet , " he added , voicing for the first time something that had been worrying him a lot lately , " I bet I 'm the worst in the class . ";Harry;Ron,Percy,again,opposite,;-0.065625;1742;40
" You wo n't be . There 's loads of people who come from Muggle families and they learn quick enough . ";Ron;Harry,Percy,again,opposite,;0.166666666667;1743;40
Around half past twelve there was a great clattering outside in the corridor and a smiling , dimpled woman slid back their door and said , " Anything off the cart , dears ? ";Harry;Ron,Percy,again,opposite,;0.0766666666667;1747;40
" Hungry , are you ? ";Ron;Harry,Percy,again,opposite,;0.0;1755;40
" Starving , " said Harry , taking a large bite out of a pumpkin pasty .;Harry;Ron,Percy,again,opposite,;0.214285714286;1756;40
He pulled one of them apart and said , " She always forgets I do n't like corned beef . . ";Ron;Harry,Percy,again,opposite,;0.0;1759;40
" Swap you for one of these , " said Harry , holding up a pasty . " Go on - ";Harry;Ron,Percy,again,opposite,;0.0;1760;40
" You do n't want this , it 's all dry , " said Ron . " She has n't got much time , " he added quickly , " you know , with five of us . ";Ron;Harry,Percy,again,opposite,;0.0166666666667;1761;40
" Go on , have a pasty , " said Harry , who had never had anything to share before or , indeed , anyone to share it with .;Harry;Ron,Percy,again,opposite,;0.0;1762;40
" What are these ? ";Ron;Harry,Percy,again,opposite,;0.0;1764;40
Harry asked Ron , holding up a pack of Chocolate Frogs . " They 're not really frogs , are they ? ";Harry;Ron,Percy,again,opposite,;0.0;1765;40
" No , " said Ron . " But see what the card is . I 'm missing Agrippa . ";Ron;Agrippa,;-0.2;1767;40
" What ? ";Percy;Harry,Ron,again,opposite,;0.0;1768;40
" Oh , of course , you would n't know - Chocolate Frogs have cards , inside them , you know , to collect - famous witches and wizards . I 've got about five hundred , but I have n't got Agrippa or Ptolemy . ";Harry;Agrippa,;0.5;1769;40
" So this is Dumbledore ! ";Ron;Dumbledore,;0.0;1774;40
" Do n't tell me you'd never heard of Dumbledore ! ";Harry;Ron,Percy,again,opposite,;0.0;1776;40
said Ron . " Can I have a frog ? I might get Agrippa - thanks - ";Ron;Agrippa,;0.2;1777;40
" He 's gone ! ";Harry;Ron,boy,;0.0;1787;41
" Well , you ca n't expect him to hang around all day , " said Ron . " He 'll be back . No , I 've got Morgana again and I 've got about six of her...do you want it ? You can start collecting . ";Ron;Harry,boy,;0.0;1788;41
" Help yourself , " said Harry . " But in , you know , the Muggle world , people just stay put in photos . ";Harry;Ron,boy,;0.0;1790;41
" Do they ? What , they do n't move at all ? ";boy;Ron,Harry,;0.0;1791;41
Ron sounded amazed . " Weird ! ";Ron;Harry,boy,;-0.625;1792;41
" You want to be careful with those , " Ron warned Harry . " When they say every flavor , they mean every flavor - you know , you get all the ordinary ones like chocolate and peppermint and marmalade , but then you can get spinach and liver and tripe .

" Charlie 's in Romania studying dragons , and Bill 's in Africa doing something for Gringotts , " said Ron . " Did you hear about Gringotts ?

Ron looked dumbfounded .

" I'd be careful if I were you , Potter , " he said slowly . " Unless you 're a bit politer you 'll go the same way as your parents . They did n't know what was good for them , either .

" Oh , you 're going to fight us , are you ? ";Harry;Scabbers,Ron,Hermione,Goyle,darkly,Hagrid,;0.0;1891;43

" You 've met Malfoy before ? ";Ron;Malfoy,;0.0;1903;43
" I 've heard of his family , " said Ron darkly . " They were some of the first to come back to our side after You-Know-Who disappeared . Said they'd been bewitched . My dad does n't believe it .

" Scabbers has been fighting , not us , " said Ron , scowling at her . " Would you mind leaving while we change ? ";Ron;Scabbers,;0.0;1908;43
" All right - I only came in here because people outside are behaving very childishly , racing up and down the corridors , " said Hermione in a sniffy voice . " And you 've got dirt on your nose , by the way , did you know ? ";Hermione;Scabbers,Ron,Harry,Goyle,darkly,Hagrid,;0.0660317460317;1909;43

" Welcome to Hogwarts , " said Professor McGonagall . " The start-of-term banquet will begin shortly , but before you take your seats in the Great Hall , you will be sorted into your houses .

" The four houses are called Gryffindor , Hufflepuff , Ravenclaw , and Slytherin . Each house has its own noble history and each has produced outstanding witches and wizards .

Sometimes , Harry noticed , the hat shouted out the house at once , but at others it took a little while to decide .

On Harry 's other side , Percy Weasley and Hermione were talking about lessons ( " I do hope they start right away , there 's so much to learn , I 'm particularly interested in Transfiguration , you know , turning something into something else , of course , it 's supposed to be very difficult - " ; " You 'll be starting small , just matches into needles and that sort of thing - " ) .;Weasley;Ron,Harry,pompously,airily,Seamus,Nick,Neville,Dumbledore,Percy,;-0.055612244898;2195;50

" Oh , you know Quirrell already , do you ? No wonder he 's looking so nervous , that 's Professor Snape . He teaches Potions , but he does n't want to - everyone knows he 's after Quirrell 's job . Knows an awful lot about the Dark Arts , Snape . ";Ron;already,Professor,;-0.575;2211;50
" Ahem - just a few more words now that we are all fed and watered . I have a few start-of-term notices to give you .;Dumbledore;Ron,Harry,pompously,airily,Seamus,Nick,Neville,Weasley,Percy,;0.0333333333333;2215;50

" I have also been asked by Mr. Filch , the caretaker , to remind you all that no magic should be used between classes in the corridors .;Dumbledore;Ron,Harry,pompously,airily,Seamus,Nick,Neville,Weasley,Percy,;0.5;2218;50
" Quidditch trials will be held in the second week of the term . Anyone interested in playing for their house teams should contact Madam Hooch .;Ron;Hooch,;0.125;2219;50
" And finally , I must tell you that this year , the third-floor corridor on the right-hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a very painful death . ";Harry;Ron,pompously,airily,Seamus,Nick,Neville,Weasley,Dumbledore,Percy,;-0.91;2220;50

" Must be , " said Percy , frowning at Dumbledore . " It 's odd , because he usually gives us a reason why we 're not allowed to go somewhere - the forest 's full of dangerous beasts , everyone knows that .

" Did you see his scar ? ";Harry;;0.0;2293;53
He would drop wastepaper baskets on your head , pull rugs from under your feet , pelt you with bits of chalk , or sneak up behind you , invisible , grab your nose , and screech , " GOT YOUR CONK ! ";Filch;;-0.5;2304;54
" Transfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous magic you will learn at Hogwarts , " she said . " Anyone messing around in my class will leave and not come back . You have been warned . ";Harry;Transfiguration,;0.02;2325;55
" What have we got today ? ";Ron;Harry,;0.0;2339;56
" Double Potions with the Slytherins , " said Ron . " Snape 's Head of Slytherin House . They say he always favors them - we 'll be able to see if it 's true . ";Ron;Harry,;0.283333333333;2341;56

" You are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of potionmaking , " he began .;Hagrid;Harry,Snape,suddenly,Hermione,Ron,;-0.0416666666667;2371;57
He spoke in barely more than a whisper , but they caught every word - like Professor McGonagall , Snape had the gift of keeping a class silent without effort . " As there is little foolish wand-waving here , many of you will hardly believe this is magic . I do n't expect you will really understand the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with its shimmering fumes , the delicate power of liquids that creep through human veins , bewitching the mind , ensnaring the senses....I can teach you how to bottle fame , brew glory , even stopper death - if you are n't as big a bunch of dunderheads as I usually have to teach .

" I do n't know , " said Harry quietly . " I think Hermione does , though , why do n't you try her ? ";Harry;Hermione,;0.0;2394;57
" Sit down , " he snapped at Hermione . " For your information , Potter , asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful it is known as the Draught of Living Death . A bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of a goat and it will save you from most poisons . As for monkshood and wolfsbane , they are the same plant , which also goes by the name of aconite . Well ? Why are n't you all copying that down ? ";Hermione;Harry,Snape,suddenly,Ron,Hagrid,;0.0977777777778;2397;57
Over the noise , Snape said , " And a point will be taken from Gryffindor House for your cheek , Potter . ";Snape;Harry,suddenly,Hermione,Ron,Hagrid,;0.0;2399;57
" Idiot boy ! ";Harry;Snape,suddenly,Hermione,Ron,Hagrid,;0.0;2406;57

" Take him up to the hospital wing , " Snape spat at Seamus .;Snape;Harry,suddenly,Hermione,Ron,Hagrid,;0.0;2409;57
" You - Potter - why did n't you tell him not to add the quills ? Thought he'd make you look good if he got it wrong , did you ? That 's another point you 've lost for Gryffindor . ";Harry;Snape,suddenly,Hermione,Ron,Hagrid,;0.075;2411;57
" Do n't push it , " he muttered , " I 've heard Snape can turn very nasty . ";Hagrid;Snape,;-1.0;2413;57
" Cheer up , " said Ron , " Snape 's always taking points off Fred and George . Can I come and meet Hagrid with you ? ";Ron;Hagrid,;0.0;2416;57

" An ' as fer that cat , Mrs. Norris , I'd like ter introduce her to Fang sometime . D'yeh know , every time I go up ter the school , she follows me everywhere ? Ca n't get rid of her - Filch puts her up to it . ";Snape;I'd,Filch,;0.0;2436;57

Catching the look on Harry 's face , he added quickly , " But people only die in proper duels , you know , with real wizards . The most you and Malfoy 'll be able to do is send sparks at each other .

Ron had spent all evening giving him advice such as " If he tries to curse you , you'd better dodge it , because I ca n't remember how to block them . ";Ron;Hermione,loudly,Harry,Neville,;0.133333333333;2675;65
" Half-past eleven , " Ron muttered at last , " we'd better go . ";Ron;Hermione,loudly,Harry,Neville,;0.25;2679;65
They had almost reached the portrait hole when a voice spoke from the chair nearest them , " I ca n't believe you 're going to do this , Harry . ";Neville;Ron,Hermione,loudly,Harry,;0.0;2682;65
" You ! ";Hermione;Ron,loudly,Harry,Neville,;0.0;2685;65
said Ron furiously . " Go back to bed ! ";Ron;Hermione,loudly,Harry,Neville,;0.0;2686;65
" I almost told your brother , " Hermione snapped , " Percy - he 's a prefect , he'd put a stop to this . ";Hermione;Ron,loudly,Harry,Neville,;0.0;2687;65
" Come on , " he said to Ron .;Ron;Hermione,loudly,Harry,Neville,;0.0;2689;65
" Do n't you care about Gryffindor , do you only care about yourselves , I do n't want Slytherin to win the house cup , and you 'll lose all the points I got from Professor McGonagall for knowing about Switching Spells . ";Neville;Slytherin,;0.4;2693;65
" Go away . ";Ron;Hermione,loudly,Harry,Neville,;0.0;2694;65
" All right , but I warned you , you just remember what I said when you 're on the train home tomorrow , you 're so - ";Hermione;Ron,loudly,Harry,Neville,;0.285714285714;2695;65
" Now what am I going to do ? ";Neville;Ron,Hermione,loudly,Harry,;0.0;2699;65
" That 's your problem , " said Ron . " We 've got to go , we 're going to be late . ";Ron;Hermione,loudly,Harry,Neville,;-0.3;2701;65
" I 'm coming with you , " she said .;Neville;Ron,Hermione,loudly,Harry,;0.0;2703;65
" You are not . ";Ron;Hermione,loudly,Harry,Neville,;0.0;2704;65
" D'you think I 'm going to stand out here and wait for Filch to catch me ? If he finds all three of us I 'll tell him the truth , that I was trying to stop you , and you can back me up . ";Neville;Ron,Hermione,loudly,Harry,;0.0;2705;65
" You 've got some nerve - " said Ron loudly .;loudly;Ron,Hermione,Harry,Neville,;0.0;2706;65
" Shut up , both of you ! ";Ron;Hermione,loudly,Harry,Neville,;0.0;2707;65
I heard something . ";Harry;Ron,Hermione,loudly,Neville,;0.0;2709;65
" Mrs. Norris ? ";Ron;Hermione,loudly,Harry,Neville,;0.0;2711;65
" Thank goodness you found me ! I 've been out here for hours , I could n't remember the new password to get in to bed . ";Neville;Ron,Hermione,loudly,Harry,;0.136363636364;2716;65
" Keep your voice down , Neville . The password 's ' Pig snout ' but it wo n't help you now , the Fat Lady 's gone off somewhere . ";Ron;Hermione,loudly,Harry,Neville,;-0.155555555556;2717;65
" How 's your arm ? ";Hermione;Ron,loudly,Harry,Neville,;0.0;2718;65
" Fine , " said Neville , showing them . " Madam Pomfrey mended it in about a minute . ";Neville;Pomfrey,;0.416666666667;2720;65
" Good - well , look , Neville , we 've got to be somewhere , we 'll see you later - ";Ron;Hermione,loudly,Harry,Neville,;0.325;2721;65
" Do n't leave me ! ";Hermione;Ron,loudly,Harry,Neville,;0.0;2722;65
said Neville , scrambling to his feet , " I do n't want to stay here alone , the Bloody Baron 's been past twice already . ";Neville;Ron,Hermione,loudly,Harry,;-0.525;2723;65
" If either of you get us caught , I 'll never rest until I 've learned that Curse of the Bogies Quirrell told us about , and used it on you . ";Ron;Bogies,;0.0;2725;65
" He 's late , maybe he 's chickened out , " Ron whispered .;Ron;Neville,Harry,Hermione,Filch,;-0.3;2736;66
" Sniff around , my sweet , they might be lurking in a corner . ";Harry;Ron,Neville,Hermione,Filch,;0.35;2739;66
" They 're in here somewhere , " they heard him mutter , " probably hiding . ";Neville;Ron,Harry,Hermione,Filch,;0.0;2743;66
" This way ! ";Ron;Neville,Harry,Hermione,Filch,;0.0;2744;66
" RUN ! ";Neville;Ron,Harry,Hermione,Filch,;0.0;2749;66
" I think we 've lost him , " Harry panted , leaning against the cold wall and wiping his forehead .;Harry;Ron,Neville,Hermione,Filch,;-0.6;2751;66
I - told - you , " Hermione gasped , clutching at the stitch in her chest , " I - told - you . ";Neville;Hermione,;0.0;2753;66
" We 've got to get back to Gryffindor tower , " said Ron , " quickly as possible . ";Ron;Neville,Harry,Hermione,Filch,;0.0;2754;66
" Malfoy tricked you , " Hermione said to Harry . " You realize that , do n't you ? He was never going to meet you - Filch knew someone was going to be in the trophy room , Malfoy must have tipped him off . ";Hermione;Malfoy,Filch,;0.0;2755;66
" Let 's go . ";Ron;Neville,Harry,Hermione,Filch,;0.0;2757;66
" Shut up , Peeves - please - you 'll get us thrown out . ";Harry;Ron,Neville,Hermione,Filch,;0.0;2762;66
" Wandering around at midnight , Ickle Firsties ? Tut , tut , tut . Naughty , naughty , you 'll get caughty . ";Ron;Neville,Harry,Hermione,Filch,;-0.15;2764;66
" Not if you do n't give us away , Peeves , please . ";Harry;Ron,Neville,Hermione,Filch,;0.0;2765;66
" Should tell Filch , I should , " said Peeves in a saintly voice , but his eyes glittered wickedly . " It 's for your own good , you know . ";Neville;Filch,;0.625;2766;66
" Get out of the way , " snapped Ron , taking a swipe at Peeves this was a big mistake .;Ron;Neville,Harry,Hermione,Filch,;0.0;2767;66
" STUDENTS OUT OF BED ! ";Harry;Ron,Neville,Hermione,Filch,;0.0;2768;66
Peeves bellowed , " STUDENTS OUT OF BED DOWN THE CHARMS CORRIDOR ! ";Ron;Neville,Harry,Hermione,Filch,;-0.194444444444;2769;66
" This is it ! ";Harry;Ron,Neville,Hermione,Filch,;0.0;2771;66
Ron moaned , as they pushed helplessly at the door , " We 're done for ! This is the end ! ";Ron;Neville,Harry,Hermione,Filch,;0.0;2772;66
" Oh , move over , " Hermione snarled .;Hermione;Ron,Neville,Harry,Filch,;0.0;2774;66
She grabbed Harry 's wand , tapped the lock , and whispered , " Alohomora ! ";Harry;Ron,Neville,Hermione,Filch,;0.0;2775;66
" Which way did they go , Peeves ? ";Ron;Neville,Harry,Hermione,Filch,;0.0;2777;66
Filch was saying . " Quick , tell me . ";Filch;Ron,Neville,Harry,Hermione,;0.333333333333;2778;66
" Say ' please . ' ";Ron;Neville,Harry,Hermione,Filch,;0.0;2779;66
" Do n't mess with me , Peeves , now where did they go ? ";Harry;Ron,Neville,Hermione,Filch,;0.0;2780;66
" Sha n't say nothing if you do n't say please , " said Peeves in his annoying singsong voice .;Ron;Neville,Harry,Hermione,Filch,;-0.8;2781;66
" All right - please . ";Harry;Ron,Neville,Hermione,Filch,;0.285714285714;2782;66
" NOTHING ! Ha haaa ! Told you I would n't say nothing if you did n't say please ! Ha ha ! Haaaaaa ! ";Ron;Neville,Harry,Hermione,Filch,;0.0;2783;66
" He thinks this door is locked , " Harry whispered . " I think we 'll be okay - get off , Neville ! ";Harry;Ron,Neville,Hermione,Filch,;0.625;2785;66
For Neville had been tugging on the sleeve of Harry 's bathrobe for the last minute . " What ? ";Neville;Ron,Harry,Hermione,Filch,;0.0;2786;66
" Where on earth have you all been ? ";Ron;earth,;0.0;2801;67
" Never mind that - pig snout , pig snout , " panted Harry , and the portrait swung forward .;Harry;Ron,Hermione,;0.0;2803;67
" What do they think they 're doing , keeping a thing like that locked up in a school ? ";Hermione;Harry,Ron,;0.0;2807;67
said Ron finally . " If any dog needs exercise , that one does . ";Ron;Harry,Hermione,;0.0;2808;67
Hermione had got both her breath and her bad temper back again . " You do n't use your eyes , any of you , do you ? ";Hermione;Harry,Ron,;-0.308333333333;2809;67
she snapped . " Did n't you see what it was standing on .;Ron;Harry,Hermione,;0.0;2810;67
" The floor ? ";Hermione;Harry,Ron,;0.0;2811;67
Harry suggested . " I was n't looking at its feet , I was too busy with its heads . ";Harry;Ron,Hermione,;0.1;2812;67
" No , not the floor . It was standing on a trapdoor . It 's obviously guarding something . ";Hermione;Harry,Ron,;0.0;2813;67
" I hope you 're pleased with yourselves . We could all have been killed - or worse , expelled . Now , if you do n't mind , I 'm going to bed . ";Ron;Harry,Hermione,;0.05;2815;67
" No , we do n't mind , " he said . " You'd think we dragged her along , would n't you .;Harry;You'd,;0.0;2817;67
" It 's either really valuable or really dangerous , " said Ron .;Ron;Harry,;-0.6;2830;68
" Or both , " said Harry .;Harry;Ron,;0.0;2831;68
" A Nimbus Two Thousand ! ";Harry;Ron,Malfoy,Professor,;0.0;2849;69
Ron moaned enviously . " I 've never even touched one . ";Ron;Harry,Malfoy,Professor,;0.0;2850;69
" That 's a broomstick , " he said , throwing it back to Harry with a mixture of jealousy and spite on his face . " You 'll be in for it this time , Potter , first years are n't allowed them . ";Harry;Ron,Malfoy,Professor,;0.125;2853;69
" It 's not any old broomstick , " he said , " it 's a Nimbus Two Thousand . What did you say you 've got at home , Malfoy , a Comet Two Sixty ? ";Malfoy;Nimbus,;0.1;2855;69
Ron grinned at Harry . " Comets look flashy , but they 're not in the same league as the Nimbus . ";Ron;Harry,Malfoy,Professor,;-0.25;2856;69
" What would you know about it , Weasley , you could n't afford half the handle , " Malfoy snapped back . " I suppose you and your brothers have to save up twig by twig . ";Malfoy;Ron,Harry,Professor,;-0.0833333333333;2857;69
" Not arguing , I hope , boys ? ";Ron;Harry,Malfoy,Professor,;0.0;2859;69
" Potter 's been sent a broomstick , Professor , " said Malfoy quickly .;Malfoy;Ron,Harry,Professor,;0.0;2861;69
" Yes , yes , that 's right , " said Professor Flitwick , beaming at Harry . " Professor McGonagall told me all about the special circumstances , Potter . And what model is it ? ";Professor;Professor,;0.321428571429;2862;69
" A Nimbus Two Thousand , it is , " said Harry , fighting not to laugh at the look of horror on Malfoy 's face . " And it 's really thanks to Malfoy here that I 've got it , " he added .;Harry;Ron,Malfoy,Professor,;0.166666666667;2863;69
" Well , it 's true , " Harry chortled as they reached the top of the marble staircase , " If he had n't stolen Neville 's Remembrall I would n't be on the team ... ";Harry;Neville,;0.425;2865;69
" So I suppose you think that 's a reward for breaking rules ? ";Ron;Harry,Malfoy,Professor,;0.0;2866;69
" I thought you were n't speaking to us ? ";Harry;Ron,Malfoy,Professor,;0.0;2869;69
" Yes , do n't stop now , " said Ron , " it 's doing us so much good . ";Ron;Harry,Malfoy,Professor,;0.65;2871;69
" Wow , " Ron sighed , as the broomstick rolled onto Harry 's bedspread .;Ron;Harry,Malfoy,Professor,;0.1;2876;69
" Hey , Potter , come down ! ";Wood;Harry,;-0.194444444444;2887;70
" Very nice , " said Wood , his eyes glinting . " I see what McGonagall meant...you really are a natural . I 'm just going to teach you the rules this evening , then you 'll be joining team practice three times a week . ";Wood;Harry,;0.293333333333;2891;70
" Right , " said Wood . " Now , Quidditch is easy enough to understand , even if it 's not too easy to play . There are seven players on each side . Three of them are called Chasers . ";Wood;Quidditch,;0.288095238095;2894;70
" Three Chasers , " Harry repeated , as Wood took out a bright red ball about the size of a soccer ball .;Harry;Wood,;0.35;2895;70
" This ball 's called the Quaffle , " said Wood . " The Chasers throw the Quaffle to each other and try and get it through one of the hoops to score a goal . Ten points every time the Quaffle goes through one of the hoops . Follow me ? ";Wood;Quaffle,;-0.0625;2896;70
" The Chasers throw the Quaffle and put it through the hoops to score , " Harry recited . " So - that 's sort of like basketball on broomsticks with six hoops , is n't it ? ";Harry;Quaffle,;0.0;2897;70
" What 's basketball ? ";Wood;Harry,;0.0;2898;70
" Never mind , " said Harry quickly .;Harry;Wood,;0.0;2900;70
" Now , there 's another player on each side who 's called the Keeper - I 'm Keeper for Gryffindor . I have to fly around our hoops and stop the other team from scoring . ";Wood;Harry,;0.3375;2901;70
" Three Chasers , one Keeper , " said Harry , who was determined to remember it all . " And they play with the Quaffle . Okay , got that . So what are they for ? ";Harry;Wood,;0.5;2902;70
" I 'll show you now , " said Wood . " Take this . ";Wood;Harry,;0.0;2904;70
" I 'm going to show you what the Bludgers do , " Wood said . " These two are the Bludgers . ";Wood;Bludgers,;0.0;2906;70
" Stand back , " Wood warned Harry .;Wood;Harry,;0.0;2909;70
" See ? ";Wood;Harry,;0.0;2913;70
Wood panted , forcing the struggling Bludger back into the crate and strapping it down safely . " The Bludgers rocket around , trying to knock players off their brooms . That 's why you have two Beaters on each team - the Weasley twins are ours - it 's their job to protect their side from the Bludgers and try and knock them toward the other team . So - think you 've got all that ? ";Wood;Beaters,;-0.0935185185185;2914;70
" Three Chasers try and score with the Quaffle ; the Keeper guards the goal posts ; the Beaters keep the Bludgers away from their team , " Harry reeled off .;Harry;Wood,;0.0;2915;70
" Very good , " said Wood .;Wood;Harry,;0.845;2916;70
" Er - have the Bludgers ever killed anyone ? ";Wood;Bludgers,;0.0;2917;70
" Never at Hogwarts . We 've had a couple of broken jaws but nothing worse than that . Now , the last member of the team is the Seeker . That 's you . And you do n't have to worry about the Quaffle or the Bludgers - ";Harry;Wood,;-0.266666666667;2919;70
" - unless they crack my head open . ";Wood;Harry,;0.0;2920;70
" Do n't worry , the Weasleys are more than a match for the Bludgers - I mean , they 're like a pair of human Bludgers themselves . ";Wood;Weasley,;0.0625;2921;70
" This , " said Wood , " is the Golden Snitch , and it 's the most important ball of the lot . It 's very hard to catch because it 's so fast and difficult to see . It 's the Seeker 's job to catch it . You 've got to weave in and out of the Chasers , Beaters , Bludgers , and Quaffle to get it before the other team 's Seeker , because whichever Seeker catches the Snitch wins his team an extra hundred and fifty points , so they nearly always win . That 's why Seekers get fouled so much . A game of Quidditch only ends when the Snitch is caught , so it can go on for ages - I think the record is three months , they had to keep bringing on substitutes so the players could get some sleep .;Wood;Snitch,only,;0.0919871794872;2925;70
" Well , that 's it any questions ? ";Wood;Harry,;0.0;2926;70
" We wo n't practice with the Snitch yet , " said Wood , carefully shutting it back inside the crate , " it 's too dark , we might lose it . Let 's try you out with a few of these . ";Wood;Harry,;-0.116666666667;2929;70
" That Quidditch Cup 'll have our name on it this year , " said Wood happily as they trudged back up to the castle . " I would n't be surprised if you turn out better than Charlie Weasley , and he could have played for England if he had n't gone off chasing dragons . ";Wood;Quidditch,;0.2;2933;70
" Now , do n't forget that nice wrist movement we 've been practicing ! ";Harry;Professor,Ron,Hermione,Dumbledore,Percy,Hufflepuff,;0.75;2945;71
squeaked Professor Flitwick , perched on top of his pile of books as usual . " Swish and flick , remember , swish and flick . And saying the magic words properly is very important , too - never forget Wizard Baruffio , who said ' s ' instead of ' f ' and found himself on the floor with a buffalo on his chest . ";Professor;Wizard,;0.3175;2946;71
" Wingardium Leviosa ! ";Ron;Professor,Harry,Hermione,Dumbledore,Percy,Hufflepuff,;0.0;2951;71
" You 're saying it wrong , " Harry heard Hermione snap . " It 's Wing-gar-dium Levi-o-sa , make the ' gar ' nice and long . ";Harry;Levi-o-sa,;0.0166666666667;2953;71
" You do it , then , if you 're so clever , " Ron snarled .;Ron;Professor,Harry,Hermione,Dumbledore,Percy,Hufflepuff,;0.166666666667;2954;71
Hermione rolled up the sleeves of her gown , flicked her wand , and said , " Wingardium Leviosa ! ";Hermione;Professor,Harry,Ron,Dumbledore,Percy,Hufflepuff,;0.0;2955;71
" Oh , well done ! ";Harry;Professor,Ron,Hermione,Dumbledore,Percy,Hufflepuff,;0.0;2957;71
cried Professor Flitwick , clapping . " Everyone see here , Miss Granger 's done it ! ";Professor;Harry,Ron,Hermione,Dumbledore,Percy,Hufflepuff,;0.0;2958;71
" It 's no wonder no one can stand her , " he said to Harry as they pushed their way into the crowded corridor , " she 's a nightmare , honestly . ";Harry;Professor,Ron,Hermione,Dumbledore,Percy,Hufflepuff,;0.0;2960;71
" I think she heard you . ";Ron;Professor,Harry,Hermione,Dumbledore,Percy,Hufflepuff,;0.0;2964;71
" So ? ";Harry;Professor,Ron,Hermione,Dumbledore,Percy,Hufflepuff,;0.0;2965;71
said Ron , but he looked a bit uncomfortable . " She must 've noticed she 's got no friends . ";Ron;Professor,Harry,Hermione,Dumbledore,Percy,Hufflepuff,;-0.5;2966;71
Everyone stared as he reached Professor Dumbledore 's chair , slumped against the table , and gasped , " Troll - in the dungeons - thought you ought to know . ";Dumbledore;Professor,Harry,Ron,Hermione,Percy,Hufflepuff,;0.0;2973;71
" Prefects , " he rumbled , " lead your Houses back to the dormitories immediately ! ";Harry;Professor,Ron,Hermione,Dumbledore,Percy,Hufflepuff,;0.0;2977;71
" Follow me ! Stick together , first years ! No need to fear the troll if you follow my orders ! Stay close behind me , now . Make way , first years coming through ! Excuse me , I 'm a prefect ! ";Percy;Professor,Harry,Ron,Hermione,Dumbledore,Hufflepuff,;0.125325520833;2979;71
" How could a troll get in ? ";Harry;Professor,Ron,Hermione,Dumbledore,Percy,Hufflepuff,;0.0;2980;71
" Do n't ask me , they 're supposed to be really stupid , " said Ron . " Maybe Peeves let it in for a Halloween joke . ";Ron;Professor,Harry,Hermione,Dumbledore,Percy,Hufflepuff,;-1.0;2982;71
" I 've just thought - Hermione . ";Harry;Professor,Ron,Hermione,Dumbledore,Percy,Hufflepuff,;0.0;2985;71
" What about her ? ";Ron;Professor,Harry,Hermione,Dumbledore,Percy,Hufflepuff,;0.0;2986;71
" She does n't know about the troll . ";Harry;Professor,Ron,Hermione,Dumbledore,Percy,Hufflepuff,;0.0;2987;71
" Oh , all right , " he snapped . " But Percy'd better not see us . ";Hufflepuff;Percy,;0.392857142857;2989;71
" Percy ! ";Harry;Professor,Ron,Hermione,Dumbledore,Percy,Hufflepuff,;0.0;2992;71
" What 's he doing ? ";Ron;Professor,Harry,Hermione,Dumbledore,Percy,Hufflepuff,;0.0;2996;71
Harry whispered . " Why is n't he down in the dungeons with the rest of the teachers ? ";Harry;Professor,Ron,Hermione,Dumbledore,Percy,Hufflepuff,;-0.155555555556;2997;71
" Search me . ";Ron;Professor,Harry,Hermione,Dumbledore,Percy,Hufflepuff,;0.0;2998;71
" He 's heading for the third floor , " Harry said , but Ron held up his hand .;Harry;Professor,Ron,Hermione,Dumbledore,Percy,Hufflepuff,;0.0;3000;71
" Can you smell something ? ";Ron;Professor,Harry,Hermione,Dumbledore,Percy,Hufflepuff,;0.0;3001;71
" The keys in the lock , " Harry muttered . " We could lock it in . ";Harry;Ron,Hermione,;0.0;3013;72
" Good idea , " said Ron nervously .;Ron;Harry,Hermione,;0.65;3014;72
" Yes ! ";Harry;Ron,Hermione,;0.0;3017;72
" Oh , no , " said Ron , pale as the Bloody Baron .;Ron;Harry,Hermione,;-0.8;3019;72
" It 's the girls ' bathroom ! ";Hermione;Harry,Ron,;0.0;3020;72
" Hermione ! ";Harry;Ron,Hermione,;0.0;3022;72
" Confuse it ! ";Hermione;Harry,Ron,;0.0;3029;72
" Oy , pea-brain ! ";Ron;Harry,Hermione,;0.0;3035;72
" Come on , run , run ! ";Harry;Ron,Hermione,;0.0;3038;72
Hermione had sunk to the floor in fright ; Ron pulled out his own wand - not knowing what he was going to do he heard himself cry the first spell that came into his head : " Wingardium Leviosa ! ";Hermione;Harry,Ron,;0.53125;3045;72
" Is it - dead ? ";Ron;Harry,Hermione,;-0.2;3052;72
" I do n't think so , " said Harry , I think it 's just been knocked out . ";Harry;Ron,Hermione,;0.0;3053;72
" Urgh - troll boogers . ";Ron;Harry,Hermione,;0.0;3056;72
" What on earth were you thinking of ? ";Professor;earth,;0.0;3067;73
Harry looked at Ron , who was still standing with his wand in the air . " You 're lucky you were n't killed . Why are n't you in your dormitory ? ";Harry;Hermione,Professor,Ron,;0.333333333333;3069;73
" Please , Professor McGonagall - they were looking for me . ";Professor;Harry,Hermione,Ron,;0.0;3074;73
" Miss Granger ! ";Hermione;Harry,Professor,Ron,;0.0;3075;73
" I went looking for the troll because I - I thought I could deal with it on my own - you know , because I 've read all about them . ";Professor;Harry,Hermione,Ron,;0.6;3077;73
" If they had n't found me , I'd be dead now . Harry stuck his wand up its nose and Ron knocked it out with its own club . They did n't have time to come and fetch anyone . It was about to finish me off when they arrived . ";Harry;I'd,Ron,;0.2;3080;73
" Well - in that case ... ";Hermione;Harry,Professor,Ron,;0.0;3082;73
said Professor McGonagall , staring at the three of them , " Miss Granger , you foolish girl , how could you think of tackling a mountain troll on your own ? ";Professor;Harry,Hermione,Ron,;0.6;3083;73
" Miss Granger , five points will be taken from Gryffindor for this , " said Professor McGonagall . " I 'm very disappointed in you . If you 're not hurt at all , you'd better get off to Gryffindor tower . Students are finishing the feast in their houses . ";Professor;Harry,Hermione,Ron,;-0.2375;3088;73
" Well , I still say you were lucky , but not many first years could have taken on a full-grown mountain troll . You each win Gryffindor five points . Professor Dumbledore will be informed of this . You may go . ";Harry;Dumbledore,;0.470833333333;3091;73
" We should have gotten more than ten points , " Ron grumbled .;Ron;Harry,Hermione,Professor,;0.25;3094;73
" Five , you mean , once she 's taken off Hermione ' s. ";Harry;Hermione,Professor,Ron,;-0.3125;3095;73
" Good of her to get us out of trouble like that , " Ron admitted . " Mind you , we did save her . ";Ron;Harry,Hermione,Professor,;0.65;3096;73
" She might not have needed saving if we had n't locked the thing in with her , " Harry reminded him .;Harry;Hermione,Professor,Ron,;0.0;3097;73
" Pig snout , " they said and entered .;Professor;Harry,Hermione,Ron,;0.0;3099;73
Then , none of them looking at each other , they all said " Thanks , " and hurried off to get plates .;Hermione;Harry,Professor,Ron,;0.0375;3104;73
" What 's that you 've got there , Potter ? ";Ron;Snape,Harry,;0.0;3133;74
" Library books are not to be taken outside the school , " said Snape . " Give it to me . Five points from Gryffindor . ";Snape;Harry,Ron,;0.0;3136;74
" He 's just made that rule up , " Harry muttered angrily as Snape limped away . " Wonder what 's wrong with his leg ? ";Harry;Snape,Ron,;-0.5;3137;74
" Dunno , but I hope it 's really hurting him , " said Ron bitterly .;Ron;Snape,Harry,;0.0;3138;74
She would never let them copy ( " How will you learn ? " );Harry;;0.0;3143;75
" Better you than me , " they said together , but Harry had an idea that Snape would n't refuse if there were other teachers listening .;Harry;;0.1875;3149;75
" Blasted thing , " Snape was saying . " How are you supposed to keep your eyes on all three heads at once ? ";Snape;Harry,Ron,Hermione,something,;-0.6;3161;76
" POTTER ! ";Ron;Snape,Harry,Hermione,something,;0.0;3163;76
" I just wondered if I could have my book back . ";Harry;Snape,Ron,Hermione,something,;0.0;3166;76
" GET OUT ! OUT ! ";Ron;Snape,Harry,Hermione,something,;0.0;3167;76
" Did you get it ? ";something;Snape,Harry,Ron,Hermione,;0.0;3170;76
Ron asked as Harry joined them . " What 's the matter ? ";Ron;Snape,Harry,Hermione,something,;0.0;3171;76
" You know what this means ? ";Snape;Harry,Ron,Hermione,something,;0.0;3173;76
he finished breathlessly . " He tried to get past that three-headed dog at Halloween ! That 's where he was going when we saw him - he 's after whatever it 's guarding ! And I'd bet my broomstick he let that troll in , to make a diversion ! ";Hermione;I'd,;-0.48828125;3174;76
" No - he would n't , she said . ";Ron;Snape,Harry,Hermione,something,;0.0;3176;76
I know he 's not very nice , but he would n't try and steal something Dumbledore was keeping safe . ";something;Snape,Harry,Ron,Hermione,;0.64;3177;76
" Honestly , Hermione , you think all teachers are saints or something , " snapped Ron . " I 'm with Harry . I would n't put anything past Snape . But what 's he after ? What 's that dog guarding ? ";Ron;past,;-0.25;3178;76
" You 've got to eat some breakfast . ";Hall;Hermione,Seamus,Harry,;0.0;3185;77
" I do n't want anything . ";Seamus;Hall,Hermione,Harry,;0.0;3186;77
" Just a bit of toast , " wheedled Hermione .;Hermione;Hall,Seamus,Harry,;0.0;3187;77
" I 'm not hungry . ";Hall;Hermione,Seamus,Harry,;0.0;3188;77
" Harry , you need your strength , " said Seamus Finnigan . " Seekers are always the ones who get clobbered by the other team . ";Seamus;Hall,Hermione,Harry,;-0.125;3191;77
" Thanks , Seamus , " said Harry , watching Seamus pile ketchup on his sausages .;Harry;Hall,Hermione,Seamus,;0.2;3192;77
" Okay , men , " he said .;Wood;Chaser,Weasley,George,Fred,Harry,Lee,Slytherin,Hagrid,Ron,;0.5;3203;78
" And women , " said Chaser Angelina Johnson .;Chaser;Wood,Weasley,George,Fred,Harry,Lee,Slytherin,Hagrid,Ron,;0.0;3204;78
" And women , " Wood agreed . " This is it . ";Wood;Chaser,Weasley,George,Fred,Harry,Lee,Slytherin,Hagrid,Ron,;0.0;3205;78
" The big one , " said Fred Weasley .;Weasley;Chaser,Wood,George,Fred,Harry,Lee,Slytherin,Hagrid,Ron,;0.0;3206;78
" The one we 've all been waiting for , " said George .;George;Chaser,Wood,Weasley,Fred,Harry,Lee,Slytherin,Hagrid,Ron,;0.0;3207;78
" We know Oliver 's speech by heart , " Fred told Harry , " we were on the team last year . ";Fred;Oliver,;0.0;3208;78
" Shut up , you two , " said Wood . " This is the best team Gryffindor 's had in years . We 're going to win . I know it . ";Wood;team,;0.9;3209;78
He glared at them all as if to say , " Or else . ";Hagrid;Chaser,Wood,Weasley,George,Fred,Harry,Lee,Slytherin,Ron,;0.0;3210;78
" Right . It 's time . Good luck , all of you . ";Harry;Chaser,Wood,Weasley,George,Fred,Lee,Slytherin,Hagrid,Ron,;0.467857142857;3211;78
" Now , I want a nice fair game , all of you , " she said , once they were all gathered around her .;Wood;Chaser,Weasley,George,Fred,Harry,Lee,Slytherin,Hagrid,Ron,;0.3;3215;78
" Mount your brooms , please . ";Harry;Chaser,Wood,Weasley,George,Fred,Lee,Slytherin,Hagrid,Ron,;0.0;3221;78
" And the Quaffle is taken immediately by Angelina Johnson of Gryffindor - what an excellent Chaser that girl is , and rather attractive , too - ";Wood;Quaffle,;0.9;3226;78
" JORDAN ! ";Hagrid;Chaser,Wood,Weasley,George,Fred,Harry,Lee,Slytherin,Ron,;0.0;3227;78
" Sorry , Professor . ";Lee;Chaser,Wood,Weasley,George,Fred,Harry,Slytherin,Hagrid,Ron,;-0.5;3228;78
" And she 's really belting along up there , a neat pass to Alicia Spinnet , a good find of Oliver Wood ' s , last year only a reserve - back to Johnson and - no , the Slytherins have taken the Quaffle , Slytherin Captain Marcus Flint gains the Quaffle and off he goes - Flint flying like an eagle up there - he 's going to sc - no , stopped by an excellent move by Gryffindor Keeper Wood and the Gryffindors take the Quaffle - that 's Chaser Katie Bell of Gryffindor there , nice dive around Flint , off up the field and - OUCH - that must have hurt , hit in the back of the head by a Bludger - Quaffle taken by the Slytherins - that 's Adrian Pucey speeding off toward the goal posts , but he 's blocked by a second Bludger - sent his way by Fred or George Weasley , ca n't tell which - nice play by the Gryffindor Beater , anyway , and Johnson back in possession of the Quaffle , a clear field ahead and off she goes - she 's really flying - dodges a speeding Bludger - the goal posts are ahead - come on , now , Angelina - Keeper Bletchley dives - misses - GRYFFINDORS SCORE !

" Hagrid ! ";Wood;Chaser,Weasley,George,Fred,Harry,Lee,Slytherin,Hagrid,Ron,;0.0;3233;78
" Bin watchin ' from me hut , " said Hagrid , patting a large pair of binoculars around his neck , " But it is n't the same as bein ' in the crowd . No sign of the Snitch yet , eh ? ";Hagrid;Chaser,Wood,Weasley,George,Fred,Harry,Lee,Slytherin,Ron,;0.107142857143;3235;78
" Nope , " said Ron . " Harry has n't had much to do yet . ";Ron;Harry,;0.1;3236;78
" Kept outta trouble , though , that 's somethin ' , " said Hagrid , raising his binoculars and peering skyward at the speck that was Harry .;Hagrid;Chaser,Wood,Weasley,George,Fred,Harry,Lee,Slytherin,Ron,;0.0;3237;78
" Keep out of the way until you catch sight of the Snitch , " Wood had said . " We do n't want you attacked before you have to be . ";Wood;Chaser,Weasley,George,Fred,Harry,Lee,Slytherin,Hagrid,Ron,;0.0;3240;78
" All right there , Harry ? ";Hagrid;Chaser,Wood,Weasley,George,Fred,Harry,Lee,Slytherin,Ron,;0.285714285714;3244;78
" Slytherin in possession , " Lee Jordan was saying , " Chaser Pucey ducks two Bludgers , two Weasleys , and Chaser Bell , and speeds toward the - wait a moment - was that the Snitch ? ";Lee;Chaser,Wood,Weasley,George,Fred,Harry,Slytherin,Hagrid,Ron,;0.0;3246;78
" Foul ! ";Professor;Dean,Ron,Lee,Harry,;0.0;3255;79
Down in the stands , Dean Thomas was yelling , " Send him off , ref ! Red card ! ";Dean;Ron,Lee,Professor,Harry,;-0.121527777778;3259;79
" What are you talking about , Dean ? ";Professor;Dean,Ron,Lee,Harry,;0.0;3260;79

said Dean furiously . " In soccer you get shown the red card and you 're out of the game ! ";Dean;Ron,Lee,Professor,Harry,;-0.25;3263;79
" But this is n't soccer , Dean , " Ron reminded him .;Ron;Dean,Lee,Professor,Harry,;0.0;3264;79
" They oughta change the rules . Flint coulda knocked Harry outta the air . ";Dean;Harry,;0.0;3266;79
" So - after that obvious and disgusting bit of cheating - ";Lee;Dean,Ron,Professor,Harry,;-0.5;3268;79
" Jordan ! ";Dean;Ron,Lee,Professor,Harry,;0.0;3269;79
" I mean , after that open and revolting foul ... ";Professor;Dean,Ron,Lee,Harry,;-0.15625;3271;79
" Jordan , I 'm warning you - ";Dean;Ron,Lee,Professor,Harry,;0.0;3272;79
" All right , all right . Flint nearly kills the Gryffindor Seeker , which could happen to anyone , I 'm sure , so a penalty to Gryffindor , taken by Spinner , who puts it away , no trouble , and we continue play , Gryffindor still in possession . ";Harry;Flint,;0.357142857143;3273;79

" Dunno what Harry thinks he 's doing , " Hagrid mumbled .;Hagrid;Harry,;0.0;3291;80
He stared through his binoculars . " If I didn ' know better , I'd say he'd lost control of his broom...but he ca n't have ... ";Hermione;I'd,;0.5;3292;80
" Did something happen to it when Flint blocked him ? ";Ron;Flint,;0.0;3298;80
" Ca n't have , " Hagrid said , his voice shaking . " Ca n't nothing interfere with a broomstick except powerful Dark magic - no kid could do that to a Nimbus Two Thousand . ";Hagrid;Hermione,Ron,;0.216666666667;3300;80
" What are you doing ? ";Ron;Hagrid,Hermione,;0.0;3302;80
" I knew it , " Hermione gasped , " Snape - look . ";Hermione;Hagrid,Ron,;0.0;3304;80
" He 's doing something - jinxing the broom , " said Hermione .;Hermione;Hagrid,Ron,;0.0;3308;80
" What should we do ? ";Hagrid;Hermione,Ron,;0.0;3309;80
" Leave it to me . ";Hermione;Hagrid,Ron,;0.0;3310;80
" Come on , Hermione , " Ron muttered desperately .;Ron;Hagrid,Hermione,;0.0;3317;80
" Neville , you can look ! ";Ron;Flint,Hagrid,Snape,Harry,;0.0;3326;81
" I 've got the Snitch ! ";Hagrid;Snitch,;0.0;3330;81
" He did n't catch it , he nearly swallowed it , " Flint was still howling twenty minutes later , but it made no difference - Harry had n't broken any rules and Lee Jordan was still happily shouting the results - Gryffindor had won by one hundred and seventy points to sixty .;Flint;Ron,Hagrid,Snape,Harry,;-0.2;3332;81
" It was Snape , " Ron was explaining , " Hermione and I saw him . He was cursing your broomstick , muttering , he would n't take his eyes off you . ";Ron;Snape,;0.0;3335;81
" Rubbish , " said Hagrid , who had n't heard a word of what had gone on next to him in the stands . " Why would Snape do somethin ' like that ? ";Hagrid;Snape,;0.0;3336;81
" I found out something about him , " he told Hagrid . " He tried to get past that three-headed dog on Halloween . It bit him . We think he was trying to steal whatever it 's guarding . ";Hagrid;Ron,Flint,Snape,Harry,;-0.25;3339;81
" How do you know about Fluffy ? ";Ron;Flint,Hagrid,Snape,Harry,;0.0;3341;81
" Fluffy ? ";Hagrid;Ron,Flint,Snape,Harry,;0.0;3343;81
" Yeah - he 's mine - bought him off a Greek chappie I met in the pub las ' year - I lent him to Dumbledore to guard the - ";Ron;Flint,Hagrid,Snape,Harry,;0.0;3344;81
" Yes ? ";Snape;Ron,Flint,Hagrid,Harry,;0.0;3345;81
" Now , do n't ask me anymore , " said Hagrid gruffly . " That 's top secret , that is . ";Hagrid;Ron,Flint,Snape,Harry,;0.05;3347;81
" But Snape 's trying to steal it . ";Ron;Flint,Hagrid,Snape,Harry,;0.0;3348;81
" Rubbish , " said Hagrid again . " Snape 's a Hogwarts teacher , he'd do nothin ' of the sort . ";Hagrid;Snape,;0.0;3349;81
" So why did he just try and kill Harry ? ";Ron;Harry,;0.0;3350;81
" I know a jinx when I see one , Hagrid , I 've read all about them ! You 've got to keep eye contact , and Snape was n't blinking at all , I saw him ! ";Snape;Snape,;0.0;3353;81
" I 'm tellin ' yeh , yer wrong ! ";Ron;Flint,Hagrid,Snape,Harry,;-0.625;3354;81
said Hagrid hotly . " I don ' know why Harry 's broom acted like that , but Snape wouldn ' try an ' kill a student ! Now , listen to me , all three of yeh - yer meddlin ' in things that don ' concern yeh . It 's dangerous . You forget that dog , an ' you forget what it 's guardin ' , that 's between Professor Dumbledore an ' Nicolas Flamel - ";Hagrid;Flamel,;-0.6;3355;81
" Aha ! ";Ron;Flint,Hagrid,Snape,Harry,;0.0;3356;81
said Harry , " so there 's someone called Nicolas Flamel involved , is there ? ";Harry;Flamel,;0.0;3357;81
" I do feel so sorry , " said Draco Malfoy , one Potions class , " for all those people who have to stay at Hogwarts for Christmas because they 're not wanted at home . ";Malfoy;;-0.5;3371;82
" Hi , Hagrid , want any help ? ";Hagrid;Malfoy,Snape,Ron,Harry,Hermione,;0.0;3385;83
" Nah , I 'm all right , thanks , Ron . ";Harry;Hagrid,Malfoy,Snape,Ron,Hermione,;0.242857142857;3387;83
" Would you mind moving out of the way ? ";Hagrid;Malfoy,Snape,Ron,Harry,Hermione,;0.0;3388;83
came Malfoy 's cold drawl from behind them . " Are you trying to earn some extra money , Weasley ? Hoping to be gamekeeper yourself when you leave Hogwarts , I suppose - that hut of Hagrid 's must seem like a palace compared to what your family 's used to . ";Malfoy;Hogwarts,;-0.333333333333;3389;83
" WEASLEY ! ";Harry;Hagrid,Malfoy,Snape,Ron,Hermione,;0.0;3391;83
" He was provoked , Professor Snape , " said Hagrid , sticking his huge hairy face out from behind the tree . " Malfoy was insultin ' his family . ";Hagrid;Malfoy,;2.77555756156e-17;3393;83
" Be that as it may , fighting is against Hogwarts rules , Hagrid , " said Snape silkily . " Five points from Gryffindor , Weasley , and be grateful it is n't more . Move along , all of you . ";Snape;Hagrid,Malfoy,Ron,Harry,Hermione,;0.5;3394;83
" I 'll get him , " said Ron , grinding his teeth at Malfoy 's back , " one of these days , I 'll get him - ";Ron;Hagrid,Malfoy,Snape,Harry,Hermione,;0.0;3396;83
" I hate them both , " said Harry , " Malfoy and Snape . ";Harry;Hagrid,Malfoy,Snape,Ron,Hermione,;-0.8;3397;83
" Come on , cheer up , it 's nearly Christmas , " said Hagrid . " Tell yeh what , come with me an ' see the Great Hall , looks a treat . ";Hagrid;Hall,;0.8;3398;83
" Ah , Hagrid , the last tree - put it in the far corner , would you ? ";Harry;Hagrid,Malfoy,Snape,Ron,Hermione,;0.05;3400;83
" How many days you got left until yer holidays ? ";Hagrid;Malfoy,Snape,Ron,Harry,Hermione,;0.25;3403;83
" Just one , " said Hermione . " And that reminds me - Harry , Ron , we 've got half an hour before lunch , we should be in the library . ";Hermione;Hagrid,Malfoy,Snape,Ron,Harry,;-0.166666666667;3405;83
" Oh yeah , you 're right , " said Ron , tearing his eyes away from Professor Flitwick , who had golden bubbles blossoming out of his wand and was trailing them over the branches of the new tree .;Ron;Hagrid,Malfoy,Snape,Harry,Hermione,;0.240692640693;3406;83
" The library ? ";Harry;Hagrid,Malfoy,Snape,Ron,Hermione,;0.0;3407;83
said Hagrid , following them out of the hall . " Just before the holidays ? Bit keen , are n't yeh ? ";Hagrid;Malfoy,Snape,Ron,Harry,Hermione,;0.0;3408;83
" Oh , we 're not working , " Harry told him brightly . " Ever since you mentioned Nicolas Flamel we 've been trying to find out who he is . ";Harry;Hagrid,Malfoy,Snape,Ron,Hermione,;0.0;3409;83
" You what ? ";Ron;Hagrid,Malfoy,Snape,Harry,Hermione,;0.0;3410;83
Hagrid looked shocked . " Listen here - I 've told yeh - drop it . It 's nothin ' to you what that dog 's guardin ' . ";Hagrid;Malfoy,Snape,Ron,Harry,Hermione,;-0.7;3411;83
" We just want to know who Nicolas Flamel is , that 's all , " said Hermione .;Hermione;Flamel,;0.0;3412;83
" Unless you'd like to tell us and save us the trouble ? ";Hagrid;Malfoy,Snape,Ron,Harry,Hermione,;0.0;3413;83
Harry added . " We must 've been through hundreds of books already and we ca n't find him anywhere - just give us a hint - I know I 've read his name somewhere . ";Harry;Hagrid,Malfoy,Snape,Ron,Hermione,;0.0;3414;83
" I 'm sayin ' nothin ' , said Hagrid flatly .;Ron;Hagrid,Malfoy,Snape,Harry,Hermione,;0.0;3415;83
" Just have to find out for ourselves , then , " said Ron , and they left Hagrid looking disgruntled and hurried off to the library .;Hagrid;Malfoy,Snape,Ron,Harry,Hermione,;0.0;3416;83
" What are you looking for , boy ? ";Harry;;0.0;3426;84
" Nothing , " said Harry .;Harry;;0.0;3427;84
" You'd better get out , then . Go on - out ! ";Harry;;0.625;3429;84
" You will keep looking while I 'm away , wo n't you ? ";Hermione;Ron,;0.0;3438;85
said Hermione . " And send me an owl if you find anything . ";Hermione;Ron,;0.0;3439;85
" And you could ask your parents if they know who Flamel is , " said Ron . " It'd be safe to ask them . ";Ron;Flamel,It'd,;0.5;3440;85
" Very safe , as they 're both dentists , " said Hermione .;Hermione;Ron,;0.65;3441;85
He was n't a very good player yet and they kept shouting different bits of advice at him , which was confusing . " Do n't send me there , ca n't you see his knight ? Send him , we can afford to lose him . ";Harry;;0.181666666667;3453;86
" Merry Christmas , " said Ron sleepily as Harry scrambled out of bed and pulled on his bathrobe .;Harry;;0.0;3456;86
" You , too , " said Harry . " Will you look at this ? I 've got some presents ! ";Harry;;0.0;3457;86
" What did you expect , turnips ? ";Harry;;0.0;3458;86
" That 's friendly , " said Harry .;Harry;Ron,Hermione,;0.375;3469;87
" Weird ! ";Ron;Harry,Hermione,;-0.625;3471;87
This is money ? ";Harry;Ron,Hermione,;0.0;3473;87
" You can keep it , " said Harry , laughing at how pleased Ron was . " Hagrid and my aunt and uncle - so who sent these ? ";Ron;Harry,Hermione,;0.5;3474;87
" I think I know who that one 's from , " said Ron , turning a bit pink and pointing to a very lumpy parcel . " My mom . I told her you did n't expect any presents and - oh , no , " he groaned , " she 's made you a Weasley sweater . ";Ron;Harry,Hermione,;0.05;3475;87
" Every year she makes us a sweater , " said Ron , unwrapping his own , " and mine 's always maroon . ";Ron;Harry,Hermione,;0.6;3477;87
" That 's really nice of her , " said Harry , trying the fudge , which was very tasty .;Harry;Ron,Hermione,;0.6;3478;87
" I 've heard of those , " he said in a hushed voice , dropping the box of Every Flavor Beans he'd gotten from Hermione . " If that 's what I think it is - they 're really rare , and really valuable . ";Hermione;Harry,Ron,;0.3;3486;87
" What is it ? ";Harry;Ron,Hermione,;0.0;3487;87
" It 's an invisibility cloak , " said Ron , a look of awe on his face . " I 'm sure it is - try it on . ";Ron;Harry,Hermione,;0.5;3490;87
" It is ! Look down ! ";Harry;Ron,Hermione,;-0.194444444444;3492;87
" There 's a note ! ";Hermione;Harry,Ron,;0.0;3497;87
said Ron suddenly . " A note fell out of it ! ";Ron;Harry,Hermione,;0.0;3498;87
" I'd give anything for one of these , " he said . " Anything . What 's the matter ? ";George;I'd,;0.0;3510;88
" Nothing , " said Harry .;Harry;Fred,George,Ron,Percy,;0.0;3511;88
" Merry Christmas ! ";George;Harry,Fred,Ron,Percy,;0.0;3518;88
" Hey , look - Harry 's got a Weasley sweater , too ! ";Percy;Harry,;0.0;3519;88
" Harry 's is better than ours , though , " said Fred , holding up Harry 's sweater . " She obviously makes more of an effort if you 're not family . ";Fred;Harry,George,Ron,Percy,;0.5;3521;88
" Why are n't you wearing yours , Ron ? ";Percy;Harry,Fred,George,Ron,;0.0;3522;88
George demanded . " Come on , get it on , they 're lovely and warm . ";George;Harry,Fred,Ron,Percy,;0.55;3523;88
" I hate maroon , " Ron moaned halfheartedly as he pulled it over his head .;Ron;Harry,Fred,George,Percy,;-0.8;3524;88
" You have n't got a letter on yours , " George observed . " I suppose she thinks you do n't forget your name . But we 're not stupid - we know we 're called Gred and Forge . ";George;Forge,;-0.8;3525;88
" What 's all this noise ? ";Percy;Harry,Fred,George,Ron,;0.0;3526;88
" P for prefect ! Get it on , Percy , come on , we 're all wearing ours , even Harry got one . ";George;Harry,;0.0;3529;88
" I - do n't - want - " said Percy thickly , as the twins forced the sweater over his head , knocking his glasses askew .;Percy;Harry,Fred,George,Ron,;-0.2;3530;88
" And you 're not sitting with the prefects today , either , " said George . " Christmas is a time for family . ";George;Christmas,;0.0;3531;88
" Who 's there ? ";Lady;;0.0;3568;89
" You asked me to come directly to you , Professor , if anyone was wandering around at night , and somebody 's been in the library Restricted Section . ";Filch;;0.0;3602;90
Wherever he was , Filch must know a shortcut , because his soft , greasy voice was getting nearer , and to his horror , it was Snape who replied , " The Restricted Section ? Well , they ca n't be far , we 'll catch them . ";Filch;;0.1;3604;90
" Mom ? ";Harry;;0.0;3640;91
he whispered . " Dad ? ";Harry;;0.0;3641;91
He tore his eyes away from his mother 's face , whispered , " I 'll come back , " and hurried from the room .;Harry;;0.0;3649;91
" You could have woken me up , " said Ron , crossly .;Ron;;0.0;3651;92
" You can come tonight , I 'm going back , I want to show you the mirror .;Ron;;0.0;3652;92
" I'd like to see your mom and dad , " Ron said eagerly .;Ron;I'd,;0.0;3653;92
" And I want to see all your family , all the Weasleys , you 'll be able to show me your other brothers and everyone . ";Ron;;0.1875;3654;92
" You can see them any old time , " said Ron . " Just come round my house this summer . Anyway , maybe it only shows dead people . Shame about not finding Flamel , though . Have some bacon or something , why are n't you eating anything ? ";Ron;Flamel,;-0.075;3655;92
" Are you all right ? ";Ron;;0.285714285714;3662;92
said Ron . " You look odd . ";Ron;;-0.166666666667;3663;92
" I 'm freezing , " said Ron . " Let 's forget it and go back . ";Ron;Harry,;0.0;3668;93
" No ! ";Ron;Harry,;0.0;3669;93
I know it 's here somewhere . ";Harry;Ron,;0.0;3671;93
" It 's here - just here - yes ! ";Ron;Harry,;0.0;3674;93
" See ? ";Harry;Ron,;0.0;3679;93
" I ca n't see anything . ";Ron;Harry,;0.0;3681;93
" Look ! Look at them all...there are loads of them ... ";Ron;Harry,;0.0;3682;93
" I can only see you . ";Ron;Harry,;0.0;3683;93
" Look in it properly , go on , stand where I am . ";Ron;Harry,;0.0;3684;93
" Look at me ! ";Ron;Harry,;0.0;3687;93
" Can you see all your family standing around you ? ";Ron;Harry,;0.0;3689;93
" No - I 'm alone - but I 'm different - I look older - and I 'm head boy ! ";Ron;Harry,;0.104166666667;3690;93
" What ? ";Ron;Harry,;0.0;3691;93
" I am - I 'm wearing the badge like Bill used to - and I 'm holding the house cup and the Quidditch cup - I 'm Quidditch captain , too . ";Ron;Bill,;0.0;3692;93
" Do you think this mirror shows the future ? ";Ron;Harry,;0.0;3694;93
" How can it ? All my family are dead - let me have another look - ";Ron;Harry,;-0.2;3695;93
" You had it to yourself all last night , give me a bit more time . ";Ron;Harry,;0.25;3696;93
" You 're only holding the Quidditch cup , what 's interesting about that ? I want to see my parents . ";Ron;Harry,;0.25;3697;93
" Do n't push me - ";Ron;Harry,;0.0;3698;93
" Quick ! ";Ron;Harry,;0.416666666667;3701;93
" This is n't safe - she might have gone for Filch , I bet she heard us . Come on . ";Ron;Harry,;0.5;3705;93
" Want to play chess , Harry ? ";Ron;;0.0;3709;94
" No . ";Ron;;0.0;3711;94
" Why do n't we go down and visit Hagrid ? ";Ron;;-0.155555555556;3712;94
" No...you go ... ";Ron;No...you,;0.0;3713;94
" I know what you 're thinking about , Harry , that mirror . Do n't go back tonight . ";Ron;;0.0;3714;94
" Why not ? ";Ron;;0.0;3715;94
" I dunno , I 've just got a bad feeling about it - and anyway , you 've had too many close shaves already . Filch , Snape , and Mrs. Norris are wandering around . So what if they ca n't see you ? What if they walk into you ? What if you knock something over ? ";Ron;Norris,;-0.0583333333333;3716;94
" You sound like Hermione . ";Ron;;0.4;3717;94
" I 'm serious , Harry , do n't go . ";Ron;;-0.333333333333;3718;94
" So - back again , Harry ? ";Harry;Dumbledore,gently,;0.0;3728;95
" I - I did n't see you , sir . ";Dumbledore;Harry,gently,;0.0;3733;95
" Strange how nearsighted being invisible can make you , " said Dumbledore , and Harry was relieved to see that he was smiling .;Harry;Dumbledore,gently,;-0.05;3734;95
" So , " said Dumbledore , slipping off the desk to sit on the floor with Harry , " you , like hundreds before you , have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised . ";Dumbledore;Harry,gently,;-0.1;3735;95
" I did n't know it was called that , Sir . ";Harry;Dumbledore,gently,;0.0;3736;95
" But I expect you 've realized by now what it does ? ";Dumbledore;Harry,gently,;0.0;3737;95
" It - well - it shows me my family - ";Harry;Dumbledore,gently,;0.0;3738;95
" And it showed your friend Ron himself as head boy . ";Dumbledore;Harry,gently,;0.0;3739;95
" How did you know - ? ";Harry;Dumbledore,gently,;0.0;3740;95
" I do n't need a cloak to become invisible , " said Dumbledore gently . " Now , can you think what the Mirror of Erised shows us all ? ";gently;Erised,;0.0;3741;95
" Let me explain . The happiest man on earth would be able to use the Mirror of Erised like a normal mirror , that is , he would look into it and see himself exactly as he is . Does that help ? ";Dumbledore;earth,Mirror,;0.325;3743;95
Then he said slowly , " It shows us what we want...whatever we want ... ";Harry;Dumbledore,gently,;0.0;3745;95
" Yes and no , " said Dumbledore quietly . " It shows us nothing more or less than the deepest , most desperate desire of our hearts . You , who have never known your family , see them standing around you . Ronald Weasley , who has always been overshadowed by his brothers , sees himself standing alone , the best of all of them . However , this mirror will give us neither knowledge or truth . Men have wasted away before it , entranced by what they have seen , or been driven mad , not knowing if what it shows is real or even possible .;Dumbledore;Harry,gently,;0.0564814814815;3746;95
" The Mirror will be moved to a new home tomorrow , Harry , and I ask you not to go looking for it again . If you ever do run across it , you will now be prepared . It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live , remember that . Now , why do n't you put that admirable cloak back on and get off to bed ? ";Harry;Mirror,;0.0909090909091;3747;95
" Sir - Professor Dumbledore ? Can I ask you something ? ";gently;Harry,Dumbledore,;0.0;3749;95
" Obviously , you 've just done so , " Dumbledore smiled . " You may ask me one more thing , however . ";Dumbledore;Harry,gently,;0.55;3750;95
" What do you see when you look in the mirror ? ";Harry;Dumbledore,gently,;0.0;3751;95
" I ? I see myself holding a pair of thick , woolen socks . ";gently;Harry,Dumbledore,;-0.3;3752;95
" One can never have enough socks , " said Dumbledore . " Another Christmas has come and gone and I did n't get a single pair . People will insist on giving me books . ";Dumbledore;Christmas,;-0.0357142857143;3754;95
" You see , Dumbledore was right , that mirror could drive you mad , " said Ron , when Harry told him about these dreams .;Harry;Dumbledore,;-0.169642857143;3766;96
She was torn between horror at the idea of Harry being out of bed , roaming the school three nights in a row ( " If Filch had caught you ! " );Harry;Filch,;0.0;3768;96
" Will you stop messing around ! ";He'd;Weasley,Wood,Harry,Hermione,Ron,Neville,shakily,,;0.0;3780;97
he yelled . " That 's exactly the sort of thing that 'll lose us the match ! Snape 's refereeing this time , and he 'll be looking for any excuse to knock points off Gryffindor ! ";Harry;Snape,;0.0;3781;97
" Snape 's refereeing ? ";Weasley;He'd,Wood,Harry,Hermione,Ron,Neville,shakily,,;0.0;3783;97
he spluttered through a mouthful of mud . " When 's he ever refereed a Quidditch match ? He 's not going to be fair if we might overtake Slytherin . ";Harry;Slytherin,;0.7;3784;97
" It 's not my fault , " said Wood . " We 've just got to make sure we play a clean game , so Snape has n't got an excuse to pick on us . ";Wood;Snape,;0.155555555556;3786;97
" Do n't talk to me for a moment , " said Ron when Harry sat down next to him , " I need to concen - " He caught sight of Harry 's face .;Harry;He'd,Weasley,Wood,Hermione,Ron,Neville,shakily,,;-0.0777777777778;3790;97
" What 's the matter with you ? You look terrible . ";Ron;He'd,Weasley,Wood,Harry,Hermione,Neville,shakily,,;-1.0;3791;97
" Do n't play , " said Hermione at once .;Hermione;He'd,Weasley,Wood,Harry,Ron,Neville,shakily,,;0.0;3793;97
" Say you 're ill , " said Ron .;Ron;He'd,Weasley,Wood,Harry,Hermione,Neville,shakily,,;-0.5;3794;97
" Pretend to break your leg , " Hermione suggested .;Hermione;He'd,Weasley,Wood,Harry,Ron,Neville,shakily,,;0.0;3795;97
" Really break your leg , " said Ron .;Ron;He'd,Weasley,Wood,Harry,Hermione,Neville,shakily,,;0.0;3796;97
" I ca n't , " said Harry . " There is n't a reserve Seeker . If I back out , Gryffindor ca n't play at all . ";Harry;Gryffindor,;0.0;3797;97
Neville 's legs sprang apart and he got to his feet , trembling . " What happened ? ";Neville;He'd,Weasley,Wood,Harry,Hermione,Ron,shakily,,;0.0;3802;97
" Malfoy , " said Neville shakily . " I met him outside the library . He said he'd been looking for someone to practice that on . ";shakily;He'd,Weasley,Wood,Harry,Hermione,Ron,Neville,,;0.0;3804;97
" Go to Professor McGonagall ! ";Harry;He'd,Weasley,Wood,Hermione,Ron,Neville,shakily,,;0.0;3805;97
Hermione urged Neville . " Report him ! ";Hermione;He'd,Weasley,Wood,Harry,Ron,Neville,shakily,,;0.0;3806;97
" I do n't want more trouble , " he mumbled .;Harry;He'd,Weasley,Wood,Hermione,Ron,Neville,shakily,,;0.5;3808;97
" You 've got to stand up to him , Neville ! ";Hermione;He'd,Weasley,Wood,Harry,Ron,Neville,shakily,,;0.0;3809;97
said Ron . " He 's used to walking all over people , but that 's no reason to lie down in front of him and make it easier . ";Ron;He'd,Weasley,Wood,Harry,Hermione,Neville,shakily,,;-0.155555555556;3810;97
" There 's no need to tell me I 'm not brave enough to be in Gryffindor , Malfoy 's already done that , " Neville choked out .;Neville;He'd,Weasley,Wood,Harry,Hermione,Ron,shakily,,;0.4;3811;97
" You 're worth twelve of Malfoy , " Harry said . " The Sorting Hat chose you for Gryffindor , did n't it ? And where 's Malfoy ? In stinking Slytherin . ";Harry;Hat,Gryffindor,;0.3;3814;97
" Thanks , Harry...I think I 'll go to bed....D'you want the card , you collect them , do n't you ? ";Hermione;Harry,;0.2;3816;97
" Dumbledore again , " he said , " He was the first one I ever - ";Harry;He'd,Weasley,Wood,Hermione,Ron,Neville,shakily,,;0.25;3818;97
" I 've found him ! ";Ron;He'd,Weasley,Wood,Harry,Hermione,Neville,shakily,,;0.0;3822;97
he whispered . " I 've found Flamel ! I told you I'd read the name somewhere before , I read it on the train coming here - listen to this : ' Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945 , for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon 's blood , and his work on alchemy with his partner , Nicolas Flamel ' !

" Stay there ! ";Ron;He'd,Weasley,Wood,Harry,Hermione,Neville,shakily,,;0.0;3826;97
" I never thought to look in here ! ";Harry;He'd,Weasley,Wood,Hermione,Ron,Neville,shakily,,;0.0;3829;97
she whispered excitedly . " I got this out of the library weeks ago for a bit of light reading . ";Ron;He'd,Weasley,Wood,Harry,Hermione,Neville,shakily,,;0.4;3830;97
" Light ? ";Hermione;He'd,Weasley,Wood,Harry,Ron,Neville,shakily,,;0.4;3831;97
" I knew it ! I knew it ! ";Harry;He'd,Weasley,Wood,Hermione,Ron,Neville,shakily,,;0.0;3834;97
" Are we allowed to speak yet ? ";;He'd,Weasley,Wood,Harry,Hermione,Ron,Neville,shakily,;0.0;3835;97
" Nicolas Flamel , " she whispered dramatically , " is the only known maker of the Sorcerer 's Stone ! ";Hermione;He'd,Weasley,Wood,Harry,Ron,Neville,shakily,,;0.0;3838;97
" The what ? ";Harry;He'd,Weasley,Wood,Hermione,Ron,Neville,shakily,,;0.0;3840;97
" Oh , honestly , do n't you two read ? Look - read that , there . ";Hermione;He'd,Weasley,Wood,Harry,Ron,Neville,shakily,,;0.0;3842;97
" See ? ";Harry;Ron,;0.0;3851;98
said Hermione , when Harry and Ron had finished . " The dog must be guarding Flamel 's Sorcerer 's Stone ! I bet he asked Dumbledore to keep it safe for him , because they 're friends and he knew someone was after it , that 's why he wanted the Stone moved out of Gringotts ! ";Harry;Stone,Dumbledore,;0.625;3852;98
" A stone that makes gold and stops you from ever dying ! ";Harry;Ron,;0.0;3853;98
said Harry . " No wonder Snape 's after it ! Anyone would want it . ";Harry;Ron,;0.0;3854;98
" And no wonder we could n't find Flamel in that Study of Recent Developments in Wizardry , " said Ron . " He 's not exactly recent if he 's six hundred and sixty-five , is he ? ";Ron;Flamel,;0.0;3855;98
" I 'm going to play , " he told Ron and Hermione . " If I do n't , all the Slytherins will think I 'm just too scared to face Snape . I 'll show them...it 'll really wipe the smiles off their faces if we win . ";Ron;Slytherin,Snape,;0.4;3859;99
" Just as long as we 're not wiping you off the field , " said Hermione .;Hermione;Ron,;-0.05;3860;99
" Now , do n't forget , it 's Locomotor Mortis , " Hermione muttered as Ron slipped his wand up his sleeve .;Hermione;Ron,Weasley,Snape,Goyle,suddenly,Harry,;0.0;3877;100
" I know , " Ron snapped . " Do n't nag . ";Ron;Hermione,Weasley,Snape,Goyle,suddenly,Harry,;0.0;3878;100
" Do n't want to pressure you , Potter , but if we ever need an early capture of the Snitch it 's now . Finish the game before Snape can favor Hufflepuff too much . ";Hermione;Snape,Hufflepuff,;-0.0666666666667;3880;100
" The whole school 's out there ! ";Ron;Hermione,Weasley,Snape,Goyle,suddenly,Harry,;0.25;3881;100
said Fred Weasley , peering out of the door . " Even - blimey - Dumbledore 's come to watch ! ";Weasley;Hermione,Ron,Snape,Goyle,suddenly,Harry,;0.0;3882;100
" Dumbledore ? ";Ron;Hermione,Weasley,Snape,Goyle,suddenly,Harry,;0.0;3884;100
" I 've never seen Snape look so mean , " he told Hermione . " Look - they 're off . Ouch ! ";Hermione;Snape,;-0.390625;3891;100
" Oh , sorry , Weasley , did n't see you there . ";suddenly;Hermione,Ron,Weasley,Snape,Goyle,Harry,;-0.5;3894;100
" Wonder how long Potter 's going to stay on his broom this time ? Anyone want a bet ? What about you , Weasley ? ";Ron;Hermione,Weasley,Snape,Goyle,suddenly,Harry,;-0.05;3896;100
" You know how I think they choose people for the Gryffindor team ? ";Hermione;Ron,Weasley,Snape,Goyle,suddenly,Harry,;0.0;3899;100
said Malfoy loudly a few minutes later , as Snape awarded Hufflepuff another penalty for no reason at all . " It 's people they feel sorry for . See , there 's Potter , who 's got no parents , then there 's the Weasleys , who 've got no money - you should be on the team , Longbottom , you 've got no brains . ";Snape;Potter,Weasley,;-0.233333333333;3900;100
" I 'm worth twelve of you , Malfoy , " he stammered .;Hermione;Ron,Weasley,Snape,Goyle,suddenly,Harry,;0.3;3902;100
Malfoy , Crabbe , and Goyle howled with laughter , but Ron , still not daring to take his eyes from the game , said , " You tell him , Neville . ";Goyle;Hermione,Ron,Weasley,Snape,suddenly,Harry,;-0.4;3903;100
" Longbottom , if brains were gold you'd be poorer than Weasley , and that 's saying something . ";Hermione;Ron,Weasley,Snape,Goyle,suddenly,Harry,;0.0;3904;100
" I 'm warning you , Malfoy - one more word - ";Ron;Hermione,Weasley,Snape,Goyle,suddenly,Harry,;0.5;3906;100
" Ron ! ";Hermione;Ron,Weasley,Snape,Goyle,suddenly,Harry,;0.0;3907;100
said Hermione suddenly , " Harry - ";suddenly;Hermione,Ron,Weasley,Snape,Goyle,Harry,;0.0;3908;100
" What ? Where ? ";Ron;Hermione,Weasley,Snape,Goyle,suddenly,Harry,;0.0;3909;100
" You 're in luck , Weasley , Potter 's obviously spotted some money on the ground ! ";Hermione;Ron,Weasley,Snape,Goyle,suddenly,Harry,;0.0;3912;100
" Come on , Harry ! ";Ron;Hermione,Weasley,Snape,Goyle,suddenly,Harry,;0.0;3917;100
" Ron ! Ron ! Where are you ? The game 's over ! Harry 's won ! We 've won ! Gryffindor is in the lead ! ";Hermione;Gryffindor,;-0.9765625;3921;100
" Well done , " said Dumbledore quietly , so that only Harry could hear . " Nice to see you have n't been brooding about that mirror...been keeping busy...excellent ... ";Harry;Hermione,Ron,Weasley,Snape,Goyle,suddenly,;0.3;3927;100
" ...d-do n't know why you wanted t-t-to meet here of all p-places , Severus ... ";Snape;;0.0;3956;101
" Oh , I thought we'd keep this private , " said Snape , his voice icy . " Students are n't supposed to know about the Sorcerer 's Stone , after all . ";Snape;;-0.05;3957;101
" Have you found out how to get past that beast of Hagrid 's yet ? ";Snape;;-0.25;3961;101
" B-b-but Severus , I - ";Snape;;0.0;3962;101
" You do n't want me as your enemy , Quirrell , " said Snape , taking a step toward him .;Snape;;0.0;3963;101
" I-I do n't know what you - ";Snape;;0.0;3964;101
" You know perfectly well what I mean . ";Snape;;-0.3125;3965;101
He steadied himself in time to hear Snape say , " - your little bit of hocus-pocus . I 'm waiting . ";Snape;;-0.1875;3967;101
" B-but I d-d-do n't - ";Snape;;0.0;3968;101
" Very well , " Snape cut in . " We 'll have another little chat soon , when you 've had time to think things over and decided where your loyalties lie . ";Snape;;0.00625;3969;101
" Harry , where have you been ? ";Hermione;Ron,breathlessly,;0.0;3973;102
" We won ! You won ! We won ! ";breathlessly;Hermione,Ron,;0.0;3975;102
shouted Ron , thumping Harry on the back . " And I gave Malfoy a black eye , and Neville tried to take on Crabbe and Goyle single-handed ! He 's still out cold but Madam Pomfrey says he 'll be all right - talk about showing Slytherin ! I 've waiting for you in the common room , we 're having a party , Fred and George stole some cakes and stuff from the kitchens . ";Ron;Neville,Pomfrey,Fred,Slytherin,;-0.190654761905;3976;102
" Never mind that now , " said Harry breathlessly . " Let 's find an empty room , you wait ' til you hear this ... ";breathlessly;Hermione,Ron,;-0.1;3977;102
" So we were right , it is the Sorcerer 's Stone , and Snape 's trying to force Quirrell to help him get it . He asked if he knew how to get past Fluffy - and he said something about Quirrell 's ' hocus pocus ' - I reckon there are other things guarding the stone apart from Fluffy , loads of enchantments , probably , and Quirrell would have done some anti-Dark Arts spell that Snape needs to break through - ";Ron;Quirrell,Snape,Sorcerer,Arts,;-0.0297619047619;3979;102
" So you mean the Stone 's only safe as long as Quirrell stands up to Snape ? ";breathlessly;Quirrell,;0.034375;3980;102
" It 'll be gone by next Tuesday , " said Ron .;Ron;Hermione,breathlessly,;0.0;3982;102
" Hermione , the exams are ages away . ";Ron;Hermione,Hagrid,Harry,;0.0;3996;103
" Ten weeks , " Hermione snapped . " That 's not ages , that 's like a second to Nicolas Flamel . ";Hermione;Ron,Hagrid,Harry,;0.0;3997;103
" But we 're not six hundred years old , " Ron reminded her . " Anyway , what are you studying for , you already know it 's an A. ";Ron;Hermione,Hagrid,Harry,;0.1;3998;103
" What am I studying for ? Are you crazy ? You realize we need to pass these exams to get into the second year ? They 're very important , I should have started studying a month ago , I do n't know what 's gotten into me ... ";Harry;Hermione,Ron,Hagrid,;-0.0266666666667;3999;103
" I 'll never remember this , " Ron burst out one afternoon , throwing down his quill and looking longingly out of the library window .;Hagrid;Hermione,Ron,Harry,;-0.155555555556;4004;103
Harry , who was looking up " Dittany " in One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi , did n't look up until he heard Ron say , " Hagrid ! What are you doing in the library ? ";Ron;Hermione,Hagrid,Harry,;0.625;4007;103
" Jus ' lookin ' , " he said , in a shifty voice that got their interest at once . " An ' what 're you lot up ter ? ";Harry;Hermione,Ron,Hagrid,;0.0;4010;103
He looked suddenly suspicious . " Yer not still lookin ' fer Nicolas Flamel , are yeh ? ";Hagrid;Hermione,Ron,Harry,;0.0;4011;103
" Oh , we found out who he is ages ago , " said Ron impressively . " And we know what that dog 's guarding , it 's a Sorcerer 's St - ";Ron;Sorcerer,;0.0;4012;103
" Shhhh ! ";Harry;Hermione,Ron,Hagrid,;0.0;4013;103
Hagrid looked around quickly to see if anyone was listening . " Don ' go shoutin ' about it , what 's the matter with yeh ? ";Hagrid;Hermione,Ron,Harry,;0.0;4014;103
" There are a few things we wanted to ask you , as a matter of fact , " said Harry , " about what 's guarding the Stone apart from Fluffy - ";Harry;Stone,;-0.2;4015;103
" SHHHH ! ";Ron;Hermione,Hagrid,Harry,;0.0;4016;103
said Hagrid again . " Listen - come an ' see me later , I 'm not promisin ' I 'll tell yeh anythin ' , mind , but don ' go rabbitin ' about it in here , students aren ' s'pposed ter know . They 'll think I 've told yeh - ";Hagrid;Hermione,Ron,Harry,;0.0;4017;103
" See you later , then , " said Harry .;Harry;Hermione,Ron,Hagrid,;0.0;4018;103
" What was he hiding behind his back ? ";Ron;Hermione,Hagrid,Harry,;-0.2;4020;103
" Do you think it had anything to do with the Stone ? ";Harry;Hermione,Ron,Hagrid,;0.0;4022;103
" I 'm going to see what section he was in , " said Ron , who'd had enough of working .;Ron;Hermione,Hagrid,Harry,;0.0;4023;103
" Dragons ! ";Harry;Hermione,Ron,Hagrid,;0.0;4025;103
he whispered . " Hagrid was looking up stuff about dragons ! Look at these : Dragon Species of Great Britain and Ireland ; From Egg to Inferno , A Dragon Keeper 's Guide . ";Ron;Hagrid,;0.8;4026;103
" Hagrid 's always wanted a dragon , he told me so the first time I ever met him , " said Harry .;Harry;Hermione,Ron,Hagrid,;0.25;4027;103
" But it 's against our laws , " said Ron . " Dragon breeding was outlawed by the Warlocks ' Convention of 1709 , everyone knows that . It 's hard to stop Muggles from noticing us if we 're keeping dragons in the back garden - anyway , you ca n't tame dragons , it 's dangerous . You should see the burns Charlie 's got off wild ones in Romania . ";Ron;Dragon,Muggles,Charlie,;-0.197916666667;4028;103
" But there are n't wild dragons in Britain ? ";Harry;Hermione,Ron,Hagrid,;0.1;4029;103
" Of course there are , " said Ron . " Common Welsh Green and Hebridean Blacks . The Ministry of Magic has a job hushing them up , I can tell you . Our kind have to keep putting spells on Muggles who 've spotted them , to make them forget . ";Ron;Magic,;0.15;4031;103
" So what on earth 's Hagrid up to ? ";Harry;Hermione,Ron,Hagrid,;0.0;4032;103
Hagrid called " Who is it ? ";Hagrid;Harry,Hermione,anxiously,Ron,;0.0;4036;104
" So - yeh wanted to ask me somethin ' ? ";Hermione;Hagrid,Harry,anxiously,Ron,;0.0;4041;104
" Yes , " said Harry .;Harry;Hagrid,Hermione,anxiously,Ron,;0.0;4042;104
There was no point beating around the bush . " We were wondering if you could tell us what 's guarding the Sorcerer 's Stone apart from Fluffy . ";Hagrid;Sorcerer,;0.0;4043;104
" O ' course I ca n't , " he said . " Number one , I don ' know meself . Number two , yeh know too much already , so I wouldn ' tell yeh if I could . That Stone 's here fer a good reason . It was almost stolen outta Gringotts - I s'ppose yeh 've worked that out an ' all ? Beats me how yeh even know abou ' Fluffy . ";Harry;Hagrid,Hermione,anxiously,Ron,;0.375;4045;104
" Oh , come on , Hagrid , you might not want to tell us , but you do know , you know everything that goes on round here , " said Hermione in a warm , flattering voice .;Hermione;Hagrid,Harry,anxiously,Ron,;0.2;4046;104
Hagrid 's beard twitched and they could tell he was smiling . " We only wondered who had done the guarding , really . ";Hagrid;Harry,Hermione,anxiously,Ron,;0.0;4047;104
Hermione went on . " We wondered who Dumbledore had trusted enough to help him , apart from you . ";Hermione;Dumbledore,;0.0;4048;104
" Well , I don ' s'pose it could hurt ter tell yeh that...let 's see...he borrowed Fluffy from me...then some o ' the teachers did enchantments...Professor Sprout - Professor Flitwick - Professor McGonagall - " he ticked them off on his fingers , " Professor Quirrell - an ' Dumbledore himself did somethin ' , o ' course . Hang on , I 've forgotten someone . Oh yeah , Professor Snape . ";Hagrid;Harry,Hermione,anxiously,Ron,;0.0;4051;104

" Yeah - yer not still on abou ' that , are yeh ? Look , Snape helped protect the Stone , he 's not about ter steal it . ";Harry;Snape,Stone,;0.0;4053;104
" You 're the only one who knows how to get past Fluffy . are n't you , Hagrid ? ";Hagrid;Harry,Hermione,anxiously,Ron,;-0.125;4057;104

" Not a soul knows except me an ' Dumbledore , " said Hagrid proudly .;Hagrid;Dumbledore,;0.0;4059;104
" Well , that 's something , " Harry muttered to the others . " Hagrid , can we have a window open ? I 'm boiling . ";Harry;Hagrid,Hermione,anxiously,Ron,;0.0;4060;104
" Ca n't , Harry , sorry , " said Hagrid .;Hagrid;Harry,Hermione,anxiously,Ron,;-0.5;4061;104
" Hagrid - what 's that ? ";Harry;Hagrid,Hermione,anxiously,Ron,;0.0;4064;104
" Ah , " said Hagrid , fiddling nervously with his beard , " That 's - er ... ";Hagrid;Harry,Hermione,anxiously,Ron,;0.0;4067;104
" Where did you get it , Hagrid ? ";Harry;Hagrid,Hermione,anxiously,Ron,;0.0;4068;104
said Ron , crouching over the fire to get a closer look at the egg . " It must 've cost you a fortune . ";Ron;Hagrid,Harry,Hermione,anxiously,;0.0;4069;104
" Won it , " said Hagrid . " Las ' night . I was down in the village havin ' a few drinks an ' got into a game o ' cards with a stranger . Think he was quite glad ter get rid of it , ter be honest . ";Hagrid;Harry,Hermione,anxiously,Ron,;0.0688888888889;4070;104
" But what are you going to do with it when it 's hatched ? ";Harry;Hagrid,Hermione,anxiously,Ron,;0.0;4071;104
" Well , I 've bin doin ' some readin ' , " said Hagrid , pulling a large book from under his pillow . " Got this outta the library - Dragon Breeding for Pleasure and Profit - it 's a bit outta date , o ' course , but it 's all in here . Keep the egg in the fire , ' cause their mothers breathe on I em , see , an ' when it hatches , feed it on a bucket o ' brandy mixed with chicken blood every half hour . An ' see here - how ter recognize diff ' rent eggs - what I got there 's a Norwegian Ridgeback . They 're rare , them . ";Hagrid;Ridgeback,;-0.0420634920635;4073;104
" Hagrid , you live in a wooden house , " she said .;Harry;Hagrid,Hermione,anxiously,Ron,;0.0681818181818;4075;104
" Wonder what it 's like to have a peaceful life , " Ron sighed , as evening after evening they struggled through all the extra homework they were getting .;Ron;Harry,;0.125;4080;105
" Hermione , how many times in our lives are we going to see a dragon hatching ? ";Ron;Harry,;0.5;4087;105
" We 've got lessons , we 'll get into trouble , and that 's nothing to what Hagrid 's going to be in when someone finds out what he 's doing - ";Ron;Harry,;0.0;4088;105
" Shut up ! ";Harry;Ron,;0.0;4089;105
" It 's nearly out . ";Ron;Harry,;0.0;4097;105
" Is n't he beautiful ? ";Hagrid;Hermione,Harry,;0.85;4109;106
" Bless him , look , he knows his mommy ! ";Harry;Hagrid,Hermione,;0.0;4113;106
" Hagrid , " said Hermione , " how fast do Norwegian Ridgebacks grow , exactly ? ";Hermione;Ridgeback,;0.1;4115;106
" What 's the matter ? ";Hagrid;Hermione,Harry,;0.0;4117;106
" Someone was lookin ' through the gap in the curtains - it 's a kid - he 's runnin ' back up ter the school . ";Harry;Hagrid,Hermione,;0.0;4118;106
" Just let him go , " Harry urged . " Set him free . ";Harry;Hagrid,Ron,;0.4;4125;107
" I ca n't , " said Hagrid . " He 's too little . He'd die . ";Hagrid;He'd,;-0.1875;4126;107
" I 've decided to call him Norbert , " said Hagrid , looking at the dragon with misty eyes . " He really knows me now , watch . Norbert ! Norbert ! Where 's Mommy ? ";Hagrid;Norbert,;0.0;4132;107
" He 's lost his marbles , " Ron muttered in Harry 's ear .;Ron;Harry,Hagrid,;0.0;4133;107
" Hagrid , " said Harry loudly , " give it two weeks and Norbert 's going to be as long as your house . Malfoy could go to Dumbledore at any moment . ";Harry;Malfoy,;-0.05;4134;107
" I - I know I ca n't keep him forever , but I ca n't jus ' dump him , I ca n't . ";Ron;Harry,Hagrid,;0.0;4136;107
Harry suddenly turned to Ron . " Charlie . ";Harry;Hagrid,Ron,;0.0;4137;107
" You 're losing it , too , " said Ron . " I 'm Ron , remember ? ";Ron;Ron,;0.0;4139;107
" No - Charlie - your brother , Charlie . In Romania . Studying dragons . We could send Norbert to him . Charlie can take care of him and then put him back in the wild ! ";Harry;Charlie,Norbert,;0.0625;4140;107
" Brilliant ! ";Hagrid;Harry,Ron,;1.0;4141;107
said Ron . " How about it , Hagrid ? ";Ron;Harry,Hagrid,;0.0;4142;107
" It bit me ! ";Hagrid;Harry,;0.0;4150;108
he said , showing them his hand , which was wrapped in a bloody handkerchief . " I 'm not going to be able to hold a quill for a week . I tell you , that dragon 's the most horrible animal I 've ever met , but the way Hagrid goes on about it , you'd think it was a fluffy little bunny rabbit . When it bit me he told me off for frightening it . And when I left , he was singing it a lullaby . ";Hagrid;way,;-0.2125;4151;108
" It 's Hedwig ! ";Hagrid;Hedwig,;0.0;4153;108
said Harry , hurrying to let her in . " She 'll have Charlie 's answer ! ";Harry;Charlie,;0.0;4154;108
" We 've got the invisibility cloak , " said Harry . " It should n't be too difficult - I think the cloaks big enough to cover two of us and Norbert . ";Harry;;-0.166666666667;4171;109
" It 's not just my hand , " he whispered , " although that feels like it 's about to fall off . Malfoy told Madam Pomfrey he wanted to borrow one of my books so he could come and have a good laugh at me . He kept threatening to tell her what really bit me - I 've told her it was a dog , but I do n't think she believes me - I should n't have hit him at the Quidditch match , that 's why he 's doing this . ";Hermione;Malfoy,;0.316666666667;4182;110
" It 'll all be over at midnight on Saturday , " said Hermione , but this did n't soothe Ron at all .;Hermione;Harry,;0.0;4184;110
" Midnight on Saturday ! ";Hermione;Harry,;0.0;4186;110
he said in a hoarse voice . " Oh no oh no - I 've just remembered - Charlie 's letter was in that book Malfoy took , he 's going to know we 're getting rid of Norbert . ";Harry;book,;0.0;4187;110
" It 's too late to change the plan now , " Harry told Hermione . " We have n't got time to send Charlie another owl , and this could be our only chance to get rid of Norbert . We 'll have to risk it . And we have got the invisibility cloak , Malfoy does n't know about that . ";Harry;Malfoy,;-0.15;4191;111
" I wo n't let you in , " he puffed . " Norbert 's at a tricky stage - nothin ' I ca n't handle . ";Harry;Norbert,;0.0;4193;111
" Aargh ! It 's all right , he only got my boot - jus ' playin ' - he 's only a baby , after all . ";Charlie;Harry,;0.0952380952381;4195;111
" He 's got lots o ' rats an ' some brandy fer the journey , " said Hagrid in a muffled voice . " An ' I 've packed his teddy bear in case he gets lonely . ";Hagrid;Professor,Hermione,Harry,;-0.1;4202;112
" Bye-bye , Norbert ! ";Professor;Hagrid,Hermione,Harry,;0.0;4204;112
Hagrid sobbed , as Harry and Hermione covered the crate with the invisibility cloak and stepped underneath it themselves . " Mommy will never forget you ! ";Hagrid;Mommy,;0.0;4205;112
" Nearly there ! ";Hermione;Hagrid,Professor,Harry,;0.0;4209;112
" Detention ! ";Professor;Hagrid,Hermione,Harry,;0.0;4215;112
she shouted . " And twenty points from Slytherin ! Wandering around in the middle of the night , how dare you - ";Hagrid;Professor,Hermione,Harry,;0.0;4216;112
" You do n't understand , Professor . Harry Potter 's coming - he 's got a dragon ! ";Professor;Hagrid,Hermione,Harry,;0.0;4217;112
" What utter rubbish ! How dare you tell such lies ! Come on - I shall see Professor Snape about you , Malfoy ! ";Hermione;Professor,;0.0;4218;112
" Malfoy 's got detention ! I could sing ! ";Hagrid;Professor,Hermione,Harry,;0.0;4222;112
" Do n't , " Harry advised her .;Harry;Hagrid,Professor,Hermione,;0.0;4223;112
" Well , well , well , " he whispered , " we are in trouble . ";They'd;;0.0;4234;113
" Harry ! ";Professor;Gryffindor,;0.0;4253;114
Neville burst out , the moment he saw the other two . " I was trying to find you to warn you , I heard Malfoy saying he was going to catch you , he said you had a drag - ";Professor;Malfoy,;-0.125;4254;114
" I would never have believed it of any of you . Mr. Filch says you were up in the astronomy tower . It 's one o'clock in the morning . Explain yourselves . ";Professor;Filch,;0.0;4257;114
" I think I 've got a good idea of what 's been going on , " said Professor McGonagall . " It does n't take a genius to work it out . You fed Draco Malfoy some cock-and-bull story about a dragon , trying to get him out of bed and into trouble . I 've already caught him . I suppose you think it 's funny that Longbottom here heard the story and believed it , too ? ";Professor;Longbottom,;0.45;4260;114
" I 'm disgusted , " said Professor McGonagall . " Four students out of bed in one night ! I 've never heard of such a thing before ! You , Miss Granger , I thought you had more sense . As for you , Mr. Potter , I thought Gryffindor meant more to you than this . All three of you will receive detentions - yes , you too , Mr. Longbottom , nothing gives you the right to walk around school at night , especially these days , it 's very dangerous - and fifty points will be taken from Gryffindor . ";Professor;Gryffindor,;-0.150969387755;4263;114
" Fifty ? ";Professor;Gryffindor,;0.0;4264;114
" Fifty points each , " said Professor McGonagall , breathing heavily through her long , pointed nose .;Professor;Gryffindor,;-0.05;4266;114
" Professor - please - ";Professor;Gryffindor,;0.0;4267;114
" You ca n't - ";Professor;Gryffindor,;0.0;4268;114
" Do n't tell me what I can and ca n't do , Potter . Now get back to bed , all of you . I 've never been more ashamed of Gryffindor students . ";Gryffindor;Professor,;0.25;4269;114
Slytherins , on the other hand , clapped as he walked past them , whistling and cheering , " Thanks Potter , we owe you one ! ";Slytherin;Ron,Wood,;-0.0729166666667;4287;115
" They 'll all forget this in a few weeks . Fred and George have lost loads of points in all the time they 've been here , and people still like them . ";Wood;Fred,;-0.2;4289;115
" They 've never lost a hundred and fifty points in one go , though , have they ? ";Slytherin;Ron,Wood,;0.0;4290;115
" Well - no , " Ron admitted .;Ron;Slytherin,Wood,;0.0;4292;115
" Resign ? ";Slytherin;Ron,Wood,;0.0;4296;115
Wood thundered . " What good 'll that do ? How are we going to get any points back if we ca n't win at Quidditch ? ";Wood;Slytherin,Ron,;0.483333333333;4297;115
The rest of the team would n't speak to Harry during practice , and if they had to speak about him , they called him " the Seeker . ";Ron;Slytherin,Wood,;0.0;4299;115
" No - no - not again , please - ";Quirrell;;0.0;4309;116
" All right - all right - " he heard Quirrell sob .;Quirrell;;0.285714285714;4312;116
" Snape 's done it , then ! ";Harry;Ron,Hermione,;0.0;4322;117
said Ron . " If Quirrell 's told him how to break his Anti-Dark Force spell - ";Ron;Force,;0.0;4323;117
" There 's still Fluffy , though , " said Hermione .;Hermione;Ron,Harry,;0.0;4324;117
" Maybe Snape 's found out how to get past him without asking Hagrid , " said Ron , looking up at the thousands of books surrounding them . " I bet there 's a book somewhere in here telling you how to get past a giant three-headed dog . So what do we do , Harry ? ";Ron;Hagrid,;-0.166666666667;4325;117
" Go to Dumbledore . That 's what we should have done ages ago . If we try anything ourselves we 'll be thrown out for sure . ";Harry;Ron,Hermione,;0.5;4327;117
" But we 've got no proof ! ";Ron;Hermione,Harry,;0.0;4328;117
said Harry . " Quirrell 's too scared to back us up . Snape 's only got to say he does n't know how the troll got in at Halloween and that he was nowhere near the third floor - who do you think they 'll believe , him or us ? It 's not exactly a secret we hate him , Dumbledore 'll think we made it up to get him sacked . Filch would n't help us if his life depended on it , he 's too friendly with Snape , and the more students get thrown out , the better , he 'll think . And do n't forget , we 're not supposed to know about the Stone or Fluffy . That 'll take a lot of explaining . ";Harry;Dumbledore,Filch,;0.0305555555556;4329;117
" If we just do a bit of poking around - ";Ron;Hermione,Harry,;0.0;4331;117
" No , " said Harry flatly , " we 've done enough poking around . ";Harry;Ron,Hermione,;0.0;4332;117
" Follow me , " said Filch , lighting a lamp and leading them outside .;Filch;Neville,Hagrid,Harry,Malfoy,Ron,Hermione,timidly,grumpily,;0.0;4348;118
" I bet you 'll think twice about breaking a school rule again , wo n't you , eh ? ";Hagrid;Filch,Neville,Harry,Malfoy,Ron,Hermione,timidly,grumpily,;0.0;4349;118
he said , leering at them . " Oh yes...hard work and pain are the best teachers if you ask me....It 's just a pity they let the old punishments die out...hang you by your wrists from the ceiling for a few days , I 've got the chains still in my office , keep ' em well oiled in case they 're ever needed...Right , off we go , and do n't think of running off , now , it 'll be worse for you if you do .

" Is that you , Filch ? Hurry up , I want ter get started . ";Hagrid;Filch,Neville,Harry,Malfoy,Ron,Hermione,timidly,grumpily,;0.0;4358;118
His relief must have showed in his face , because Filch said , " I suppose you think you 'll be enjoying yourself with that oaf ? Well , think again , boy - it 's into the forest you 're going and I 'm much mistaken if you 'll all come out in one piece . ";Filch;Neville,Hagrid,Harry,Malfoy,Ron,Hermione,timidly,grumpily,;0.3;4360;118
" The forest ? ";Hagrid;Filch,Neville,Harry,Malfoy,Ron,Hermione,timidly,grumpily,;0.0;4362;118
he repeated , and he did n't sound quite as cool as usual . " We ca n't go in there at night - there 's all sorts of things in there - werewolves , I heard . ";Neville;Filch,Hagrid,Harry,Malfoy,Ron,Hermione,timidly,grumpily,;0.166666666667;4363;118
" That 's your problem , is n't it ? ";Hagrid;Filch,Neville,Harry,Malfoy,Ron,Hermione,timidly,grumpily,;0.0;4365;118
said Filch , his voice cracking with glee . " Should 've thought of them werewolves before you got in trouble , should n't you ? ";Filch;Neville,Hagrid,Harry,Malfoy,Ron,Hermione,timidly,grumpily,;0.0;4366;118
" Abou ' time , " he said . " I bin waitin ' fer half an hour already . All right , Harry , Hermione ? ";Hagrid;Filch,Neville,Harry,Malfoy,Ron,Hermione,timidly,grumpily,;0.0595238095238;4369;118
" I should n't be too friendly to them , Hagrid , " said Filch coldly , they 're here to be punished , after all . ";Filch;Neville,Hagrid,Harry,Malfoy,Ron,Hermione,timidly,grumpily,;0.375;4370;118
" That 's why yer late , is it ? ";Ron;Filch,Neville,Hagrid,Harry,Malfoy,Hermione,timidly,grumpily,;-0.3;4371;118
said Hagrid , frowning at Filch . " Bin lecturin ' them , eh ? ' Snot your place ter do that . Yeh 've done yer bit , I 'll take over from here . ";Hagrid;Yeh,;0.0;4372;118
" I 'll be back at dawn , " said Filch , " for what 's left of them , " he added nastily , and he turned and started back toward the castle , his lamp bobbing away in the darkness .;Filch;Neville,Hagrid,Harry,Malfoy,Ron,Hermione,timidly,grumpily,;0.0;4373;118
" I 'm not going in that forest , " he said , and Harry was pleased to hear the note of panic in his voice .;Harry;Filch,Neville,Hagrid,Malfoy,Ron,Hermione,timidly,grumpily,;0.5;4375;118
" Yeh are if yeh want ter stay at Hogwarts , " said Hagrid fiercely . " Yeh 've done wrong an ' now yeh 've got ter pay fer it . ";Hagrid;Yeh,;-0.5;4376;118
" But this is servant stuff , it 's not for students to do . I thought we'd be copying lines or something , if my father knew I was doing this , he'd - ";Ron;Filch,Neville,Hagrid,Harry,Malfoy,Hermione,timidly,grumpily,;0.0;4377;118
" - tell yer that 's how it is at Hogwarts , " Hagrid growled . " Copyin ' lines ! What good 's that ter anyone ? Yeh 'll do summat useful or yeh 'll get out . If yeh think yer father'd rather you were expelled , then get back off ter the castle an ' pack . Go on . ";Hagrid;Yeh,;0.316666666667;4378;118
" Right then , " said Hagrid , " now , listen carefully , ' cause it 's dangerous what we 're gonna do tonight , an ' I don ' want no one takin ' risks . Follow me over here a moment . ";Hagrid;Filch,Neville,Harry,Malfoy,Ron,Hermione,timidly,grumpily,;-0.157142857143;4381;118
" Look there , " said Hagrid , " see that stuff shinin ' on the ground ? Silvery stuff ? That 's unicorn blood . There 's a unicorn in there bin hurt badly by summat .

" And what if whatever hurt the unicorn finds us first ? ";Ron;Filch,Neville,Hagrid,Harry,Malfoy,Hermione,timidly,grumpily,;0.25;4386;118
" There 's nothin ' that lives in the forest that 'll hurt yeh if yer with me or Fang , " said Hagrid . " An ' keep ter the path .

" I want Fang , " said Malfoy quickly , looking at Fang 's long teeth .;Malfoy;Fang,;-0.05;4389;118
" All right , but I warn yeh , he 's a coward , " said Hagrid . " So me , Harry , an ' Hermione 'll go one way an ' Draco , Neville , an ' Fang 'll go the other . Now , if any of us finds the unicorn , we 'll send up green sparks , right ?

" Well enough . Look , I 've jus ' bin askin ' Ronan , you seen anythin ' odd in here lately ? There 's a unicorn bin injured - would yeh know anythin ' about it ? ";Ron;Filch,Neville,Hagrid,Harry,Malfoy,Hermione,timidly,grumpily,;-0.0833333333333;4445;118
He looked skyward . " Mars is bright tonight , " he said simply .;Hagrid;Mars,;0.7;4447;118
" We 've heard , " said Hagrid grumpily . " Well , if either of you do see anythin ' , let me know , wo n't yeh ? We 'll be off , then . ";grumpily;Filch,Neville,Hagrid,Harry,Malfoy,Ron,Hermione,timidly,;0.0;4448;118
" Never , " said Hagrid irritably , " try an ' get a straight answer out of a centaur . Ruddy stargazers . Not interested in anythin ' closer'n the moon . ";Hagrid;Filch,Neville,Harry,Malfoy,Ron,Hermione,timidly,grumpily,;0.225;4450;118
" Are there many of them in here ? ";Ron;Filch,Neville,Hagrid,Harry,Malfoy,Hermione,timidly,grumpily,;0.5;4451;118
" Oh , a fair few....Keep themselves to themselves mostly , but they 're good enough about turnin ' up if ever I want a word . They 're deep , mind , centaurs...they know things...jus ' don ' let on much . ";Hermione;Filch,Neville,Hagrid,Harry,Malfoy,Ron,timidly,grumpily,;0.29;4453;118
" D'you think that was a centaur we heard earlier ? ";Hagrid;Filch,Neville,Harry,Malfoy,Ron,Hermione,timidly,grumpily,;0.0;4454;118
" Did that sound like hooves to you ? Nah , if yeh ask me , that was what 's bin killin ' the unicorns - never heard anythin ' like it before . ";Harry;Filch,Neville,Hagrid,Malfoy,Ron,Hermione,timidly,grumpily,;0.4;4456;118
" Hagrid ! Look ! Red sparks , the others are in trouble ! ";Hagrid;Red,;0.0;4462;118
" You two wait here ! ";Ron;Filch,Neville,Hagrid,Harry,Malfoy,Hermione,timidly,grumpily,;0.0;4463;118

" I do n't care if Malfoy has , but if something 's got Neville...it 's our fault he 's here in the first place . ";Hermione;Malfoy,Neville,;0.25;4468;118
" We 'll be lucky ter catch anythin ' now , with the racket you two were makin ' . Right , we 're changin ' groups - Neville , you stay with me an ' Hermione , Harry , you go with Fang an ' this idiot . I 'm sorry , " Hagrid added in a whisper to Harry , " but he 'll have a harder time frightenin ' you , an ' we 've gotta get this done . ";Hagrid;Hermione,;0.0047619047619;4479;119
" Look - " he murmured , holding out his arm to stop Malfoy .;Malfoy;Hagrid,;0.0;4485;119
" AAAAAAAAAARGH ! ";Malfoy;;0.0;4495;120
" Are you all right ? ";Harry;Bane,Firenze,Ron,Hagrid,;0.285714285714;4506;121
" Yes - thank you - what was that ? ";Firenze;Harry,Bane,Ron,Hagrid,;0.0;4508;121
" You are the Potter boy , " he said . " You had better get back to Hagrid . The forest is not safe at this time - especially for you . Can you ride ? It will be quicker this way .;Bane;Harry,Firenze,Ron,Hagrid,;0.25;4512;121
" My name is Firenze , " he added , as he lowered himself on to his front legs so that Harry could clamber onto his back .;Harry;Firenze,;0.0;4513;121
" Firenze ! ";Firenze;Harry,Bane,Ron,Hagrid,;0.0;4516;121
Bane thundered . " What are you doing ? You have a human on your back ! Have you no shame ? Are you a common mule ? ";Bane;Harry,Firenze,Ron,Hagrid,;-0.1;4517;121
" Do you realize who this is ? ";Harry;Bane,Firenze,Ron,Hagrid,;0.0;4518;121
said Firenze . " This is the Potter boy . The quicker he leaves this forest , the better . ";Firenze;Harry,Bane,Ron,Hagrid,;0.5;4519;121
" What have you been telling him ? ";Harry;Bane,Firenze,Ron,Hagrid,;0.0;4520;121
growled Bane . " Remember , Firenze , we are sworn not to set ourselves against the heavens . Have we not read what is to come in the movements of the planets ? ";Bane;Harry,Firenze,Ron,Hagrid,;0.0;4521;121
Ronan pawed the ground nervously . " I 'm sure Firenze thought he was acting for the best , " he said in his gloomy voice .;Ron;Firenze,;0.5;4522;121
" For the best ! What is that to do with us ? Centaurs are concerned with what has been foretold ! It is not our business to run around like donkeys after stray humans in our forest ! ";Firenze;Harry,Bane,Ron,Hagrid,;1.0;4524;121
" Do you not see that unicorn ? ";Harry;Bane,Firenze,Ron,Hagrid,;0.0;4526;121
Firenze bellowed at Bane . " Do you not understand why it was killed ? Or have the planets not let you in on that secret ? I set myself against what is lurking in this forest , Bane , yes , with humans alongside me if I must . ";Firenze;Harry,Bane,Ron,Hagrid,;-0.4;4527;121
" Why 's Bane so angry ? ";Harry;Bane,Firenze,Ron,Hagrid,;-0.5;4530;121
he asked . " What was that thing you saved me from , anyway ? ";Firenze;Harry,Bane,Ron,Hagrid,;0.0;4531;121
" Harry Potter , do you know what unicorn blood is used for ? ";Bane;Harry,Firenze,Ron,Hagrid,;0.0;4535;121
" No , " said Harry , startled by the odd question . " We 've only used the horn and tail hair in Potions . ";Harry;Bane,Firenze,Ron,Hagrid,;-0.0833333333333;4536;121
" That is because it is a monstrous thing , to slay a unicorn , " said Firenze . " Only one who has nothing to lose , and everything to gain , would commit such a crime . The blood of a unicorn will keep you alive , even if you are an inch from death , but at a terrible price . You have slain something pure and defenseless to save yourself , and you will have but a half-life , a cursed life , from the moment the blood touches your lips . ";Firenze;Harry,Bane,Ron,Hagrid,;-0.180952380952;4537;121
" But who'd be that desperate ? ";Harry;Bane,Firenze,Ron,Hagrid,;-0.6;4539;121
he wondered aloud . " If you 're going to be cursed forever , death 's better , is n't it ? ";Bane;Harry,Firenze,Ron,Hagrid,;0.5;4540;121
" It is , " Firenze agreed , " unless all you need is to stay alive long enough to drink something else - something that will bring you back to full strength and power - something that will mean you can never die . Mr. Potter , do you know what is hidden in the school at this very moment ? ";Firenze;Harry,Bane,Ron,Hagrid,;0.0151041666667;4541;121
" The Sorcerer 's Stone ! Of course - the Elixir of Life ! But I do n't understand who - ";Harry;Bane,Firenze,Ron,Hagrid,;0.0;4542;121
" Can you think of nobody who has waited many years to return to power , who has clung to life , awaiting their chance ? ";Firenze;Harry,Bane,Ron,Hagrid,;0.5;4543;121
Over the rustling of the trees , he seemed to hear once more what Hagrid had told him on the night they had met : " Some say he died . Codswallop , in my opinion . Dunno if he had enough human left in him to die . ";Hagrid;Harry,Bane,Firenze,Ron,;0.125;4545;121
" Do you mean , " Harry croaked , " that was Vol - ";Harry;Voldemort,;-0.3125;4546;121
" Harry ! Harry , are you all right ? ";Firenze;Harry,Bane,Ron,Hagrid,;0.285714285714;4547;121
" I 'm fine , " said Harry , hardly knowing what he was saying . " The unicorn 's dead , Hagrid , it 's in that clearing back there . ";Harry;Bane,Firenze,Ron,Hagrid,;0.0722222222222;4549;121
" This is where I leave you , " Firenze murmured as Hagrid hurried off to examine the unicorn . " You are safe now . ";Firenze;Harry,Bane,Ron,Hagrid,;0.5;4550;121
" Good luck , Harry Potter , " said Firenze . " The planets have been read wrongly before now , even by centaurs . I hope this is one of those times . ";Firenze;Harry,Bane,Ron,Hagrid,;0.65;4552;121
" Snape wants the stone for Voldemort...and Voldemort 's waiting in the forest...and all this time we thought Snape just wanted to get rich ... ";Harry;Snape,;0.2875;4561;122
" Stop saying the name ! ";Harry;;0.0;4562;122
" Firenze saved me , but he should n't have done so....Bane was furious...he was talking about interfering with what the planets say is going to happen....They must show that Voldemort 's coming back....Bane thinks Firenze should have let Voldemort kill me....I suppose that 's written in the stars as well . ";Harry;Firenze,;0.0;4565;122
" Will you stop saying the name ! ";Harry;;0.0;4566;122
" So all I 've got to wait for now is Snape to steal the Stone , " Harry went on feverishly , " then Voldemort will be able to come and finish me off ... Well , I suppose Bane 'll be happy . ";Harry;Snape,Voldemort,Bane,;0.65;4568;122
" Harry , everyone says Dumbledore 's the only one You-Know-Who was ever afraid of with Dumbledore around , You-Know-Who wo n't touch you . Anyway , who says the centaurs are right ? It sounds like fortune-telling to me , and Professor McGonagall says that 's a very imprecise branch of magic . ";Harry;Dumbledore,You-Know-Who,Professor,;0.0771428571429;4570;122
" That was far easier than I thought it would be , " said Hermione as they joined the crowds flocking out onto the sunny grounds .

The Weasley twins and Lee Jordan were tickling the tentacles of a giant squid , which was basking in the warm shallows . " No more studying , " Ron sighed happily , stretching out on the grass . " You could look more cheerful , Harry , we 've got a week before we find out how badly we 've done , there 's no need to worry yet .

" I wish I knew what this means ! ";Harry;Hermione,Lee,casually,Hagrid,Professor,Stone,Snape,Ron,briskly,;0.0;4601;123

" Go to Madam Pomfrey , " Hermione suggested .;Hermione;Lee,Harry,casually,Hagrid,Professor,Stone,Snape,Ron,briskly,;0.0;4603;123
" I 'm not ill , " said Harry . " I think it 's a warning...it means danger 's coming ... ";Harry;Hermione,Lee,casually,Hagrid,Professor,Stone,Snape,Ron,briskly,;-0.5;4604;123
" Harry , relax , Hermione 's right , the Stone 's safe as long as Dumbledore 's around . Anyway , we 've never had any proof Snape found out how to get past Fluffy . He nearly had his leg ripped off once , he 's not going to try it again in a hurry . And Neville will play Quidditch for England before Hagrid lets Dumbledore down . ";Professor;proof,Neville,Quidditch,;0.0660317460317;4606;123
When he tried to explain this , Hermione said , " That 's just the exams . I woke up last night and was halfway through my Transfiguration notes before I remembered we'd done that one . ";Hermione;Lee,Harry,casually,Hagrid,Professor,Stone,Snape,Ron,briskly,;0.0;4608;123

" Why ? ";Professor;Hermione,Lee,Harry,casually,Hagrid,Stone,Snape,Ron,briskly,;0.0;4619;123
" Do n't you think it 's a bit odd , " said Harry , scrambling up the grassy slope , " that what Hagrid wants more than anything else is a dragon , and a stranger turns up who just happens to have an egg in his pocket ? How many people wander around with dragon eggs if it 's against wizard law ? Lucky they found Hagrid , do n't you think ? Why did n't I see it before ? ";Harry;Hagrid,;0.273333333333;4621;123

" It 's not that unusual , yeh get a lot o ' funny folk in the Hog 's Head - that 's the pub down in the village . Mighta bin a dragon dealer , mightn ' he ? I never saw his face , he kept his hood up . ";Hermione;Lee,Harry,casually,Hagrid,Professor,Stone,Snape,Ron,briskly,;0.0981481481481;4630;123

" Mighta come up , " said Hagrid , frowning as he tried to remember .

" We 've got to go to Dumbledore , " said Harry .

Professor McGonagall repeated , as though this was a very fishy thing to want to do . " Why ? ";Professor;Hermione,Lee,Harry,casually,Hagrid,Stone,Snape,Ron,briskly,;0.2;4648;123

" Right , here 's what we 've got to do , " he whispered urgently . " One of us has got to keep an eye on Snape - wait outside the staff room and follow him if he leaves it .

If I get caught before I can get to the Stone , well , I 'll have to go back to the Dursleys and wait for Voldemort to find me there , it 's only dying a bit later than I would have , because I 'm never going over to the Dark Side !

Quirrell laughed , and it was n't his usual quivering treble , either , but cold and sharp . " Yes , Severus does seem the type , does n't he ?

Unfortunately , while everyone else was running around looking for it , Snape , who already suspected me , went straight to the third floor to head me off - and not only did my troll fail to beat you to death , that three-headed dog did n't even manage to bite Snape 's leg off properly .;quietly;Snape,;0.00952380952381;5101;128
" Now , wait quietly , Potter . I need to examine this interesting mirror . ";idly;Quirrell,quietly,Harry,;0.5;5102;128
" This mirror is the key to finding the Stone , " Quirrell murmured , tapping his way around the frame . " Trust Dumbledore to come up with something like this...but he 's in London...I 'll be far away by the time he gets back ... ";Quirrell;Stone,London,;0.0333333333333;5105;128
" I saw you and Snape in the forest - " he blurted out .;quietly;Snape,;0.0;5107;128
" Yes , " said Quirrell idly , walking around the mirror to look at the back . " He was on to me by that time , trying to find out how far I'd got . He suspected me all along . Tried to frighten me - as though he could , when I had Lord Voldemort on my side ... ";idly;I'd,Voldemort,;0.05;5108;128
" I see the Stone...I 'm presenting it to my master...but where is it ? ";Quirrell;Stone,;0.0;5110;128
" But Snape always seemed to hate me so much . ";quietly;always,;-0.35;5113;128
" Oh , he does , " said Quirrell casually , " heavens , yes . He was at Hogwarts with your father , did n't you know ? They loathed each other . But he never wanted you dead . ";Quirrell;idly,quietly,Harry,;-0.1625;5114;128
" But I heard you a few days ago , sobbing - I thought Snape was threatening you ... ";quietly;Snape,;-0.2;5115;128
" Sometimes , " he said , " I find it hard to follow my master 's instructions - he is a great wizard and I am weak - ";Quirrell;idly,quietly,Harry,;0.0444444444444;5117;128
" You mean he was there in the classroom with you ? ";idly;Quirrell,quietly,Harry,;-0.3125;5118;128
" He is with me wherever I go , " said Quirrell quietly . " I met him when I traveled around the world . A foolish young man I was then , full of ridiculous ideas about good and evil . Lord Voldemort showed me how wrong I was . There is no good and evil , there is only power , and those too weak to seek it...Since then , I have served him faithfully , although I have let him down many times . He has had to be very hard on me . ";quietly;Voldemort,;-0.11485042735;5120;128
Quirrell shivered suddenly . " He does not forgive mistakes easily . When I failed to steal the stone from Gringotts , he was most displeased . He punished me...decided he would have to keep a closer watch on me ... ";Quirrell;idly,quietly,Harry,;0.0;5121;128
" I do n't understand...is the Stone inside the mirror ? Should I break it ? ";quietly;Stone,;0.0;5126;128
" What does this mirror do ? How does it work ? Help me , Master ! ";Harry;Quirrell,idly,quietly,;0.0;5134;128
" Use the boy...Use the boy ... ";Quirrell;idly,quietly,Harry,;0.0;5136;128
" Yes - Potter - come here . ";quietly;Quirrell,idly,Harry,;0.0;5138;128
" Come here , " Quirrell repeated . " Look in the mirror and tell me what you see . ";Quirrell;idly,quietly,Harry,;0.0;5141;128
" Well ? ";Quirrell;Harry,;0.0;5153;129
said Quirrell impatiently . " What do you see ? ";Quirrell;Harry,;0.0;5154;129
" I see myself shaking hands with Dumbledore , " he invented . " I - I 've won the house cup for Gryffindor . ";Quirrell;Harry,;0.0;5156;129
" Get out of the way , " he said .;Quirrell;Harry,;0.0;5158;129
" He lies...He lies ... ";Quirrell;Harry,;0.0;5162;129
" Potter , come back here ! ";Quirrell;Harry,;0.0;5163;129
Quirrell shouted . " Tell me the truth ! What did you just see ? ";Quirrell;Harry,;0.0;5164;129
" Let me speak to him...face-to-face ... ";Quirrell;Harry,;0.0;5166;129
" Master , you are not strong enough ! ";Quirrell;Harry,;0.270833333333;5167;129
" I have strength enough...for this ... ";Harry;Quirrell,;0.0;5168;129
" Harry Potter ... ";Harry;Quirrell,;0.0;5179;130
" See what I have become ? ";Harry;Quirrell,;0.0;5182;130
the face said . " Mere shadow and vapor....I have form only when I can share another 's body...but there have always been those willing to let me into their hearts and minds...Unicorn blood has strengthened me , these past weeks...you saw faithful Quirrell drinking it for me in the forest...and once I have the Elixir of Life , I will be able to create a body of my own....Now...why do n't you give me that Stone in your pocket ? ";Harry;Stone,;0.0;5183;130
" Do n't be a fool , " snarled the face . " Better save your own life and join me...or you 'll meet the same end as your parents...They died begging me for mercy ... ";Harry;Better,;0.366666666667;5187;130
" LIAR ! ";Harry;Quirrell,;0.0;5188;130
" How touching ... ";Harry;Quirrell,;0.5;5192;130
it hissed . " I always value bravery....Yes , boy , your parents were brave...I killed your father first ; and he put up a courageous fight...but your mother need n't have died...she was trying to protect you...Now give me the Stone , unless you want her to have died in vain . ";Harry;Stone,;0.25;5193;130
" NEVER ! ";Harry;Quirrell,;0.0;5194;130
Harry sprang toward the flame door , but Voldemort screamed " SEIZE HIM ! ";Harry;Quirrell,;0.0;5195;130
" Seize him ! SEIZE HIM ! ";Harry;Quirrell,;0.0;5199;130
" Master , I cannot hold him - my hands - my hands ! ";Harry;Quirrell,;0.0;5201;130
" Then kill him , fool , and be done ! ";Harry;Quirrell,;0.0;5203;130
" AAAARGH ! ";Harry;Quirrell,;0.0;5206;130
Quirrell screamed and tried to throw Harry off - the pain in Harry 's head was building - he could n't see - he could only hear Quirrell 's terrible shrieks and Voldemort 's yells of , " KILL HIM ! KILL HIM ! ";Quirrell;Harry,;-0.78125;5209;130
and other voices , maybe in Harry 's own head , crying , " Harry ! Harry ! ";Harry;Quirrell,;0.143229166667;5210;130
" Good afternoon , Harry , " said Dumbledore .;Dumbledore;blankly,Harry,dreamily,;0.65;5223;131
Then he remembered : " Sir ! The Stone ! It was Quirrell ! He 's got the Stone ! Sir , quick - ";Harry;Quirrell,;0.333333333333;5225;131
" Calm yourself , dear boy , you are a little behind the times , " said Dumbledore . " Quirrell does not have the Stone . ";Dumbledore;Quirrell,;-0.0958333333333;5226;131
" Then who does ? Sir , I - ";Harry;Dumbledore,blankly,dreamily,;0.0;5227;131
" Harry , please relax , or Madam Pomfrey will have me thrown out . ";blankly;Pomfrey,;0.0;5228;131
" Tokens from your friends and admirers , " said Dumbledore , beaming . " What happened down in the dungeons between you and Professor Quirrell is a complete secret , so , naturally , the whole school knows . I believe your friends Misters Fred and George Weasley were responsible for trying to send you a toilet seat . No doubt they thought it would amuse you . Madam Pomfrey , however , felt it might not be very hygienic , and confiscated it . ";Dumbledore;Professor,Fred,;0.0240740740741;5232;131
" How long have I been in here ? ";Harry;Dumbledore,blankly,dreamily,;-0.05;5233;131
" Three days . Mr. Ronald Weasley and Miss Granger will be most relieved you have come round , they have been extremely worried . ";Dumbledore;Ron,;0.15;5234;131
" But sir , the Stone - ";Harry;Dumbledore,blankly,dreamily,;0.0;5235;131
" I see you are not to be distracted . Very well , the Stone . Professor Quirrell did not manage to take it from you . I arrived in time to prevent that , although you were doing very well on your own , I must say . ";Dumbledore;Quirrell,;0.333333333333;5236;131
" You got there ? You got Hermione 's owl ? ";Harry;Hermione,;0.0;5237;131
" We must have crossed in midair . No sooner had I reached London than it became clear to me that the place I should be was the one I had just left . I arrived just in time to pull Quirrell off you . ";Dumbledore;London,Quirrell,;0.05;5238;131
" It was you . ";Harry;Dumbledore,blankly,dreamily,;0.0;5239;131
" I feared I might be too late . ";Dumbledore;blankly,Harry,dreamily,;-0.3;5240;131
" You nearly were , I could n't have kept him off the Stone much longer - ";Harry;Stone,;0.1;5241;131
" Not the Stone , boy , you - the effort involved nearly killed you . For one terrible moment there , I was afraid it had . As for the Stone , it has been destroyed . ";Dumbledore;blankly,Harry,dreamily,;-0.8;5242;131
" Destroyed ? ";Harry;Dumbledore,blankly,dreamily,;0.0;5243;131
said Harry blankly . " But your friend - Nicolas Flamel - ";blankly;Dumbledore,Harry,dreamily,;0.0;5244;131
" Oh , you know about Nicolas ? ";Harry;Dumbledore,blankly,dreamily,;0.0;5245;131
said Dumbledore , sounding quite delighted . " You did do the thing properly , did n't you ? Well , Nicolas and I have had a little chat , and agreed it 's all for the best . ";Dumbledore;blankly,Harry,dreamily,;0.504166666667;5246;131
" But that means he and his wife will die , wo n't they ? ";Harry;Dumbledore,blankly,dreamily,;0.0;5247;131
" They have enough Elixir stored to set their affairs in order and then , yes , they will die . ";Dumbledore;blankly,Harry,dreamily,;0.0;5248;131
" To one as young as you , I 'm sure it seems incredible , but to Nicolas and Perenelle , it really is like going to bed after a very , very long day . After all , to the well-organized mind , death is but the next great adventure . You know , the Stone was really not such a wonderful thing . As much money and life as you could want ! The two things most human beings would choose above all - the trouble is , humans do have a knack of choosing precisely those things that are worst for them . ";Harry;Stone,;0.19125;5250;131
" Sir ? ";Dumbledore;blankly,Harry,dreamily,;0.0;5253;131
said Harry . " I 've been thinking...sir - even if the Stone 's gone , Vol - , I mean , You-Know-Who - ";Harry;Dumbledore,blankly,dreamily,;-0.3125;5254;131
" Call him Voldemort , Harry . Always use the proper name for things . Fear of a name increases fear of the thing itself . ";Dumbledore;Voldemort,;0.0;5255;131
" Yes , sir . Well , Voldemort 's going to try other ways of coming back , is n't he ? I mean , he has n't gone , has he ? ";blankly;Dumbledore,Harry,dreamily,;-0.145833333333;5256;131
" No , Harry , he has not . He is still out there somewhere , perhaps looking for another body to share...not being truly alive , he cannot be killed . He left Quirrell to die ; he shows just as little mercy to his followers as his enemies . Nevertheless , Harry , while you may only have delayed his return to power , it will merely take someone else who is prepared to fight what seems a losing battle next time - and if he is delayed again , and again , why , he may never return to power . ";Harry;Quirrell,;-0.0175;5257;131
Then he said , " Sir , there are some other things I'd like to know , if you can tell me...things I want to know the truth about ... ";Dumbledore;I'd,;-0.125;5259;131
" The truth . ";Harry;Dumbledore,blankly,dreamily,;0.0;5260;131
Dumbledore sighed . " It is a beautiful and terrible thing , and should therefore be treated with great caution . However , I shall answer your questions unless I have a very good reason not to , in which case I beg you 'll forgive me . I shall not , of course , lie . ";Dumbledore;blankly,Harry,dreamily,;0.37375;5261;131
" Well...Voldemort said that he only killed my mother because she tried to stop him from killing me . But why would he want to kill me in the first place ? ";Harry;Well...Voldemort,;0.125;5262;131
" Alas , the first thing you ask me , I cannot tell you . Not today . Not now . You will know , one day...put it from your mind for now , Harry . When you are older...I know you hate to hear this...when you are ready , you will know . ";Dumbledore;blankly,Harry,dreamily,;-0.1875;5264;131
" But why could n't Quirrell touch me ? ";Harry;Dumbledore,blankly,dreamily,;0.0;5266;131
" Your mother died to save you . If there is one thing Voldemort cannot understand , it is love . He did n't realize that love as powerful as your mother 's for you leaves its own mark . Not a scar , no visible sign...to have been loved so deeply , even though the person who loved us is gone , will give us some protection forever . It is in your very skin . Quirrell , full of hatred , greed , and ambition , sharing his soul with Voldemort , could not touch you for this reason . It was agony to touch a person marked by something so good . ";Dumbledore;Voldemort,;0.46;5267;131
When he had found his voice again , Harry said , " And the invisibility cloak - do you know who sent it to me ? ";Harry;Dumbledore,blankly,dreamily,;0.0;5269;131
" Ah - your father happened to leave it in my possession , and I thought you might like it . ";blankly;Dumbledore,Harry,dreamily,;0.0;5270;131
Dumbledore 's eyes twinkled . " Useful things...your father used it mainly for sneaking off to the kitchens to steal food when he was here . ";Dumbledore;blankly,Harry,dreamily,;0.3;5271;131
" And there 's something else ... ";Harry;Dumbledore,blankly,dreamily,;0.0;5272;131
" Fire away . ";Dumbledore;blankly,Harry,dreamily,;0.0;5273;131
" Quirrell said Snape - ";Harry;Quirrell,;0.0;5274;131
" Professor Snape , Harry . ";Dumbledore;blankly,Harry,dreamily,;0.0;5275;131
" Yes , him - Quirrell said he hates me because he hated my father . Is that true ? ";Harry;Quirrell,;-0.275;5276;131
" Well , they did rather detest each other . Not unlike yourself and Mr. Malfoy . And then , your father did something Snape could never forgive . ";Dumbledore;Snape,;-0.125;5277;131
" What ? ";Harry;Dumbledore,blankly,dreamily,;0.0;5278;131
" He saved his life . ";Dumbledore;blankly,Harry,dreamily,;0.0;5279;131
" What ? ";Harry;Dumbledore,blankly,dreamily,;0.0;5280;131
" Yes ... ";Dumbledore;blankly,Harry,dreamily,;0.0;5281;131
said Dumbledore dreamily . " Funny , the way people 's minds work , is n't it ? Professor Snape could n't bear being in your father 's debt...I do believe he worked so hard to protect you this year because he felt that would make him and your father even . Then he could go back to hating your father 's memory in peace ... ";dreamily;Professor,;-0.0138888888889;5282;131
" And sir , there 's one more thing ... ";Dumbledore;blankly,Harry,dreamily,;0.5;5284;131
" Just the one ? ";Harry;Dumbledore,blankly,dreamily,;0.0;5285;131
" How did I get the Stone out of the mirror ? ";Dumbledore;Stone,;0.0;5286;131
" Ah , now , I 'm glad you asked me that . It was one of my more brilliant ideas , and between you and me , that 's saying something . You see , only one who wanted to find the Stone - find it , but not use it - would be able to get it , otherwise they'd just see themselves making gold or drinking Elixir of Life . My brain surprises even me sometimes...Now , enough questions . I suggest you make a start on these sweets . Ah ! Bettie Bott 's Every Flavor Beans ! I was unfortunate enough in my youth to come across a vomit flavored one , and since then I 'm afraid I 've rather lost my liking for them - but I think I 'll be safe with a nice toffee , do n't you ? ";Harry;Bott,Stone,;0.24375;5287;131
Then he choked and said , " Alas ! Ear wax ! ";Dumbledore;blankly,Harry,dreamily,;-0.625;5289;131
" Just five minutes , " Harry pleaded .;Harry;Ron,Hermione,proudly,;0.0;5292;132
" Absolutely not . ";Ron;Harry,Hermione,proudly,;0.0;5293;132
" You let Professor Dumbledore in ... ";Hermione;Dumbledore,;0.0;5294;132
" Well , of course , that was the headmaster , quite different . You need rest . ";Ron;Harry,Hermione,proudly,;0.0;5295;132
" I am resting , look , lying down and everything . Oh , go on , Madam Pomfrey ... ";Hermione;Harry,Ron,proudly,;-0.155555555556;5296;132
" Oh , very well , " she said . " But five minutes only . ";Ron;Harry,Hermione,proudly,;0.1;5297;132
" Harry ! ";Hermione;Harry,Ron,proudly,;0.0;5299;132
" Oh , Harry , we were sure you were going to - Dumbledore was so worried - ";Harry;Dumbledore,;0.5;5301;132
" The whole school 's talking about it , " said Ron . " What really happened ? ";Ron;Harry,Hermione,proudly,;0.1;5302;132
" So the Stone 's gone ? ";Hermione;Harry,Ron,proudly,;0.0;5306;132
said Ron finally . " Flamel 's just going to die ? ";Ron;Harry,Hermione,proudly,;0.0;5307;132
" That 's what I said , but Dumbledore thinks that - what was it ? - ' to the well-organized mind , death is but the next great adventure . ' ";Hermione;Dumbledore,;0.4;5308;132
" I always said he was off his rocker , " said Ron , looking quite impressed at how crazy his hero was .;Ron;Harry,Hermione,proudly,;0.2;5309;132
" So what happened to you two ? ";Harry;Ron,Hermione,proudly,;0.0;5310;132
" Well , I got back all right , " said Hermione . " I brought Ron round - that took a while - and we were dashing up to the owlery to contact Dumbledore when we met him in the entrance hall - he already knew - he just said , ' Harry 's gone after him , has n't he ? ' and hurtled off to the third floor . ";Hermione;Dumbledore,;0.0214285714286;5312;132
" D'you think he meant you to do it ? ";Harry;Ron,Hermione,proudly,;0.0;5313;132
said Ron . " Sending you your father 's cloak and everything ? ";Ron;Harry,Hermione,proudly,;0.0;5314;132
" Well , " Hermione exploded , " if he did - I mean to say that 's terrible - you could have been killed . ";Hermione;Harry,Ron,proudly,;-0.65625;5315;132
" No , it is n't , " said Harry thoughtfully . " He 's a funny man , Dumbledore . I think he sort of wanted to give me a chance . I think he knows more or less everything that goes on here , you know . I reckon he had a pretty good idea we were going to try , and instead of stopping us , he just taught us enough to help . I do n't think it was an accident he let me find out how the mirror worked . It 's almost like he thought I had the right to face Voldemort if I could ... ";Harry;Voldemort,;0.252721088435;5316;132
" Yeah , Dumbledore 's off his rocker , all right , " said Ron proudly . " Listen , you 've got to be up for the end-of-year feast tomorrow . The points are all in and Slytherin won , of course - you missed the last Quidditch match , we were steamrollered by Ravenclaw without you - but the food 'll be good . ";proudly;Slytherin,last,;0.311904761905;5317;132
" You 've had nearly fifteen minutes , now OUT " she said firmly .;Ron;Harry,Hermione,proudly,;0.0;5319;132
I want to go to the feast , " he told Madam Pomfrey as she straightened his many candy boxes . I can , ca n't I ? ";Hagrid;Pomfrey,;0.5;5322;133
" Professor Dumbledore says you are to be allowed to go , " she said stiffly , as though in her opinion Professor Dumbledore did n't realize how risky feasts could be . " And you have another visitor . ";Dumbledore;Dumbledore,;0.0;5323;133
" Oh , good , " said Harry . " Who is it ? ";Harry;Dumbledore,Muggles,Hagrid,anxiously,;0.65;5324;133
" It 's - all - my - ruddy - fault ! ";Hagrid;Dumbledore,Harry,Muggles,anxiously,;0.0;5328;133
I should be chucked out an ' made ter live as a Muggle ! ";Muggles;Dumbledore,Harry,Hagrid,anxiously,;0.170454545455;5336;133
" Hagrid ! ";Harry;Dumbledore,Muggles,Hagrid,anxiously,;0.0;5337;133
said Harry , shocked to see Hagrid shaking with grief and remorse , great tears leaking down into his beard . " Hagrid , he'd have found out somehow , this is Voldemort we 're talking about , he'd have found out even if you had n't told him . ";Hagrid;Dumbledore,Harry,Muggles,anxiously,;-0.213888888889;5338;133
" Yeh could 've died ! ";Harry;Yeh,;0.0;5339;133
sobbed Hagrid . " An ' don ' say the name ! ";Hagrid;Dumbledore,Harry,Muggles,anxiously,;0.0;5340;133
" VOLDEMORT ! ";Muggles;Dumbledore,Harry,Hagrid,anxiously,;0.0;5341;133
Harry bellowed , and Hagrid was so shocked , he stopped crying . " I 've met him and I 'm calling him by his name . Please cheer up , Hagrid , we saved the Stone , it 's gone , he ca n't use it . Have a Chocolate Frog , I 've got loads ... ";Harry;Stone,;-0.45;5342;133
Hagrid wiped his nose on the back of his hand and said , " That reminds me . I 've got yeh a present . ";Hagrid;Dumbledore,Harry,Muggles,anxiously,;0.0;5343;133
" It 's not a stoat sandwich , is it ? ";Harry;Dumbledore,Muggles,Hagrid,anxiously,;0.0;5344;133
" Nah . Dumbledore gave me the day off yesterday ter fix it . ' course , he shoulda sacked me instead - anyway , got yeh this ... ";anxiously;Dumbledore,;0.0;5346;133
" Sent owls off ter all yer parents ' old school friends , askin ' fer photos...knew yeh didn ' have any...d'yeh like it ? ";Hagrid;Dumbledore,Harry,Muggles,anxiously,;0.1;5351;133
" Another year gone ! ";Dumbledore;Percy,;0.0;5362;134
Dumbledore said cheerfully . " And I must trouble you with an old man 's wheezing waffle before we sink our teeth into our delicious feast . What a year it has been ! Hopefully your heads are all a little fuller than they were...you have the whole summer ahead to get them nice and empty before next year starts ...;Dumbledore;Percy,;0.233928571429;5363;134
" Now , as I understand it , the house cup here needs awarding , and the points stand thus : In fourth place , Gryffindor , with three hundred and twelve points ; in third , Hufflepuff , with three hundred and fifty-two ; Ravenclaw has four hundred and twenty-six and Slytherin , four hundred and seventy-two . ";Dumbledore;Ravenclaw,Slytherin,;0.0;5364;134
" Yes , Yes , well done , Slytherin , " said Dumbledore . " However , recent events must be taken into account . ";Dumbledore;Percy,;0.0;5368;134
" Ahem , " said Dumbledore . " I have a few last-minute points to dish out . Let me see . Yes ...;Dumbledore;Percy,;-0.2;5371;134
" First - to Mr. Ronald Weasley ... ";Dumbledore;Percy,;0.25;5372;134
" ...for the best-played game of chess Hogwarts has seen in many years , I award Gryffindor house fifty points . ";Dumbledore;Hogwarts,;0.05;5374;134
Percy could be heard telling the other prefects , " My brother , you know ! My youngest brother ! Got past McGonagall 's giant chess set ! ";Percy;past,;-0.185546875;5376;134
" Second - to Miss Hermione Granger...for the use of cool logic in the face of fire , I award Gryffindor house fifty points . ";Dumbledore;Percy,;0.175;5378;134
" Third - to Mr. Harry Potter ... ";Dumbledore;Percy,;0.0;5381;134
The room went deadly quiet . " ...for pure nerve and outstanding courage , I award Gryffindor house sixty points . ";Dumbledore;Percy,;-0.0297619047619;5383;134
" There are all kinds of courage , " said Dumbledore , smiling . " It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies , but just as much to stand up to our friends . I therefore award ten points to Mr. Neville Longbottom . ";Dumbledore;Percy,;0.3;5389;134
" Which means , " Dumbledore called over the storm of applause , for even Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff were celebrating the downfall of Slytherin , " we need a little change of decoration . ";Dumbledore;Percy,;-0.1875;5394;134
And suddenly , their wardrobes were empty , their trunks were packed , Neville 's toad was found lurking in a corner of the toilets ; notes were handed out to all students , warning them not to use magic over the holidays ( " I always hope they 'll forget to give us these , " said Fred Weasley sadly ) ; Hagrid was there to take them down to the fleet of boats that sailed across the lake ; they were boarding the Hogwarts Express ; talking and laughing as the countryside became greener and tidier ; eating Bettie Bott 's Every Flavor Beans as they sped past Muggle towns ; pulling off their wizard robes and putting on jackets and coats ; pulling into platform nine and three-quarters at King 's Cross Station .;Hagrid;Ron,Harry,Hermione,Weasley,Uncle,;-0.00111111111111;5408;135
" You must come and stay this summer , " said Ron , " both of you - I 'll send you an owl . ";Ron;Hagrid,Harry,Hermione,Weasley,Uncle,;0.0;5411;135
" Thanks , " said Harry , " I 'll need something to look forward to . ";Harry;Hagrid,Ron,Hermione,Weasley,Uncle,;0.2;5412;135
