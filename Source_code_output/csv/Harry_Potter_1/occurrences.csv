" And finally , bird-watchers everywhere have reported that the nation 's owls have been behaving very unusually today .

" Right , " said Wood . " Now , Quidditch is easy enough to understand , even if it 's not too easy to play . There are seven players on each side . Three of them are called Chasers . ";Wood,;Quidditch,it,them,seven players,Chasers,;0.288095238095;2894;70
" Three Chasers , " Harry repeated , as Wood took out a bright red ball about the size of a soccer ball .;Harry,Wood,;;0.35;2895;70
" This ball 's called the Quaffle , " said Wood . " The Chasers throw the Quaffle to each other and try and get it through one of the hoops to score a goal .

" What 's basketball ? ";;basketball,;0.0;2898;70
" Never mind , " said Harry quickly .;Harry quickly,;;0.0;2900;70

" I 'll show you now , " said Wood . " Take this . ";Wood,;I,you,;0.0;2904;70

" See ? ";;;0.0;2913;70
Wood panted , forcing the struggling Bludger back into the crate and strapping it down safely . " The Bludgers rocket around , trying to knock players off their brooms . That 's why you have two Beaters on each team - the Weasley twins are ours - it 's their job to protect their side from the Bludgers and try and knock them toward the other team .

" Er - have the Bludgers ever killed anyone ? ";;the Bludgers ever,the Bludgers ever,anyone,;0.0;2917;70
" Never at Hogwarts . We 've had a couple of broken jaws but nothing worse than that . Now , the last member of the team is the Seeker . That 's you .

" Do n't worry , the Weasleys are more than a match for the Bludgers - I mean , they 're like a pair of human Bludgers themselves . ";;the Weasleys,I,they,;0.0625;2921;70
" This , " said Wood , " is the Golden Snitch , and it 's the most important ball of the lot . It 's very hard to catch because it 's so fast and difficult to see . It 's the Seeker 's job to catch it . You 've got to weave in and out of the Chasers , Beaters , Bludgers , and Quaffle to get it before the other team 's Seeker , because whichever Seeker catches the Snitch wins his team an extra hundred and fifty points , so they nearly always win . That 's why Seekers get fouled so much . A game of Quidditch only ends when the Snitch is caught , so it can go on for ages - I think the record is three months , they had to keep bringing on substitutes so the players could get some sleep .;Wood,;it,It,it,It,You,it,the Snitch,his,they,Seekers,Quidditch only,the Snitch,it,I,the record,they,the players,the Golden Snitch,the most important ball,the Seeker,it,it,the other team,the Snitch,his,the record,three months,;0.0919871794872;2925;70
