" The Watch has no shortage of stableboys , " Lord Mormont grumbled . " That seems to be all they send us these days . Stableboys and sneak thieves and rapers .

" On the wrong side , " Ser Jaremy Rykker commented dryly . " I ought to know , I was there on the battlements beside him . Tywin Lannister gave us a splendid choice .

" None taken , Ser Jaremy . My father is very fond of spiked heads , especially those of people who have annoyed him in some fashion .

Much later , when the serious business of eating was done and the others had left , Mormont offered Tyrion a chair beside the fire and a cup of mulled spirits so strong they brought tears to his eyes .

There was a pounding at her door , louder than before . " Arya Stark , you open this door at once , do you hear me ? ";;you,you,this door,you,me,;-0.1;4719;152

" You will rue this insolent behavior , young lady , I promise you that . ";;You,I,this insolent behavior,you,;0.1;4726;152
A soft knock at the door behind her turned Arya away from the window and her dreams of escape . " Arya , " her father 's voice called out . " Open the door . We need to talk . ";her,voice,Arya away,;We,;-0.1;4734;153

Lord Eddard Stark sighed . " My nine-year-old daughter is being armed from my own forge , and I know nothing of it .

Arya heard sadness in his voice ; he did not often speak of his father , or of the brother and sister who had died before she was born .

" If truth be told , the Hand had not seemed quite himself for some time , " Pycelle said .

Those broad shoulders were weighed down by all the cares of the realm , and more besides . His son was ever sickly , and his lady wife so anxious that she would scarcely let the boy out of her sight . It was enough to weary even a strong man , and the Lord Jon was not young .

Their gods were the gods of the forest , stream , and stone , the old gods whose names are secret .

No doubt the children were as frightened by the horses as the First Men were by the faces in the trees . As the First Men carved out holdfasts and farms , they cut down the faces and gave them to the fire . Horror-struck , the children went to war .
