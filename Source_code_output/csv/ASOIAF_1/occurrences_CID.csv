" We should start back , " Gared urged as the woods began to grow dark around them .;Gared;Serrett,Royce,;-0.075;2;0
" The wildlings are dead . ";Royce;Gared,Serrett,;-0.2;3;0
" Do the dead frighten you ? ";Serrett;Gared,Royce,;-0.2;4;0
He was an old man , past fifty , and he had seen the lordlings come and go . " Dead is dead , " he said . " We have no business with the dead . ";Gared;Dead,;-0.15;7;0
" Are they dead ? ";Serrett;Gared,Royce,;-0.2;8;0
Royce asked softly . " What proof have we ? ";Royce;Gared,Serrett,;0.0;9;0
" Will saw them , " Gared said . " If he says they are dead , that 's proof enough for me . ";Gared;Serrett,Royce,;-0.1;10;0
He wished it had been later rather than sooner . " My mother told me that dead men sing no songs , " he put in .;Serrett;Gared,Royce,;-0.1;12;0
" My wet nurse said the same thing , Will , " Royce replied . " Never believe anything you hear at a woman 's tit . There are things to be learned even from the dead . ";Royce;Gared,Serrett,;-0.1;13;0
" We have a long ride before us , " Gared pointed out . " Eight days , maybe nine . And night is falling . ";Gared;Serrett,Royce,;-0.05;15;0
Ser Waymar Royce glanced at the sky with disinterest . " It does that every day about this time . Are you unmanned by the dark , Gared ? ";Serrett;Gared,Royce,;-0.15;16;0
His cloak was his crowning glory ; sable , thick and black and soft as sin . " Bet he killed them all himself , he did , " Gared told the barracks over wine , " twisted their little heads off , our mighty warrior . ";Gared;Mallister,Royce,Frost,Waymar,;-0.109027777778;44;1
" Mormont said as we should track them , and we did , " Gared said . " They 're dead . They sha n't trouble us no more . There 's hard riding before us . I do n't like this weather . If it snows , we could be a fortnight getting back , and snow 's the best we can hope for . Ever seen an ice storm , my lord ? ";Gared;Mormont,;0.201666666667;48;1
Will had ridden with the knight long enough to understand that it was best not to interrupt him when he looked like that . " Tell me again what you saw , Will . All the details . Leave nothing out . ";Royce;Gared,Mallister,Frost,Waymar,;0.316666666667;51;1
" The camp is two miles farther on , over that ridge , hard beside a stream , " Will said . " I got close as I dared . There 's eight of them , men and women both . No children I could see . They put up a lean-to against the rock . The snow 's pretty well covered it now , but I could still make it out . No fire burning , but the firepit was still plain as day . No one moving . I watched a long time . No living man ever lay so still . ";Mallister;Gared,Royce,Frost,Waymar,;-0.0764880952381;56;1
" Did you see any blood ? ";Gared;Mallister,Royce,Frost,Waymar,;0.0;57;1
" Well , no , " Will admitted .;Royce;Gared,Mallister,Frost,Waymar,;0.0;58;1
" Did you see any weapons ? ";Gared;Mallister,Royce,Frost,Waymar,;0.0;59;1
" Some swords , a few bows . One man had an axe . Heavy-looking , double-bladed , a cruel piece of iron . It was on the ground beside him , right by his hand . ";Royce;Gared,Mallister,Frost,Waymar,;-0.304761904762;60;1
" Did you make note of the position of the bodies ? ";Gared;Mallister,Royce,Frost,Waymar,;0.0;61;1
Will shrugged . " A couple are sitting up against the rock . Most of them on the ground . Fallen , like . ";Waymar;Gared,Mallister,Royce,Frost,;0.5;62;1
" Or sleeping , " Royce suggested .;Royce;Gared,Mallister,Frost,Waymar,;0.0;63;1
" Fallen , " Will insisted . " There 's one woman up an ironwood , half-hid in the branches . A far-eyes . ";Gared;Mallister,Royce,Frost,Waymar,;0.0;64;1
He smiled thinly . " I took care she never saw me . When I got closer , I saw that she was n't moving neither . ";Waymar;Gared,Mallister,Royce,Frost,;0.6;65;1
" You have a chill ? ";Royce;Gared,Mallister,Frost,Waymar,;0.0;67;1
" Some , " Will muttered . " The wind , m'lord . ";Gared;Mallister,Royce,Frost,Waymar,;0.0;69;1
Frost-fallen leaves whispered past them , and Royce 's destrier moved restlessly . " What do you think might have killed these men , Gared ? ";Frost;Gared,Mallister,Royce,Waymar,;-0.25;71;1
" It was the cold , " Gared said with iron certainty . " I saw men freeze last winter , and the one before , when I was half a boy . Everyone talks about snows forty foot deep , and how the ice wind comes howling out of the north , but the real enemy is the cold . It steals up on you quieter than Will , and at first you shiver and your teeth chatter and you stamp your feet and dream of mulled wine and nice hot fires . It burns , it does . Nothing burns like the cold . But only for a while . Then it gets inside you and starts to fill you up , and after a while you do n't have the strength to fight it . It 's easier just to sit down or go to sleep . They say you do n't feel any pain toward the end . First you go weak and drowsy , and everything starts to fade , and then it 's like sinking into a sea of warm milk . Peaceful , like . ";Gared;Mallister,Royce,Frost,Waymar,;-0.0123263888889;74;1
" Such eloquence , Gared , " Ser Waymar observed . " I never suspected you had it in you . ";Waymar;Gared,Mallister,Royce,Frost,;0.0;75;1
" I 've had the cold in me too , lordling . ";Royce;Gared,Mallister,Frost,Waymar,;-0.6;76;1
Gared pulled back his hood , giving Ser Waymar a good long look at the stumps where his ears had been . " Two ears , three toes , and the little finger off my left hand . I got off light . We found my brother frozen at his watch , with a smile on his face . ";Gared;Mallister,Royce,Frost,Waymar,;0.158928571429;77;1
Ser Waymar shrugged . " You ought dress more warmly , Gared . ";Waymar;Gared,Mallister,Royce,Frost,;0.5;78;1
Gared glared at the lordling , the scars around his ear holes flushed red with anger where Maester Aemon had cut the ears away . " We 'll see how warm you can dress when the winter comes . ";Gared;Mallister,Royce,Frost,Waymar,;-0.0333333333333;79;1
" If Gared said it was the cold ... ";Royce;Gared,;-0.6;81;1
" Have you drawn any watches this past week , Will ? ";Gared;Mallister,Royce,Frost,Waymar,;-0.25;83;1
" Yes , m'lord . ";Royce;Gared,Mallister,Frost,Waymar,;0.0;84;1
" And how did you find the Wall ? ";Gared;King,;0.0;87;1
" Weeping , " Will said , frowning .;Royce;Gared,Mallister,Frost,Waymar,;0.0;88;1
He saw it clear enough , now that the lordling had pointed it out . " They could n't have froze . Not if the Wall was weeping . It was n't cold enough . ";Gared;King,;-0.125;89;1
Royce nodded . " Bright lad . We 've had a few light frosts this past week , and a quick flurry of snow now and then , but surely no cold fierce enough to kill eight grown men . Men clad in fur and leather , let me remind you , with shelter near at hand , and the means of making fire . ";Royce;Gared,Mallister,Frost,Waymar,;0.0604166666667;90;1
The knight 's smile was cocksure . " Will , lead us there . I would see these dead men for myself . ";Gared;Mallister,Royce,Frost,Waymar,;0.05;91;1
" We can make a better pace than this , surely , " Royce said when the moon was full risen .;Royce;Serrett,Gared,Waymar,;0.425;105;2
" Not with this horse , " Will said .;Gared;Royce,Serrett,Waymar,;0.0;106;2
Fear had made him insolent . " Perhaps my lord would care to take the lead ? ";Serrett;Royce,Gared,Waymar,;0.0;107;2
" Why are you stopping ? ";Gared;Royce,Serrett,Waymar,;0.0;111;2
" Best go the rest of the way on foot , m'lord . It 's just over that ridge . ";Royce;Serrett,Gared,Waymar,;1.0;113;2
" There 's something wrong here , " Gared muttered .;Gared;Royce,Serrett,Waymar,;-0.5;117;2
The young knight gave him a disdainful smile . " Is there ? ";Royce;Serrett,Gared,Waymar,;0.2;118;2
" Ca n't you feel it ? ";Waymar;Royce,Serrett,Gared,;0.0;119;2
Gared asked . " Listen to the darkness . ";Gared;Royce,Serrett,Waymar,;0.0;120;2
" Wind . Trees rustling . A wolf . Which sound is it that unmans you so , Gared ? ";Royce;Serrett,Gared,Waymar,;0.4;124;2
" The trees press close here , " Will warned . " That sword will tangle you up , m'lord . Better a knife . ";Gared;Royce,Serrett,Waymar,;0.5;130;2
" If I need instruction , I will ask for it , " the young lord said . " Gared , stay here . Guard the horses . ";Royce;Serrett,Gared,Waymar,;0.1;131;2
Gared dismounted . " We need a fire . I 'll see to it . ";Gared;Royce,Serrett,Waymar,;0.0;132;2
" How big a fool are you , old man ? If there are enemies in this wood , a fire is the last thing we want . ";Royce;Serrett,Gared,Waymar,;0.0333333333333;133;2
" There 's some enemies a fire will keep away , " Gared said . " Bears and direwolves and ... and other things ... ";Gared;Royce,Serrett,Waymar,;-0.125;134;2
Ser Waymar 's mouth became a hard line . " No fire . ";Waymar;Royce,Serrett,Gared,;-0.291666666667;135;2
Finally Gared looked down . " No fire , " he muttered , low under his breath .;Gared;Royce,Serrett,Waymar,;-0.0777777777778;139;2
Royce took it for acquiescence and turned away . " Lead on , " he said to Will .;Royce;Serrett,Gared,Waymar,;0.0;140;2
" Gods ! ";Serrett;Royce,;0.0;153;3
" Get down ! ";Serrett;Royce,;-0.194444444444;157;3
Will whispered urgently . " Something 's wrong . ";Royce;Serrett,;-0.5;158;3
He looked down at the empty clearing and laughed . " Your dead men seem to have moved camp , Will . ";Serrett;Royce,;0.0611111111111;160;3
" On your feet , Will , " Ser Waymar commanded . " There 's no one here . I wo n't have you hiding under a bush . ";Waymar;;0.0;167;4
Ser Waymar looked him over with open disapproval . " I am not going back to Castle Black a failure on my first ranging . We will find these men . ";Waymar;;0.0208333333333;169;4
He glanced around . " Up the tree . Be quick about it . Look for a fire . ";Waymar;;0.333333333333;170;4
Down below , the lordling called out suddenly , " Who goes there ? ";;;-0.155555555556;181;5
" Will , where are you ? ";Waymar;;0.0;195;6
Ser Waymar called up . " Can you see anything ? ";Waymar;;0.0;196;6
There was nothing to see . " Answer me ! Why is it so cold ? ";Waymar;;-0.6;199;6
Will heard the breath go out of Ser Waymar Royce in a long hiss . " Come no farther , " the lordling warned .;Serrett;;-0.05;209;7
Ser Waymar met him bravely . " Dance with me then . ";Waymar;;0.0;218;8
Ser Waymar Royce found his fury . " For Robert ! ";Serrett;;0.0;253;9
Lord Eddard Stark dismounted and his ward Theon Greyjoy brought forth the sword . " Ice , " that sword was called .;Lord;Ice,Snow,;-0.2;317;10
He took hold of Ice with both hands and said , " In the name of Robert of the House Baratheon , the First of his Name , King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men , Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm , by the word of Eddard of the House Stark , Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North , I do sentence you to die . ";Ice;Lord,Snow,;0.1;322;10
Bran 's bastard brother Jon Snow moved closer . " Keep the pony well in hand , " he whispered . " And do n't look away . Father will know if you do . ";Snow;Father,;0.0;324;10
" Ass , " Jon muttered , low enough so Greyjoy did not hear .;Jon;Bran,Robb,Tully,;0.0;335;11
He put a hand on Bran 's shoulder , and Bran looked over at his bastard brother . " You did well , " Jon told him solemnly .;Bran;Jon,Robb,Tully,;0.0;336;11
" The deserter died bravely , " Robb said .;Robb;Jon,Bran,Tully,;0.0;340;11
He was big and broad and growing every day , with his mother 's coloring , the fair skin , red-brown hair , and blue eyes of the Tullys of Riverrun . " He had courage , at the least . ";Tully;Jon,Bran,Robb,;0.0925;341;11
" No , " Jon Snow said quietly . " It was not courage . This one was dead of fear . You could see it in his eyes , Stark . ";Jon;Bran,Robb,Tully,;-0.2;342;11
Robb was not impressed . " The Others take his eyes , " he swore . " He died well . Race you to the bridge ? ";Robb;Jon,Bran,Tully,;1.0;346;11
" Done , " Jon said , kicking his horse forward .;Jon;Bran,Robb,Tully,;0.0;347;11
So deep in thought was he that he never heard the rest of the party until his father moved up to ride beside him . " Are you well , Bran ? ";Jory;Bran,Jon,;0.0;354;12
" Yes , Father , " Bran told him .;Bran;Jon,Jory,;0.0;356;12
Wrapped in his furs and leathers , mounted on his great warhorse , his lord father loomed over him like a giant . " Robb says the man died bravely , but Jon says he was afraid . ";Jory;Robb,Jon,;0.0666666666667;358;12
" What do you think ? ";Jon;Bran,Jory,;0.0;359;12
Bran thought about it . " Can a man still be brave if he 's afraid ? ";Bran;Jon,Jory,;0.1;361;12
" That is the only time a man can be brave , " his father told him . " Do you understand why I did it ? ";Jory;Bran,Jon,;0.4;362;12
" He was a wildling , " Bran said . " They carry off women and sell them to the Others . ";Bran;Jon,Jory,;0.0;363;12
His lord father smiled . " Old Nan has been telling you stories again . In truth , the man was an oathbreaker , a deserter from the Night 's Watch . No man is more dangerous . The deserter knows his life is forfeit if he is taken , so he will not flinch from any crime , no matter how vile . But you mistake me . The question was not why the man had to die , but why I must do it . ";Jory;Nan,;0.15;364;12
Bran had no answer for that . " King Robert has a headsman , " he said , uncertainly .;Bran;King,;0.0;365;12
" He does , " his father admitted . " As did the Targaryen kings before him . Yet our way is the older way . The blood of the First Men still flows in the veins of the Starks , and we hold to the belief that the man who passes the sentence should swing the sword . If you would take a man 's life , you owe it to him to look into his eyes and hear his final words . And if you cannot bear to do that , then perhaps the man does not deserve to die .;Jory;Bran,Jon,;0.138888888889;366;12
" One day , Bran , you will be Robb 's bannerman , holding a keep of your own for your brother and your king , and justice will fall to you . When that day comes , you must take no pleasure in the task , but neither must you look away . A ruler who hides behind paid executioners soon forgets what death is . ";Jon;Robb,;0.1;367;12
He waved and shouted down at them . " Father , Bran , come quickly , see what Robb has found ! ";Bran;Robb,;-0.194444444444;369;12
Jory rode up beside them . " Trouble , my lord ? ";Jory;Bran,Jon,;0.0;371;12
" Beyond a doubt , " his lord father said . " Come , let us see what mischief my sons have rooted out now . ";Bran;Jon,Jory,;0.0;372;12
Bran heard the breath go out of him . " Gods ! ";Bran;Jory,Robb,Greyjoy,;0.0;382;13
Jory 's sword was already out . " Robb , get away from it ! ";Jory;Bran,Robb,Greyjoy,;0.0;384;13
Robb grinned and looked up from the bundle in his arms . " She ca n't hurt you , " he said . " She 's dead , Jory . ";Robb;Bran,Jory,Greyjoy,;-0.2;386;13
By then Jon , Jory , and Theon Greyjoy had all dismounted as well . " What in the seven hells is it ? ";Greyjoy;Bran,Jory,Robb,;0.0;390;13
" A wolf , " Robb told him .;Robb;Bran,Jory,Greyjoy,;0.0;392;13
" A freak , " Greyjoy said . " Look at the size of it . ";Greyjoy;Bran,Jory,Robb,;0.0;393;13
" It 's no freak , " Jon said calmly . " That 's a direwolf . They grow larger than the other kind . ";Jon;Greyjoy,Bran,Hullen,Jory,Father,Snow,Robb,;0.158333333333;400;14
Theon Greyjoy said , " There 's not been a direwolf sighted south of the Wall in two hundred years . ";Greyjoy;Jon,Bran,Hullen,Jory,Father,Snow,Robb,;0.0;401;14
" I see one now , " Jon replied .;Jon;Greyjoy,Bran,Hullen,Jory,Father,Snow,Robb,;0.0;402;14
Bran reached out hesitantly . " Go on , " Robb told him . " You can touch him . ";Bran;Jon,Greyjoy,Hullen,Jory,Father,Snow,Robb,;0.0;408;14
Bran gave the pup a quick nervous stroke , then turned as Jon said , " Here you go . ";Bran;Jon,Greyjoy,Hullen,Jory,Father,Snow,Robb,;0.333333333333;409;14
His half brother put a second pup into his arms . " There are five of them . ";Jon;Greyjoy,Bran,Hullen,Jory,Father,Snow,Robb,;-0.0833333333333;410;14
" Direwolves loose in the realm , after so many years , " muttered Hullen , the master of horse . " I like it not . ";Hullen;Jon,Greyjoy,Bran,Jory,Father,Snow,Robb,;0.211538461538;413;14
" It is a sign , " Jory said .;Jory;Jon,Greyjoy,Bran,Hullen,Father,Snow,Robb,;0.0;414;14
Father frowned . " This is only a dead animal , Jory , " he said .;Father;Jon,Greyjoy,Bran,Hullen,Jory,Snow,Robb,;-0.1;415;14
Snow crunched under his boots as he moved around the body . " Do we know what killed her ? ";Snow;Jon,Greyjoy,Bran,Hullen,Jory,Father,Robb,;0.0;417;14
" There 's something in the throat , " Robb told him , proud to have found the answer before his father even asked . " There , just under the jaw . ";Robb;Jon,Greyjoy,Bran,Hullen,Jory,Father,Snow,;0.8;418;14
His father tossed the antler to the side and cleansed his hands in the snow . " I 'm surprised she lived long enough to whelp , " he said .;Jon;Jory,Hullen,Greyjoy,Bran,Robb,Harwin,;0.0166666666667;425;15
" Maybe she did n't , " Jory said . " I 've heard tales ... maybe the bitch was already dead when the pups came . ";Jory;Hullen,Greyjoy,Bran,Robb,Harwin,Jon,;-0.2;427;15
" Born with the dead , " another man put in . " Worse luck . ";Jon;Jory,Hullen,Greyjoy,Bran,Robb,Harwin,;-0.3;428;15
" No matter , " said Hullen . " They be dead soon enough too . ";Hullen;Jory,Greyjoy,Bran,Robb,Harwin,Jon,;-0.1;429;15
" The sooner the better , " Theon Greyjoy agreed .;Greyjoy;Jory,Hullen,Bran,Robb,Harwin,Jon,;0.5;431;15
He drew his sword . " Give the beast here , Bran . ";Jon;Jory,Hullen,Greyjoy,Bran,Robb,Harwin,;0.0;432;15
The little thing squirmed against him , as if it heard and understood . " No ! ";Robb;Jory,Hullen,Greyjoy,Bran,Harwin,Jon,;-0.234375;433;15
Bran cried out fiercely . " It 's mine . ";Bran;Jory,Hullen,Greyjoy,Robb,Harwin,Jon,;0.0;434;15
" Put away your sword , Greyjoy , " Robb said .;Robb;Jory,Hullen,Greyjoy,Bran,Harwin,Jon,;0.0;435;15
For a moment he sounded as commanding as their father , like the lord he would someday be . " We will keep these pups . ";Jon;Jory,Hullen,Greyjoy,Bran,Robb,Harwin,;0.0;436;15
" You cannot do that , boy , " said Harwin , who was Hullen 's son .;Harwin;Jory,Hullen,Greyjoy,Bran,Robb,Jon,;0.0;437;15
" It be a mercy to kill them , " Hullen said .;Hullen;Jory,Greyjoy,Bran,Robb,Harwin,Jon,;0.0;438;15
Bran looked to his lord father for rescue , but got only a frown , a furrowed brow . " Hullen speaks truly , son . Better a swift death than a hard one from cold and starvation . ";Bran;Hullen,;-0.0979166666667;439;15
" No ! ";Jon;Jory,Hullen,Greyjoy,Bran,Robb,Harwin,;0.0;440;15
Robb resisted stubbornly . " Ser Rodrik 's red bitch whelped again last week , " he said . " It was a small litter , only two live pups . She 'll have milk enough . ";Robb;Jory,Hullen,Greyjoy,Bran,Harwin,Jon,;-0.0189393939394;443;15
" She 'll rip them apart when they try to nurse . ";Bran;Jory,Hullen,Greyjoy,Robb,Harwin,Jon,;0.0;444;15
" Lord Stark , " Jon said .;Jon;Jory,Hullen,Greyjoy,Bran,Robb,Harwin,;-0.2;445;15
Bran looked at him with desperate hope . " There are five pups , " he told Father . " Three male , two female . ";Bran;Jory,Hullen,Greyjoy,Robb,Harwin,Jon,;-0.2;447;15
" What of it , Jon ? ";Robb;Jory,Hullen,Greyjoy,Bran,Harwin,Jon,;0.0;448;15
" You have five trueborn children , " Jon said . " Three sons , two daughters . The direwolf is the sigil of your House . Your children were meant to have these pups , my lord . ";Jon;Jory,Hullen,Greyjoy,Bran,Robb,Harwin,;0.0;449;15
Their father understood as well . " You want no pup for yourself , Jon ? ";Bran;Jory,Hullen,Greyjoy,Robb,Harwin,Jon,;0.0;455;15
" The direwolf graces the banners of House Stark , " Jon pointed out . " I am no Stark , Father . ";Jon;Stark,;-0.2;457;15
Robb rushed into the silence he left . " I will nurse him myself , Father , " he promised . " I will soak a towel with warm milk , and give him suck from that . ";Robb;Jory,Hullen,Greyjoy,Bran,Harwin,Jon,;0.3;459;15
" Me too ! ";Jon;Jory,Hullen,Greyjoy,Bran,Robb,Harwin,;0.0;460;15
The lord weighed his sons long and carefully with his eyes . " Easy to say , and harder to do . I will not have you wasting the servants ' time with this . If you want these pups , you will feed them yourselves . Is that understood ? ";Bran;Jory,Hullen,Greyjoy,Robb,Harwin,Jon,;0.0944444444444;462;15
" You must train them as well , " their father said . " You must train them . The kennelmaster will have nothing to do with these monsters , I promise you that . And the gods help you if you neglect them , or brutalize them , or train them badly . These are not dogs to beg for treats and slink off at a kick . A direwolf will rip a man 's arm off his shoulder as easily as a dog will kill a rat . Are you sure you want this ? ";Jon;Jory,Hullen,Greyjoy,Bran,Robb,Harwin,;0.5;465;15
" Yes , Father , " Bran said .;Bran;Jory,Hullen,Greyjoy,Robb,Harwin,Jon,;0.0;466;15
" Yes , " Robb agreed .;Robb;Jory,Hullen,Greyjoy,Bran,Harwin,Jon,;0.0;467;15
" The pups may die anyway , despite all you do . ";Jon;Jory,Hullen,Greyjoy,Bran,Robb,Harwin,;0.0;468;15
" They wo n't die , " Robb said . " We wo n't let them die . ";Robb;Jory,Hullen,Greyjoy,Bran,Harwin,Jon,;0.0;469;15
" Keep them , then . Jory , Desmond , gather up the other pups . It 's time we were back to Winterfell . ";Bran;Jory,Hullen,Greyjoy,Robb,Harwin,Jon,;-0.0625;470;15
" What is it , Jon ? ";Jon;Jory,Hullen,Greyjoy,Bran,Robb,Harwin,;0.0;475;15
" Ca n't you hear it ? ";Bran;Jory,Hullen,Greyjoy,Robb,Harwin,Jon,;0.0;477;15
" There , " Jon said .;Jon;Jory,Hullen,Greyjoy,Bran,Robb,Harwin,;0.0;479;15
" He must have crawled away from the others , " Jon said .;Jon;Jory,Hullen,Greyjoy,Bran,Robb,Harwin,;0.0;483;15
" Or been driven away , " their father said , looking at the sixth pup .;Robb;Jory,Hullen,Greyjoy,Bran,Harwin,Jon,;0.0;484;15
" An albino , " Theon Greyjoy said with wry amusement . " This one will die even faster than the others . ";Greyjoy;Jory,Hullen,Bran,Robb,Harwin,Jon,;0.0;488;15
Jon Snow gave his father 's ward a long , chilling look . " I think not , Greyjoy , " he said . " This one belongs to me . ";Jon;Jory,Hullen,Greyjoy,Bran,Robb,Harwin,;-0.275;489;15
At the center of the grove an ancient weirwood brooded over a small pool where the waters were black and cold . " The heart tree , " Ned called it .;Ned;;-0.279166666667;512;16
A thousand years of humus lay thick upon the godswood floor , swallowing the sound of her feet , but the red eyes of the weirwood seemed to follow her as she came . " Ned , " she called softly .;Ice;Ned,Catelyn,;0.0333333333333;523;17
He lifted his head to look at her . " Catelyn , " he said .;Ned;Ice,Catelyn,;0.0;524;17
His voice was distant and formal . " Where are the children ? ";Catelyn;Ice,Ned,;-0.1;525;17
He would always ask her that . " In the kitchen , arguing about names for the wolf pups . ";Ned;Ice,Catelyn,;0.0;526;17
She could feel the eyes watching her , but she did her best to ignore them . " Arya is already in love , and Sansa is charmed and gracious , but Rickon is not quite sure . ";Catelyn;Arya,Rickon,;0.666666666667;528;17
" Is he afraid ? ";Ned;Ice,Catelyn,;-0.6;529;17
" A little , " she admitted . " He is only three . ";Catelyn;Ice,Ned,;-0.09375;531;17
Ned frowned . " He must learn to face his fears . He will not be three forever . And winter is coming . ";Ned;Ice,Catelyn,;0.0;532;17
" Yes , " Catelyn agreed .;Catelyn;Ice,Ned,;0.0;533;17
" The man died well , I 'll give him that , " Ned said .;Ned;Catelyn,Ice,Dread,Rock,;0.0;541;18
He ran it lightly up the greatsword as he spoke , polishing the metal to a dark glow . " I was glad for Bran 's sake . You would have been proud of Bran . ";Dread;Ned,Catelyn,Ice,Rock,;0.383333333333;543;18
" I am always proud of Bran , " Catelyn replied , watching the sword as he stroked it .;Catelyn;Ned,Ice,Dread,Rock,;0.8;544;18
" He was the fourth this year , " Ned said grimly . " The poor man was half-mad . Something had put a fear in him so deep that my words could not reach him . ";Ned;Catelyn,Ice,Dread,Rock,;-0.133333333333;550;18
He sighed . " Ben writes that the strength of the Night 's Watch is down below a thousand . It 's not only desertions . They are losing men on rangings as well . ";Catelyn;Benjen,;-0.0777777777778;551;18
" Is it the wildlings ? ";Ned;Catelyn,Ice,Dread,Rock,;0.0;552;18
" Who else ? ";Catelyn;Ned,Ice,Dread,Rock,;0.0;554;18
Ned lifted Ice , looked down the cool steel length of it . " And it will only grow worse . The day may come when I will have no choice but to call the banners and ride north to deal with this King-beyond-the-Wall for good and all . ";Ned;Catelyn,Ice,Dread,Rock,;0.0888888888889;555;18
" Beyond the Wall ? ";Catelyn;Ned,Ice,Dread,Rock,;0.0;556;18
Ned saw the dread on her face . " Mance Rayder is nothing for us to fear . ";Ned;Mance,;0.0;558;18
" There are darker things beyond the Wall . ";Catelyn;Ned,Ice,Dread,Rock,;0.0;559;18
His smile was gentle . " You listen to too many of Old Nan 's stories . The Others are as dead as the children of the forest , gone eight thousand years . Maester Luwin will tell you they never lived at all . No living man has ever seen one . ";Ned;Maester,;0.18;561;18
" Until this morning , no living man had ever seen a direwolf either , " Catelyn reminded him .;Catelyn;Ned,Ice,Dread,Rock,;0.0;562;18
" I ought to know better than to argue with a Tully , " he said with a rueful smile .;Ned;Catelyn,Ice,Dread,Rock,;0.4;563;18
He slid Ice back into its sheath . " You did not come here to tell me crib tales . I know how little you like this place . What is it , my lady ? ";Ice;Ned,Catelyn,Dread,Rock,;-0.09375;564;18
Catelyn took her husband 's hand . " There was grievous news today , my lord . I did not wish to trouble you until you had cleansed yourself . ";Catelyn;Ned,Ice,Dread,Rock,;-0.8;565;18
There was no way to soften the blow , so she told him straight . " I am so sorry , my love . Jon Arryn is dead . ";Dread;Jon,;0.0;566;18
" Jon ... ";Ned;Catelyn,Ice,Dread,Rock,;0.0;571;18
he said . " Is this news certain ? ";Catelyn;Ned,Ice,Dread,Rock,;0.214285714286;572;18
" It was the king 's seal , and the letter is in Robert 's own hand . I saved it for you . He said Lord Arryn was taken quickly . Even Maester Pycelle was helpless , but he brought the milk of the poppy , so Jon did not linger long in pain . ";Ned;Lord,Jon,;0.275;573;18
" That is some small mercy , I suppose , " he said .;Catelyn;Ned,Ice,Dread,Rock,;-0.25;574;18
She could see the grief on his face , but even then he thought first of her . " Your sister , " he said . " And Jon 's boy . What word of them ? ";Ned;Catelyn,Ice,Dread,Rock,;-0.275;575;18
" The message said only that they were well , and had returned to the Eyrie , " Catelyn said . " I wish they had gone to Riverrun instead . The Eyrie is high and lonely , and it was ever her husband 's place , not hers . Lord Jon 's memory will haunt each stone . I know my sister . She needs the comfort of family and friends around her . ";Catelyn;Eyrie,;0.02;576;18
" Your uncle waits in the Vale , does he not ? Jon named him Knight of the Gate , I'd heard . ";Ned;Jon,Knight,;0.0;577;18
Catelyn nodded . " Brynden will do what he can for her , and for the boy . That is some comfort , but still ... ";Catelyn;Brynden,;0.0;578;18
" Go to her , " Ned urged . " Take the children . Fill her halls with noise and shouts and laughter . That boy of hers needs other children about him , and Lysa should not be alone in her grief . ";Ned;Lysa,;-0.4625;579;18
" Would that I could , " Catelyn said . " The letter had other tidings . The king is riding to Winterfell to seek you out . ";Catelyn;Ned,Ice,Dread,Rock,;-0.125;580;18
It took Ned a moment to comprehend her words , but when the understanding came , the darkness left his eyes . " Robert is coming here ? ";Ned;Robert,;0.0;581;18
Dread coiled within her like a snake , but she forced herself to smile at this man she loved , this man who put no faith in signs . " I knew that would please you , " she said . " We should send word to your brother on the Wall . ";Dread;Ned,Catelyn,Ice,Rock,;0.233333333333;585;18
" Yes , of course , " he agreed . " Ben will want to be here . I shall tell Maester Luwin to send his swiftest bird . ";Catelyn;Benjen,Maester,;0.0;586;18
Ned rose and pulled her to her feet . " Damnation , how many years has it been ? And he gives us no more notice than this ? How many in his party , did the message say ? ";Ned;Catelyn,Ice,Dread,Rock,;0.525;587;18
" I should think a hundred knights , at the least , with all their retainers , and half again as many freeriders . Cersei and the children travel with them . ";Catelyn;Ned,Ice,Dread,Rock,;0.0111111111111;588;18
" Robert will keep an easy pace for their sakes , " he said . " It is just as well . That will give us more time to prepare . ";Ned;Robert,;0.466666666667;589;18
" The queen 's brothers are also in the party , " she told him .;Catelyn;Ned,Ice,Dread,Rock,;0.0;590;18
The Lannisters of Casterly Rock had come late to Robert 's cause , when victory was all but certain , and he had never forgiven them . " Well , if the price for Robert 's company is an infestation of Lannisters , so be it . It sounds as though Robert is bringing half his court . ";Rock;Robert,;-0.084126984127;593;18
" Where the king goes , the realm follows , " she said .;Ned;Catelyn,Ice,Dread,Rock,;0.0;594;18
" It will be good to see the children . The youngest was still sucking at the Lannister woman 's teat the last time I saw him . He must be , what , five by now ? ";Catelyn;Ned,Ice,Dread,Rock,;0.325;595;18
" Prince Tommen is seven , " she told him . " The same age as Bran . Please , Ned , guard your tongue . The Lannister woman is our queen , and her pride is said to grow with every passing year . ";Dread;Tom,;0.0;596;18
Ned squeezed her hand . " There must be a feast , of course , with singers , and Robert will want to hunt . I shall send Jory south with an honor guard to meet them on the kingsroad and escort them back . Gods , how are we going to feed them all ? On his way already , you said ? Damn the man . Damn his royal hide . ";Ned;Robert,Jory,;0.0;597;18
" This is beauty . Touch it . Go on . Caress the fabric . ";Dany;Viserys,;0.0;602;19
She pulled her hand away . " Is it really mine ? ";Dany;Viserys,;0.0;607;19
" A gift from the Magister Illyrio , " Viserys said , smiling .;Viserys;Dany,;0.0;608;19
Her brother was in a high mood tonight . " The color will bring out the violet in your eyes . And you shall have gold as well , and jewels of all sorts . Illyrio has promised . Tonight you must look like a princess . ";Dany;Illyrio,;0.16;609;19
Perhaps she had never really known . " Why does he give us so much ? ";Dany;Viserys,;0.05;612;19
she asked . " What does he want from us ? ";Dany;Viserys,;0.0;613;19
" Illyrio is no fool , " Viserys said .;Viserys;Illyrio,;0.0;616;19
He was a gaunt young man with nervous hands and a feverish look in his pale lilac eyes . " The magister knows that I will not forget my friends when I come into my throne . ";Dany;Viserys,;0.0;617;19
Viserys called it " waking the dragon . ";Viserys;Dany,;0.0;624;20
Her brother hung the gown beside the door . " Illyrio will send the slaves to bathe you . Be sure you wash off the stink of the stables . Khal Drogo has a thousand horses , tonight he looks for a different sort of mount . ";Viserys;Illyrio,Drogo,;0.25;625;20
He studied her critically . " You still slouch . Straighten yourself . ";Viserys;Dany,;0.0;626;20
He pushed back her shoulders with his hands . " Let them see that you have a woman 's shape now . ";Viserys;Dany,;0.0;627;20
His fingers brushed lightly over her budding breasts and tightened on a nipple . " You will not fail me tonight . If you do , it will go hard for you . You do n't want to wake the dragon , do you ? ";Viserys;Dany,;-0.172916666667;628;20
His fingers twisted her , the pinch cruelly hard through the rough fabric of her tunic . " Do you ? ";Viserys;Dany,;-0.297222222222;629;20
" No , " Dany said meekly .;Dany;Viserys,;0.0;631;20
Her brother smiled . " Good . ";Viserys;Dany,;0.625;632;20
He touched her hair , almost with affection . " When they write the history of my reign , sweet sister , they will say that it began tonight . ";Dany;Viserys,;0.35;633;20
Her brother had a simpler name . " Our land , " he called it .;Cities;;0.0;641;21
If he said them enough , the gods were sure to hear . " Ours by blood right , taken from us by treachery , but ours still , ours forever . You do not steal from the dragon , oh , no . The dragon remembers . ";Cities;;0.261904761905;643;21
He called her " Little Princess " and sometimes " My Lady , " and his hands were soft as old leather .;Dany;;0.00416666666667;665;22
In the alleys and wine sinks of Pentos , they called her brother " the beggar king . ";Pentos;Dany,;0.0;676;23
" We will have it all back someday , sweet sister , " he would promise her .;Pentos;Dany,;0.175;678;23
Sometimes his hands shook when he talked about it . " The jewels and the silks , Dragonstone and King 's Landing , the Iron Throne and the Seven Kingdoms , all they have taken from us , we will have it back . ";Pentos;Dany,;0.0;679;23
There came a soft knock on her door . " Come , " Dany said , turning away from the window .;Dany;Pentos,;0.1;682;23
Besides , her brother had often told her that it was never too hot for a Targaryen . " Ours is the house of the dragon , " he would say . " The fire is in our blood . ";Targaryen;;0.25;694;24
The girl scrubbed her back and her feet and told her how lucky she was . " Drogo is so rich that even his slaves wear golden collars . A hundred thousand men ride in his khalasar , and his palace in Vaes Dothrak has two hundred rooms and doors of solid silver . ";Targaryen;Drogo,Dothraki,;0.201666666667;696;24
" Now you look all a princess , " the girl said breathlessly when they were done .;Illyrio;Gemstones,Viserys,;0.0;709;25
He rose when she appeared and looked her over critically . " Stand there , " he told her . " Turn around . Yes . Good . You look ... ";Viserys;Illyrio,Gemstones,;0.625;714;25
" Regal , " Magister Illyrio said , stepping through an archway .;Illyrio;Gemstones,Viserys,;0.0;715;25
Gemstones glittered on every finger , and his man had oiled his forked yellow beard until it shone like real gold . " May the Lord of Light shower you with blessings on this most fortunate day , Princess Daenerys , " the magister said as he took her hand .;Gemstones;Illyrio,Viserys,;0.28;718;25
He bowed his head , showing a thin glimpse of crooked yellow teeth through the gold of his beard . " She is a vision , Your Grace , a vision , " he told her brother . " Drogo will be enraptured . ";Illyrio;Drogo,;-0.133333333333;719;25
" She 's too skinny , " Viserys said .;Viserys;Illyrio,Gemstones,;0.0;720;25
He rested his hand on the hilt of the sword that Illyrio had lent him , and said , " Are you sure that Khal Drogo likes his women this young ? ";Illyrio;Drogo,;0.3;723;25
" She has had her blood . She is old enough for the khal , " Illyrio told him , not for the first time . " Look at her . That silver-gold hair , those purple eyes ... she is the blood of old Valyria , no doubt , no doubt ... and highborn , daughter of the old king , sister to the new , she cannot fail to entrance our Drogo . ";Illyrio;Drogo,;0.0266233766234;724;25
" I suppose , " her brother said doubtfully . " The savages have queer tastes . Boys , horses , sheep ... ";Viserys;Illyrio,Gemstones,;0.0;726;25
" Best not suggest this to Khal Drogo , " Illyrio said .;Illyrio;Gemstones,Viserys,;1.0;727;25
Anger flashed in her brother 's lilac eyes . " Do you take me for a fool ? ";Viserys;Illyrio,Gemstones,;-0.7;728;25
The magister bowed slightly . " I take you for a king . Kings lack the caution of common men . My apologies if I have given offense . ";Illyrio;King,;-0.3;729;25
His mind was away across the narrow sea . " We wo n't need his whole khalasar , " Viserys said .;Viserys;Dany,anxiously,Illyrio,Cities,;0.0;736;26
His fingers toyed with the hilt of his borrowed blade , though Dany knew he had never used a sword in earnest . " Ten thousand , that would be enough , I could sweep the Seven Kingdoms with ten thousand Dothraki screamers . The realm will rise for its rightful king . Tyrell , Redwyne , Darry , Greyjoy , they have no more love for the Usurper than I do . The Dornishmen burn to avenge Elia and her children . And the smallfolk will be with us . They cry out for their king . ";Dany;Viserys,anxiously,Illyrio,Cities,;0.2;737;26
He looked at Illyrio anxiously . " They do , do n't they ? ";anxiously;Viserys,Dany,Illyrio,Cities,;0.0;738;26
" They are your people , and they love you well , " Magister Illyrio said amiably . " In holdfasts all across the realm , men lift secret toasts to your health while women sew dragon banners and hide them against the day of your return from across the water . ";Illyrio;Viserys,Dany,anxiously,Cities,;0.05;739;26
He gave a massive shrug . " Or so my agents tell me . ";Viserys;Dany,anxiously,Illyrio,Cities,;0.0;740;26
Her brother was nodding eagerly , however . " I shall kill the Usurper myself , " he promised , who had never killed anyone , " as he killed my brother Rhaegar . And Lannister too , the Kingslayer , for what he did to my father . ";Cities;Rhaegar,;0.0;742;26
" That would be most fitting , " Magister Illyrio said .;Illyrio;Viserys,Dany,anxiously,Cities,;0.5;743;26
The Free Cities were always generous with the horselords . " It is not that we fear these barbarians , " Illyrio would explain with a smile . " The Lord of Light would hold our city walls against a million Dothraki , or so the red priests promise ... yet why take chances , when their friendship comes so cheap ? ";Cities;Light,;0.3;748;26
He looked almost as frightened as she felt . " Insolent eunuch , " Viserys muttered as the palanquin lurched up toward the manse .;Viserys;Dany,anxiously,Illyrio,Cities,;0.0;754;26
Magister Illyrio 's words were honey . " Many important men will be at the feast tonight . Such men have enemies . The khal must protect his guests , yourself chief among them , Your Grace . No doubt the Usurper would pay well for your head . ";Illyrio;khal,Usurper,;0.3;755;26
" Oh , yes , " Viserys said darkly . " He has tried , Illyrio , I promise you that . His hired knives follow us everywhere . I am the last dragon , and he will not sleep easy while I live . ";Viserys;Dany,anxiously,Illyrio,Cities,;0.189898989899;756;26
Beneath an arch of twining stone leaves , a eunuch sang their coming . " Viserys of the House Targaryen , the Third of his Name , " he called in a high , sweet voice , " King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men , Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm . His sister , Daenerys Stormborn , Princess of Dragonstone . His honorable host , Illyrio Mopatis , Magister of the Free City of Pentos . ";Oil;;0.232;765;27
Illyrio whispered to them . " Those three are Drogo 's bloodriders , there , " he said . " By the pillar is Khal Moro , with his son Rhogoro . The man with the green beard is brother to the Archon of Tyrosh , and the man behind him is Ser Jorah Mormont . ";Illyrio;Drogo,Moro,;-0.3;772;28
The last name caught Daenerys . " A knight ? ";Daenerys;Illyrio,;0.0;773;28
" No less . ";Illyrio;Daenerys,;-0.166666666667;774;28
Illyrio smiled through his beard . " Anointed with the seven oils by the High Septon himself . ";Illyrio;Daenerys,;0.38;775;28
" What is he doing here ? ";Illyrio;Daenerys,;0.0;776;28
" The Usurper wanted his head , " Illyrio told them . " Some trifling affront . He sold some poachers to a Tyroshi slaver instead of giving them to the Night 's Watch . Absurd law . A man should be able to do as he likes with his own chattel . ";Illyrio;Usurper,;0.2;778;28
" I shall wish to speak with Ser Jorah before the night is done , " her brother said .;Illyrio;Daenerys,;0.0;779;28
She was still looking at this strange man from the homeland she had never known when Magister Illyrio placed a moist hand on her bare shoulder . " Over there , sweet princess , " he whispered , " there is the khal himself . ";Illyrio;Daenerys,;0.116666666667;784;28
" I must go and make my submissions , " Magister Illyrio said . " Wait here . I shall bring him to you . ";Illyrio;Viserys,meaning,;0.0;791;29
Her brother took her by the arm as Illyrio waddled over to the khal , his fingers squeezing so hard that they hurt . " Do you see his braid , sweet sister ? ";Illyrio;Viserys,meaning,;0.0291666666667;792;29
" You see how long it is ? ";meaning;Illyrio,Viserys,;-0.05;795;29
Viserys said . " When Dothraki are defeated in combat , they cut off their braids in disgrace , so the world will know their shame . Khal Drogo has never lost a fight . He is Aegon the Dragonlord come again , and you will be his queen . ";Viserys;Dothraki,Drogo,;0.0;796;29
Her brother hurt her sometimes , when she woke the dragon , but he did not frighten her the way this man frightened her . " I do n't want to be his queen , " she heard herself say in a small , thin voice . " Please , please , Viserys , I do n't want to , I want to go home . ";Illyrio;Viserys,meaning,;-0.325;799;29
" Home ! ";Viserys;Illyrio,meaning,;0.0;800;29
He kept his voice low , but she could hear the fury in his tone . " How are we to go home , sweet sister ? They took our home from us ! ";Illyrio;Viserys,meaning,;0.21875;801;29
He drew her into the shadows , out of sight , his fingers digging into her skin . " How are we to go home ? ";meaning;Illyrio,Viserys,;0.0;802;29
His fingers dug hard into her arm , demanding an answer . " I do n't know ... ";Viserys;Illyrio,meaning,;-0.291666666667;807;29
" I do , " he said sharply . " We go home with an army , sweet sister . With Khal Drogo 's army , that is how we go home . And if you must wed him and bed him for that , you will . ";Illyrio;Viserys,meaning,;0.35;810;29
He smiled at her . " I'd let his whole khalasar fuck you if need be , sweet sister , all forty thousand men , and their horses too if that was what it took to get my army . Be grateful it is only Drogo . In time you may even learn to like him . Now dry your eyes . Illyrio is bringing him over , and he will not see you crying . ";meaning;I'd,Illyrio,;0.0690476190476;811;29
" Smile , " Viserys whispered nervously , his hand falling to the hilt of his sword . " And stand up straight . Let him see that you have breasts . Gods know , you have little enough as is . ";Viserys;Gods,;0.078125;815;29
until he vaulted off the back of his warhorse with a familiar roar , and crushed him in a bone-crunching hug . " Ned ! Ah , but it is good to see that frozen face of yours . ";King;;0.2484375;826;30
The king looked him over top to bottom , and laughed . " You have not changed at all . ";King;;0.6;827;30
Yet Robert was Ned 's king now , and not just a friend , so he said only , " Your Grace . Winterfell is yours . ";Robert;Winterfell,;0.0;837;31
No sooner had those formalities of greeting been completed than the king had said to his host , " Take me down to your crypt , Eddard . I would pay my respects . ";Robert;;-0.155555555556;843;31
Ned went first with the lantern . " I was starting to think we would never reach Winterfell , " Robert complained as they descended . " In the south , the way they talk about my Seven Kingdoms , a man forgets that your part is as big as the other six combined . ";Ned;Winterfell,;-0.035;853;32
" I trust you enjoyed the journey , Your Grace ? ";earth;Ned,Robert,;0.5;854;32
Robert snorted . " Bogs and forests and fields , and scarcely a decent inn north of the Neck . I 've never seen such a vast emptiness . Where are all your people ? ";Robert;Ned,earth,;0.0555555555556;855;32
" Likely they were too shy to come out , " Ned jested .;Ned;Robert,earth,;-0.25;856;32
He could feel the chill coming up the stairs , a cold breath from deep within the earth . " Kings are a rare sight in the north . ";earth;King,;-0.1;857;32
Robert snorted . " More likely they were hiding under the snow . Snow , Ned ! ";Robert;Ned,earth,;0.3125;858;32
" Late summer snows are common enough , " Ned said . " I hope they did not trouble you . They are usually mild . ";Ned;Robert,earth,;-0.0666666666667;860;32
" The Others take your mild snows , " Robert swore . " What will this place be like in winter ? I shudder to think . ";Robert;Ned,earth,;0.333333333333;861;32
" The winters are hard , " Ned admitted . " But the Starks will endure . We always have . ";Ned;Stark,;-0.291666666667;862;32
" You need to come south , " Robert told him . " You need a taste of summer before it flees . In Highgarden there are fields of golden roses that stretch away as far as the eye can see . The fruits are so ripe they explode in your mouth-melons , peaches , fireplums , you 've never tasted such sweetness . You 'll see , I brought you some . Even at Storm 's End , with that good wind off the bay , the days are so hot you can barely move . And you ought to see the towns , Ned ! Flowers everywhere , the markets bursting with food , the summerwines so cheap and so good that you can get drunk just breathing the air . Everyone is fat and drunk and rich . ";Robert;Ned,earth,;0.195;863;32
He laughed and slapped his own ample stomach a thump . " And the girls , Ned ! ";Ned;Robert,earth,;0.8125;864;32
he exclaimed , his eyes sparkling . " I swear , women lose all modesty in the heat . They swim naked in the river , right beneath the castle . Even in the streets , it 's too damn hot for wool or fur , so they go around in these short gowns , silk if they have the silver and cotton if not , but it 's all the same when they start sweating and the cloth sticks to their skin , they might as well be naked . ";Robert;Ned,earth,;0.0892857142857;865;32
" Your Grace , " Ned said respectfully .;Ned;Robert,earth,;0.0;871;32
Between the pillars , the dead sat on their stone thrones against the walls , backs against the sepulchres that contained their mortal remains . " She is down at the end , with Father and Brandon . ";Robert;Ned,earth,;-0.177777777778;875;32
Ned did not like to think on that . " Here , " he told his king .;Ned;;0.0;891;33
" She was more beautiful than that , " the king said after a silence .;Lyanna;Ned,;0.675;905;34
Finally he rose , made awkward by his weight . " Ah , damn it , Ned , did you have to bury her in a place like this ? ";Lyanna;Ned,;0.0;907;34
His voice was hoarse with remembered grief . " She deserved more than darkness ... ";Lyanna;Ned,;-0.15;908;34
" She was a Stark of Winterfell , " Ned said quietly . " This is her place . ";Ned;Stark,;-0.2;909;34
" She should be on a hill somewhere , under a fruit tree , with the sun and clouds above her and the rain to wash her clean . ";Lyanna;Ned,;0.183333333333;910;34
" I was with her when she died , " Ned reminded the king . " She wanted to come home , to rest beside Brandon and Father . ";Ned;Lyanna,;0.0;911;34
Ned could recall none of it . " I bring her flowers when I can , " he said . " Lyanna was ... fond of flowers . ";Ned;Lyanna,;0.0;920;35
The king touched her cheek , his fingers brushing across the rough stone as gently as if it were living flesh . " I vowed to kill Rhaegar for what he did to her . ";Robert;Rhaegar,;-0.1;921;35
" You did , " Ned reminded him .;Ned;Robert,long-dead,;0.0;922;35
" Only once , " Robert said bitterly .;Robert;Ned,long-dead,;0.0;923;35
" In my dreams , I kill him every night , " Robert admitted . " A thousand deaths will still be less than he deserves . ";Robert;Ned,long-dead,;-0.166666666667;928;35
After a quiet , he said , " We should return , Your Grace . Your wife will be waiting . ";Ned;Robert,long-dead,;0.0;930;35
" The Others take my wife , " Robert muttered sourly , but he started back the way they had come , his footsteps falling heavily . " And if I hear ' Your Grace ' once more , I 'll have your head on a spike . We are more to each other than that . ";Robert;Ned,long-dead,;0.21875;931;35
" I had not forgotten , " Ned replied quietly .;Ned;Robert,long-dead,;0.0;932;35
When the king did not answer , he said , " Tell me about Jon . ";long-dead;Jon,;0.0;933;35
Robert shook his head . " I have never seen a man sicken so quickly . We gave a tourney on my son 's name day . If you had seen Jon then , you would have sworn he would live forever . A fortnight later he was dead . The sickness was like a fire in his gut . It burned right through him . ";Robert;Jon,;0.0555194805195;934;35
He paused beside a pillar , before the tomb of a long-dead Stark . " I loved that old man . ";long-dead;Ned,Robert,;0.2;935;35
" We both did . ";Robert;Ned,long-dead,;0.0;936;35
Ned paused a moment . " Catelyn fears for her sister . How does Lysa bear her grief ? ";Ned;Lysa,;-0.8;937;35
Robert 's mouth gave a bitter twist . " Not well , in truth , " he admitted . " I think losing Jon has driven the woman mad , Ned . She has taken the boy back to the Eyrie . Against my wishes . I had hoped to foster him with Tywin Lannister at Casterly Rock . Jon had no brothers , no other sons . Was I supposed to leave him to be raised by women ? ";Robert;Jon,;-0.2125;938;35
Some old wounds never truly heal , and bleed again at the slightest word . " The wife has lost the husband , " he said carefully . " Perhaps the mother feared to lose the son . The boy is very young . ";Ned;Robert,long-dead,;0.115;940;35
" Six , and sickly , and Lord of the Eyrie , gods have mercy , " the king swore . " Lord Tywin had never taken a ward before . Lysa ought to have been honored . The Lannisters are a great and noble House . She refused to even hear of it . Then she left in the dead of night , without so much as a by-your-leave . Cersei was furious . ";Robert;Lord,Lannister,Cersei,;0.26;941;35
He sighed deeply . " The boy is my namesake , did you know that ? Robert Arryn . I am sworn to protect him . How can I do that if his mother steals him away ? ";long-dead;Ned,Robert,;0.0;942;35
" I will take him as ward , if you wish , " Ned said . " Lysa should consent to that . She and Catelyn were close as girls , and she would be welcome here as well . ";Ned;Lysa,;0.8;943;35
" A generous offer , my friend , " the king said , " but too late . Lord Tywin has already given his consent . Fostering the boy elsewhere would be a grievous affront to him . ";Robert;Lord,;-0.55;944;35
" I have more concern for my nephew 's welfare than I do for Lannister pride , " Ned declared .;Ned;Robert,long-dead,;0.5;945;35
" That is because you do not sleep with a Lannister . ";Robert;Ned,long-dead,;0.0;946;35
His smile was a flash of white teeth in the thicket of the huge black beard . " Ah , Ned , " he said , " you are still too serious . ";long-dead;Ned,Robert,;0.04;948;35
He put a massive arm around Ned 's shoulders . " I had planned to wait a few days to speak to you , but I see now there 's no need for it . Come , walk with me . ";Ned;Robert,long-dead,;-0.1;949;35
The king kept his arm around Ned 's shoulder . " You must have wondered why I finally came north to Winterfell , after so long . ";Ned;Robert,long-dead,;-0.05;952;35
Ned had his suspicions , but he did not give them voice . " For the joy of my company , surely , " he said lightly . " And there is the Wall . You need to see it , Your Grace , to walk along its battlements and talk to those who man it . The Night 's Watch is a shadow of what it once was . Benjen says - ";Ned;Benjen,;0.8;953;35
" No doubt I will hear what your brother says soon enough , " Robert said . " The Wall has stood for what , eight thousand years ? It can keep a few days more . I have more pressing concerns . These are difficult times . I need good men about me . Men like Jon Arryn . He served as Lord of the Eyrie , as Warden of the East , as the Hand of the King . He will not be easy to replace . ";Robert;King,;0.197619047619;954;35
" His son ... ";Ned;Robert,long-dead,;0.0;955;35
" His son will succeed to the Eyrie and all its incomes , " Robert said brusquely . " No more . ";Robert;Ned,long-dead,;0.5;957;35
The words came unbidden . " The Arryns have always been Wardens of the East . The title goes with the domain . ";Ned;Arryn,;0.0;960;35
" Perhaps when he comes of age , the honor can be restored to him , " Robert said . " I have this year to think of , and next . A six-year-old boy is no war leader , Ned . ";Robert;Ned,long-dead,;0.0;961;35
" In peace , the title is only an honor . Let the boy keep it . For his father 's sake if not his own . Surely you owe Jon that much for his service . ";long-dead;Jon,;0.233333333333;962;35
He took his arm from around Ned 's shoulders . " Jon 's service was the duty he owed his liege lord . I am not ungrateful , Ned . You of all men ought to know that . But the son is not the father . A mere boy cannot hold the east . ";Ned;Robert,long-dead,;-0.5;964;35
Then his tone softened . " Enough of this . There is a more important office to discuss , and I would not argue with you . ";long-dead;Ned,Robert,;0.3;965;35
Robert grasped Ned by the elbow . " I have need of you , Ned . ";Robert;Ned,long-dead,;0.0;966;35
" I am yours to command , Your Grace . Always . ";Ned;Robert,long-dead,;0.0;967;35
Robert scarcely seemed to hear him . " Those years we spent in the Eyrie ... gods , those were good years . I want you at my side again , Ned . I want you down in King 's Landing , not up here at the end of the world where you are no damned use to anybody . ";Robert;Ned,long-dead,;0.247222222222;969;35
Robert looked off into the darkness , for a moment as melancholy as a Stark . " I swear to you , sitting a throne is a thousand times harder than winning one . Laws are a tedious business and counting coppers is worse . And the people ... there is no end of them . I sit on that damnable iron chair and listen to them complain until my mind is numb and my ass is raw . They all want something , money or land or justice . The lies they tell ... and my lords and ladies are no better . I am surrounded by flatterers and fools . It can drive a man to madness , Ned . Half of them do n't dare tell me the truth , and the other half ca n't find it . There are nights I wish we had lost at the Trident . Ah , no , not truly , but ... ";Robert;Ned,long-dead,;-0.135372960373;970;35
" I understand , " Ned said softly .;Ned;Robert,long-dead,;0.0;971;35
Robert looked at him . " I think you do . If so , you are the only one , my old friend . ";Robert;Ned,long-dead,;0.05;972;35
He smiled . " Lord Eddard Stark , I would name you the Hand of the King . ";Ned;Robert,long-dead,;0.2;973;35
" Your Grace , " he said . " I am not worthy of the honor . ";Robert;Ned,;0.333333333333;981;36
Robert groaned with good-humored impatience . " If I wanted to honor you , I'd let you retire . I am planning to make you run the kingdom and fight the wars while I eat and drink and wench myself into an early grave . ";Robert;I'd,;0.1;982;36
He slapped his gut and grinned . " You know the saying , about the king and his Hand ? ";Robert;Ned,;0.0;983;36
Ned knew the saying . " What the king dreams , " he said , " the Hand builds . ";Ned;Robert,;0.0;984;36
" I bedded a fishmaid once who told me the lowborn have a choicer way to put it . The king eats , they say , and the Hand takes the shit . ";Robert;Ned,;-0.2;985;36
Ned was still on one knee , his eyes upraised . " Damn it , Ned , " the king complained . " You might at least humor me with a smile . ";Ned;Robert,;-0.1;989;36
" They say it grows so cold up here in winter that a man 's laughter freezes in his throat and chokes him to death , " Ned said evenly . " Perhaps that is why the Starks have so little humor . ";Ned;Stark,;-0.39375;990;36
" Come south with me , and I 'll teach you how to laugh again , " the king promised . " You helped me win this damnable throne , now help me hold it . We were meant to rule together . If Lyanna had lived , we should have been brothers , bound by blood as well as affection . Well , it is not too late . I have a son . You have a daughter . My Joff and your Sansa shall join our houses , as Lyanna and I might once have done . ";Robert;Lyanna,Joffrey,;0.266666666667;991;36
This offer did surprise him . " Sansa is only eleven . ";Robert;Sansa,;0.0;992;36
Robert waved an impatient hand . " Old enough for betrothal . The marriage can wait a few years . ";Robert;Ned,;-0.075;993;36
The king smiled . " Now stand up and say yes , curse you . ";Robert;Ned,;0.6;994;36
" Nothing would give me greater pleasure , Your Grace , " Ned answered .;Ned;Robert,;0.5;995;36
He hesitated . " These honors are all so unexpected . May I have some time to consider ? I need to tell my wife ... ";Robert;Ned,;0.1;996;36
" Yes , yes , of course , tell Catelyn , sleep on it if you must . ";Robert;Catelyn,;0.0;997;36
The king reached down , clasped Ned by the hand , and pulled him roughly to his feet . " Just do n't keep me waiting too long . I am not the most patient of men . ";Ned;Robert,;0.0981481481481;998;36
They called him the Lion of Lannister to his face and whispered " Kingslayer " behind his back .;Lion;;-0.2;1056;37
Jon saw red eyes staring up at him . " Hungry again ? ";Jon;;0.0;1072;38
" Is this one of the direwolves I 've heard so much of ? ";Stark;Jon,;0.1;1098;39
Jon looked up happily as his uncle Ben put a hand on his head and ruffled his hair much as Jon had ruffled the wolf ' s. " Yes , " he said . " His name is Ghost . ";Jon;Stark,;0.1;1100;39
Benjen Stark straddled the bench with long legs and took the wine cup out of Jon 's hand . " Summerwine , " he said after a taste . " Nothing so sweet . How many cups have you had , Jon ? ";Stark;Jon,;0.15;1102;39
Ben Stark laughed . " As I feared . Ah , well . I believe I was younger than you the first time I got truly and sincerely drunk . ";Stark;Jon,;0.05;1104;39
Benjen watched Ghost with amusement as he ate his onion . " A very quiet wolf , " he observed .;Benjen;Jon,Stark,;0.0;1111;40
" He 's not like the others , " Jon said . " He never makes a sound . That 's why I named him Ghost . That , and because he 's white . The others are all dark , grey or black . ";Jon;Benjen,Stark,;0.00666666666667;1112;40
" There are still direwolves beyond the Wall . We hear them on our rangings . ";Benjen;Jon,Stark,;0.0;1113;40
Benjen Stark gave Jon a long look . " Do n't you usually eat at table with your brothers ? ";Stark;Benjen,Jon,;-0.125;1114;40
" Most times , " Jon answered in a flat voice . " But tonight Lady Stark thought it might give insult to the royal family to seat a bastard among them . ";Jon;Stark,;0.0916666666667;1115;40
" I see . ";Benjen;Jon,Stark,;0.0;1116;40
His uncle glanced over his shoulder at the raised table at the far end of the hall . " My brother does not seem very festive tonight . ";Jon;Benjen,Stark,;0.15;1117;40
He made many a toast , laughed loudly at every jest , and attacked each dish like a starving man , but beside him the queen seemed as cold as an ice sculpture . " The queen is angry too , " Jon told his uncle in a low , quiet voice . " Father took the king down to the crypts this afternoon . The queen did n't want him to go . ";Jon;Father,;-0.00793650793651;1124;41
Benjen gave Jon a careful , measuring look . " You do n't miss much , do you , Jon ? We could use a man like you on the Wall . ";Benjen;King,;0.0;1125;41
Jon swelled with pride . " Robb is a stronger lance than I am , but I 'm the better sword , and Hullen says I sit a horse as well as anyone in the castle . ";Jon;Robb,Hullen,;0.5;1126;41
" Notable achievements . ";Benjen;Jon,Stark,;0.5;1127;41
" Take me with you when you go back to the Wall , " Jon said in a sudden rush . " Father will give me leave to go if you ask him , I know he will . ";Jon;Father,;0.0;1128;41
Uncle Benjen studied his face carefully . " The Wall is a hard place for a boy , Jon . ";Benjen;King,;-0.291666666667;1129;41
" I am almost a man grown , " Jon protested . " I will turn fifteen on my next name day , and Maester Luwin says bastards grow up faster than other children . ";Jon;Maester,;-0.0625;1130;41
" That 's true enough , " Benjen said with a downward twist of his mouth .;Benjen;Jon,Stark,;0.175;1131;41
" Daeren Targaryen was only fourteen when he conquered Dorne , " Jon said .;Jon;Targaryen,Dorne,;0.0;1133;41
" A conquest that lasted a summer , " his uncle pointed out . " Your Boy King lost ten thousand men taking the place , and another fifty trying to hold it . Someone should have told him that war is n't a game . ";Benjen;Boy,;-0.2;1135;41
He took another sip of wine . " Also , " he said , wiping his mouth , " Daeren Targaryen was only eighteen when he died . Or have you forgotten that part ? ";Stark;Targaryen,;0.0;1136;41
" I forget nothing , " Jon boasted .;Jon;Benjen,Stark,;0.0;1137;41
He tried to sit very straight , to make himself seem taller . " I want to serve in the Night 's Watch , Uncle . ";Benjen;Jon,Stark,;0.26;1139;41
" You do n't know what you 're asking , Jon . The Night 's Watch is a sworn brotherhood . We have no families . None of us will ever father sons . Our wife is duty . Our mistress is honor . ";Stark;Jon,Benjen,;0.0;1145;41
" A bastard can have honor too , " Jon said . " I am ready to swear your oath . ";Jon;Benjen,Stark,;0.2;1146;41
" You are a boy of fourteen , " Benjen said . " Not a man , not yet . Until you have known a woman , you cannot understand what you would be giving up . ";Benjen;Jon,Stark,;0.0;1147;41
" I do n't care about that ! ";Jon;Benjen,Stark,;0.0;1148;41
" You might , if you knew what it meant , " Benjen said . " If you knew what the oath would cost you , you might be less eager to pay the price , son . ";Benjen;Jon,Stark,;-0.166666666667;1150;41
Jon felt anger rise inside him . " I 'm not your son ! ";Jon;Benjen,Stark,;-0.875;1151;41
Benjen Stark stood up . " More 's the pity . ";Stark;Jon,Benjen,;0.15;1152;41
He put a hand on Jon 's shoulder . " Come back to me after you 've fathered a few bastards of your own , and we 'll see how you feel . ";Jon;Benjen,Stark,;0.133333333333;1153;41
Jon trembled . " I will never father a bastard , " he said carefully . " Never ! ";Jon;Benjen,Stark,;0.0;1154;41
" I must be excused , " he said with the last of his dignity .;Benjen;Jon,Stark,;0.0;1159;41
" Boy , " a voice called out to him .;Jon;Lannister,;0.0;1176;42
The dwarf grinned down at him . " Is that animal a wolf ? ";Jon;Lannister,;-0.155555555556;1179;42
" A direwolf , " Jon said . " His name is Ghost . ";Jon;Lannister,;0.0;1180;42
He stared up at the little man , his disappointment suddenly forgotten . " What are you doing up there ? Why are n't you at the feast ? ";Jon;Lannister,;-0.39375;1181;42
" Too hot , too noisy , and I'd drunk too much wine , " the dwarf told him . " I learned long ago that it is considered rude to vomit on your brother . Might I have a closer look at your wolf ? ";Jon;Lannister,;-0.1;1182;42
Jon hesitated , then nodded slowly . " Can you climb down , or shall I bring a ladder ? ";Jon;Lannister,;-0.155555555556;1183;42
" Oh , bleed that , " the little man said .;Jon;Lannister,;-0.1875;1184;42
The dwarf dusted himself off and laughed . " I believe I 've frightened your wolf . My apologies . ";Jon;Lannister,;0.7;1188;42
" He 's not scared , " Jon said .;Jon;Lannister,;0.0;1189;42
He knelt and called out . " Ghost , come here . Come on . That 's it . ";Jon;Lannister,;0.0;1190;42
The wolf pup padded closer and nuzzled at Jon 's face , but he kept a wary eye on Tyrion Lannister , and when the dwarf reached out to pet him , he drew back and bared his fangs in a silent snarl . " Shy , is n't he ? ";Jon;Lannister,;-0.25;1191;42
" Sit , Ghost , " Jon commanded . " That 's it . Keep still . ";Jon;Lannister,;0.0;1193;42
He looked up at the dwarf . " You can touch him now . He wo n't move until I tell him to . I 've been training him . ";Jon;Lannister,;0.0;1194;42
" I see , " Lannister said .;Lannister;Jon,;0.0;1195;42
He ruffled the snow-white fur between Ghost 's ears and said , " Nice wolf . ";Jon;Lannister,;0.6;1196;42
" If I was n't here , he'd tear out your throat , " Jon said .;Jon;Lannister,;0.0;1197;42
" In that case , you had best stay close , " the dwarf said .;Jon;Lannister,;1.0;1199;42
He cocked his oversized head to one side and looked Jon over with his mismatched eyes . " I am Tyrion Lannister . ";Jon;Tyrion,;0.0;1200;42
" I know , " Jon said .;Jon;Lannister,;0.0;1201;42
" You 're Ned Stark 's bastard , are n't you ? ";Jon;Ned,;-0.2;1205;42
" Did I offend you ? ";Jon;Lannister,;0.0;1208;42
Lannister said . " Sorry . Dwarfs do n't have to be tactful . Generations of capering fools in motley have won me the right to dress badly and say any damn thing that comes into my head . ";Lannister;Jon,;0.128571428571;1209;42
He grinned . " You are the bastard , though . ";Jon;Lannister,;0.0;1210;42
" Lord Eddard Stark is my father , " Jon admitted stiffly .;Jon;Lord,;-0.2;1211;42
Lannister studied his face . " Yes , " he said . " I can see it . You have more of the north in you than your brothers . ";Lannister;Jon,;0.5;1212;42
" Half brothers , " Jon corrected .;Jon;Lannister,;-0.166666666667;1213;42
" Let me give you some counsel , bastard , " Lannister said . " Never forget what you are , for surely the world will not . Make it your strength . Then it can never be your weakness . Armor yourself in it , and it will never be used to hurt you . ";Lannister;Jon,;0.0;1215;42
Jon was in no mood for anyone 's counsel . " What do you know about being a bastard ? ";Jon;Lannister,;0.0;1216;42
" All dwarfs are bastards in their father 's eyes . ";Jon;Lannister,;0.0;1217;42
" You are your mother 's trueborn son of Lannister . ";Jon;Lannister,;0.0;1218;42
" Am I ? ";Jon;Lannister,;0.0;1219;42
the dwarf replied , sardonic . " Do tell my lord father . My mother died birthing me , and he 's never been sure . ";Jon;Lannister,;0.5;1220;42
" I do n't even know who my mother was , " Jon said .;Jon;Lannister,;0.0;1221;42
" Some woman , no doubt . Most of them are . ";Jon;Lannister,;0.5;1222;42
He favored Jon with a rueful grin . " Remember this , boy . All dwarfs may be bastards , yet not all bastards need be dwarfs . ";Jon;Lannister,;0.8;1223;42
" I will refuse him , " Ned said as he turned back to her .;Ned;Catelyn,Desmond,;0.0;1249;43
Catelyn sat up in the bed . " You cannot . You must not . ";Catelyn;Ned,Desmond,;0.0;1251;43
" My duties are here in the north . I have no wish to be Robert 's Hand . ";Ned;Robert,;0.0;1252;43
" He will not understand that . He is a king now , and kings are not like other men . If you refuse to serve him , he will wonder why , and sooner or later he will begin to suspect that you oppose him . Ca n't you see the danger that would put us in ? ";Catelyn;Ned,Desmond,;-0.0625;1253;43
Ned shook his head , refusing to believe . " Robert would never harm me or any of mine . We were closer than brothers . He loves me . If I refuse him , he will roar and curse and bluster , and in a week we will laugh about it together . I know the man ! ";Ned;Robert,;0.375;1254;43
" You knew the man , " she said . " The king is a stranger to you . ";Desmond;Ned,Catelyn,;0.0;1255;43
She had to make him see . " Pride is everything to a king , my lord . Robert came all this way to see you , to bring you these great honors , you cannot throw them back in his face . ";Catelyn;Pride,;0.4;1257;43
" Honors ? ";Desmond;Ned,Catelyn,;0.0;1258;43
" In his eyes , yes , " she said .;Ned;Catelyn,Desmond,;0.0;1260;43
" And in yours ? ";Catelyn;Ned,Desmond,;0.0;1261;43
" And in mine , " she blazed , angry now .;Ned;Catelyn,Desmond,;-0.5;1262;43
Why could n't he see ? " He offers his own son in marriage to our daughter , what else would you call that ? Sansa might someday be queen . Her sons could rule from the Wall to the mountains of Dorne . What is so wrong with that ? ";Catelyn;Sansa,;0.0666666666667;1263;43
" Gods , Catelyn , Sansa is only eleven , " Ned said . " And Joffrey ... Joffrey is ... ";Ned;Sansa,;0.0;1264;43
She finished for him . " ... crown prince , and heir to the Iron Throne . And I was only twelve when my father promised me to your brother Brandon . ";Catelyn;Ned,Desmond,;0.0;1265;43
That brought a bitter twist to Ned 's mouth . " Brandon . Yes . Brandon would know what to do . He always did . It was all meant for Brandon . You , Winterfell , everything . He was born to be a King 's Hand and a father to queens . I never asked for this cup to pass to me . ";Ned;Bran,King,;-0.1;1266;43
" Perhaps not , " Catelyn said , " but Brandon is dead , and the cup has passed , and you must drink from it , like it or not . ";Catelyn;Bran,;-0.2;1267;43
Ned turned , frowning . " What is it ? ";Ned;Catelyn,Desmond,;0.0;1273;43
Desmond 's voice came through the door . " My lord , Maester Luwin is without and begs urgent audience . ";Desmond;Maester,;0.0;1274;43
" You told him I had left orders not to be disturbed ? ";Ned;Catelyn,Desmond,;0.0;1275;43
" Yes , my lord . He insists . ";Catelyn;Ned,Desmond,;0.0;1276;43
" Very well . Send him in . ";Ned;Catelyn,Desmond,;0.2;1277;43
She sat up in bed and pulled the furs to her chin . " Perhaps we should close the windows , " she suggested .;Catelyn;Ned,Desmond,;0.0;1280;43
The maester waited until the door had closed behind him before he spoke . " My lord , " he said to Ned , " pardon for disturbing your rest . I have been left a message . ";Ned;Catelyn,Maester,Luwin,Arryn,Bran,Winterfell,;-0.25;1290;44
Ned looked irritated . " Been left ? By whom ? Has there been a rider ? I was not told . ";Ned;Catelyn,Maester,Luwin,Arryn,Bran,Winterfell,;0.0;1291;44
" There was no rider , my lord . Only a carved wooden box , left on a table in my observatory while I napped . My servants saw no one , but it must have been brought by someone in the king 's party . We have had no other visitors from the south . ";Maester;Ned,Catelyn,Luwin,Arryn,Bran,Winterfell,;-0.03125;1292;44
" A wooden box , you say ? ";Catelyn;Ned,Maester,Luwin,Arryn,Bran,Winterfell,;0.0;1293;44
" Inside was a fine new lens for the observatory , from Myr by the look of it . The lenscrafters of Myr are without equal . ";Ned;Myrcella,;0.184343434343;1295;44
He had little patience for this sort of thing , Catelyn knew . " A lens , " he said . " What has that to do with me ? ";Catelyn;Ned,Maester,Luwin,Arryn,Bran,Winterfell,;-0.1875;1297;44
" I asked the same question , " Maester Luwin said . " Clearly there was more to this than the seeming . ";Maester;Ned,Catelyn,Luwin,Arryn,Bran,Winterfell,;0.25;1298;44
Under the heavy weight of her furs , Catelyn shivered . " A lens is an instrument to help us see . ";Catelyn;Ned,Maester,Luwin,Arryn,Bran,Winterfell,;-0.2;1299;44
" Indeed it is . ";Ned;Catelyn,Maester,Luwin,Arryn,Bran,Winterfell,;0.0;1300;44
Catelyn could feel dread stirring inside her once again . " What is it that they would have us see more clearly ? ";Catelyn;Ned,Maester,Luwin,Arryn,Bran,Winterfell,;0.5;1302;44
" The very thing I asked myself . ";Ned;Catelyn,Maester,Luwin,Arryn,Bran,Winterfell,;0.2;1303;44
Maester Luwin drew a tightly rolled paper out of his sleeve . " I found the true message concealed within a false bottom when I dismantled the box the lens had come in , but it is not for my eyes . ";Maester;Ned,Catelyn,Luwin,Arryn,Bran,Winterfell,;-0.025;1304;44
Ned held out his hand . " Let me have it , then . ";Ned;Catelyn,Maester,Luwin,Arryn,Bran,Winterfell,;0.0;1305;44
Luwin did not stir . " Pardons , my lord . The message is not for you either . It is marked for the eyes of the Lady Catelyn , and her alone . May I approach ? ";Luwin;Ned,Catelyn,Maester,Arryn,Bran,Winterfell,;0.1;1306;44
" Stay , " Ned commanded him .;Ned;Catelyn,Maester,Luwin,Arryn,Bran,Winterfell,;0.0;1311;44
He looked at Catelyn . " What is it ? My lady , you 're shaking . ";Catelyn;Ned,Maester,Luwin,Arryn,Bran,Winterfell,;0.0;1313;44
" I 'm afraid , " she admitted .;Ned;Catelyn,Maester,Luwin,Arryn,Bran,Winterfell,;-0.6;1314;44
In the blue wax was the moon-and-falcon seal of House Arryn . " It 's from Lysa . ";Arryn;Ned,Catelyn,Maester,Luwin,Bran,Winterfell,;0.0;1317;44
Catelyn looked at her husband . " It will not make us glad , " she told him . " There is grief in this message , Ned . I can feel it . ";Catelyn;Ned,Maester,Luwin,Arryn,Bran,Winterfell,;-0.15;1318;44
Ned frowned , his face darkening . " Open it . ";Ned;Catelyn,Maester,Luwin,Arryn,Bran,Winterfell,;0.0;1319;44
Then she remembered . " Lysa took no chances . When we were girls together , we had a private language , she and I. ";Catelyn;Lysa,;0.0;1323;44
" Can you read it ? ";Ned;Catelyn,Maester,Luwin,Arryn,Bran,Winterfell,;0.0;1324;44
" Yes , " Catelyn admitted .;Catelyn;Ned,Maester,Luwin,Arryn,Bran,Winterfell,;0.0;1325;44
" Then tell us . ";Ned;Catelyn,Maester,Luwin,Arryn,Bran,Winterfell,;0.0;1326;44
" Perhaps I should withdraw , " Maester Luwin said .;Maester;Ned,Catelyn,Luwin,Arryn,Bran,Winterfell,;0.0;1327;44
" No , " Catelyn said . " We will need your counsel . ";Catelyn;Ned,Maester,Luwin,Arryn,Bran,Winterfell,;0.0;1328;44
Even Ned looked shocked . " What are you doing ? ";Ned;Catelyn,Maester,Luwin,Arryn,Bran,Winterfell,;-0.7;1332;44
" Lighting a fire , " Catelyn told him .;Catelyn;Ned,Maester,Luwin,Arryn,Bran,Winterfell,;0.0;1334;44
" Maester Luwin - " Ned began .;Ned;Catelyn,Maester,Luwin,Arryn,Bran,Winterfell,;0.0;1336;44
" Maester Luwin has delivered all my children , " Catelyn said . " This is no time for false modesty . ";Catelyn;Maester,;-0.4;1337;44
He held her there , his face inches from her . " My lady , tell me ! What was this message ? ";Ned;Catelyn,Maester,Luwin,Arryn,Bran,Winterfell,;0.0;1340;44
Catelyn stiffened in his grasp . " A warning , " she said softly . " If we have the wits to hear . ";Catelyn;Ned,Maester,Luwin,Arryn,Bran,Winterfell,;0.0;1341;44
His eyes searched her face . " Go on . ";Ned;Catelyn,Maester,Luwin,Arryn,Bran,Winterfell,;0.0;1342;44
" Lysa says Jon Arryn was murdered . ";Catelyn;Lysa,Jon,;0.0;1343;44
His fingers tightened on her arm . " By whom ? ";Maester;Ned,Catelyn,Luwin,Arryn,Bran,Winterfell,;0.0;1344;44
" The Lannisters , " she told him . " The queen . ";Ned;Catelyn,Maester,Luwin,Arryn,Bran,Winterfell,;0.0;1345;44
There were deep red marks on her skin . " Gods , " he whispered .;Catelyn;Ned,Maester,Luwin,Arryn,Bran,Winterfell,;0.0;1347;44
His voice was hoarse . " Your sister is sick with grief . She cannot know what she is saying . ";Ned;Catelyn,Maester,Luwin,Arryn,Bran,Winterfell,;-0.757142857143;1348;44
" She knows , " Catelyn said . " Lysa is impulsive , yes , but this message was carefully planned , cleverly hidden . She knew it meant death if her letter fell into the wrong hands . To risk so much , she must have had more than mere suspicion . ";Catelyn;Lysa,;-0.113333333333;1349;44
Catelyn looked to her husband . " Now we truly have no choice . You must be Robert 's Hand . You must go south with him and learn the truth . ";Catelyn;Robert,;0.0;1350;44
She saw at once that Ned had reached a very different conclusion . " The only truths I know are here . The south is a nest of adders I would do better to avoid . ";Ned;Catelyn,Maester,Luwin,Arryn,Bran,Winterfell,;0.166666666667;1351;44
Luwin plucked at his chain collar where it had chafed the soft skin of his throat . " The Hand of the King has great power , my lord . Power to find the truth of Lord Arryn 's death , to bring his killers to the king 's justice . Power to protect Lady Arryn and her son , if the worst be true . ";Luwin;King,;0.0625;1352;44
First the victory must be won , for her children 's sake . " You say you love Robert like a brother . Would you leave your brother surrounded by Lannisters ? ";Catelyn;Robert,;0.375;1355;44
" The Others take both of you , " Ned muttered darkly .;Ned;Catelyn,Maester,Luwin,Arryn,Bran,Winterfell,;0.0;1356;44
When he turned away from the window at last , his voice was tired and full of melancholy , and moisture glittered faintly in the corners of his eyes . " My father went south once , to answer the summons of a king . He never came home again . ";Catelyn;Ned,Maester,Luwin,Arryn,Bran,Winterfell,;-0.0166666666667;1360;44
" A different time , " Maester Luwin said . " A different king . ";Maester;Ned,Catelyn,Luwin,Arryn,Bran,Winterfell,;0.0;1361;44
" Yes , " Ned said dully .;Ned;Catelyn,Maester,Luwin,Arryn,Bran,Winterfell,;0.0;1362;44
He seated himself in a chair by the hearth . " Catelyn , you shall stay here in Winterfell . ";Catelyn;Ned,Maester,Luwin,Arryn,Bran,Winterfell,;0.0;1363;44
His words were like an icy draft through her heart . " No , " she said , suddenly afraid .;Maester;Ned,Catelyn,Luwin,Arryn,Bran,Winterfell,;-0.35;1364;44
" Yes , " Ned said , in words that would brook no argument . " You must govern the north in my stead , while I run Robert 's errands . There must always be a Stark in Winterfell . Robb is fourteen . Soon enough , he will be a man grown . He must learn to rule , and I will not be here for him . Make him part of your councils . He must be ready when his time comes . ";Ned;Robb,Robert,;0.0;1367;44
" Gods will , not for many years , " Maester Luwin murmured .;Maester;Gods,;0.5;1368;44
" Maester Luwin , I trust you as I would my own blood . Give my wife your voice in all things great and small . Teach my son the things he needs to know . Winter is coming . ";Ned;Winterfell,;0.383333333333;1369;44
Then silence fell , until Catelyn found her courage and asked the question whose answer she most dreaded . " What of the other children ? ";Catelyn;Ned,Maester,Luwin,Arryn,Bran,Winterfell,;0.1875;1371;44
Ned stood , and took her in his arms , and held her face close to his . " Rickon is very young , " he said gently . " He should stay here with you and Robb . The others I would take with me . ";Ned;Rickon,;0.13;1372;44
" I could not bear it , " Catelyn said , trembling .;Catelyn;Ned,Maester,Luwin,Arryn,Bran,Winterfell,;0.0;1373;44
" You must , " he said . " Sansa must wed Joffrey , that is clear now , we must give them no grounds to suspect our devotion . And it is past time that Arya learned the ways of a southron court . In a few years she will be of an age to marry too . ";Ned;Sansa,Arya,Joffrey,;-0.116666666667;1374;44
Never Bran . " Yes , " she said , " but please , Ned , for the love you bear me , let Bran remain here at Winterfell . He is only seven . ";Bran;Bran,;0.25;1378;44
" I was eight when my father sent me to foster at the Eyrie , " Ned said . " Ser Rodrik tells me there is bad feeling between Robb and Prince Joffrey . That is not healthy . Bran can bridge that distance . He is a sweet boy , quick to laugh , easy to love . Let him grow up with the young princes , let him become their friend as Robert became mine . Our House will be the safer for it . ";Ned;Rodrik,Robert,;0.2375;1379;44
Winterfell was such a vast place . " Keep him off the walls , then , " she said bravely . " You know how Bran loves to climb . ";Winterfell;Bran,;0.0;1385;44
Ned kissed the tears from her eyes before they could fall . " Thank you , my lady , " he whispered . " This is hard , I know . ";Ned;Catelyn,Maester,Luwin,Arryn,Bran,Winterfell,;-0.291666666667;1386;44
" What of Jon Snow , my lord ? ";Catelyn;Ned,Maester,Luwin,Arryn,Bran,Winterfell,;0.0;1387;44
Ned brought his bastard home with him , and called him " son " for all the north to see .;Ned;;0.0;1400;45
That was the only time in all their years that Ned had ever frightened her . " Never ask me about Jon , " he said , cold as ice . " He is my blood , and that is all you need to know . And now I will learn where you heard that name , my lady . ";Ned;Jon,;-0.3;1408;46
Somehow that made it worse . " Jon must go , " she said now .;Maester;Jon,;-0.4;1415;47
" He and Robb are close , " Ned said . " I had hoped ... ";Ned;Robb,;0.0;1416;47
" He cannot stay here , " Catelyn said , cutting him off . " He is your son , not mine . I will not have him . ";Catelyn;Ned,Maester,;-0.6;1417;47
The look Ned gave her was anguished . " You know I cannot take him south . There will be no place for him at court . A boy with a bastard 's name ... you know what they will say of him . He will be shunned . ";Ned;Catelyn,Maester,;0.0;1420;47
Catelyn armored her heart against the mute appeal in her husband 's eyes . " They say your friend Robert has fathered a dozen bastards himself . ";Maester;Robert,;0.0;1421;47
" And none of them has ever been seen at court ! ";Catelyn;Ned,Maester,;0.0;1422;47
Ned blazed . " The Lannister woman has seen to that . How can you be so damnably cruel , Catelyn ? He is only a boy . He - ";Ned;Catelyn,Maester,;-0.5;1423;47
He might have said more , and worse , but Maester Luwin cut in . " Another solution presents itself , " he said , his voice quiet . " Your brother Benjen came to me about Jon a few days ago . It seems the boy aspires to take the black . ";Maester;brother,;-0.0533333333333;1425;47
Ned looked shocked . " He asked to join the Night 's Watch ? ";Ned;Night,;-0.7;1426;47
Maester Luwin said , " There is great honor in service on the Wall , my lord . ";Maester;Ned,;0.8;1435;48
" And even a bastard may rise high in the Night 's Watch , " Ned reflected .;Ned;Maester,;0.16;1436;48
Still , his voice was troubled . " Jon is so young . If he asked this when he was a man grown , that would be one thing , but a boy of fourteen ... ";Maester;Jon,;-0.2;1437;48
" A hard sacrifice , " Maester Luwin agreed . " Yet these are hard times , my lord . His road is no crueler than yours or your lady ' s. ";Maester;Ned,;-0.291666666667;1438;48
Finally he sighed , and turned back . " Very well , " he said to Maester Luwin . " I suppose it is for the best . I will speak to Ben . ";Maester;Ned,;0.4;1442;48
" When shall we tell Jon ? ";Maester;Jon,;0.0;1443;48
" When I must . Preparations must be made . It will be a fortnight before we are ready to depart . I would sooner let Jon enjoy these last few days . Summer will end soon enough , and childhood as well . When the time comes , I will tell him myself . ";Maester;Preparations,Jon,;0.08;1445;48
Everyone said so . " Sansa 's work is as pretty as she is , " Septa Mordane told their lady mother once . " She has such fine , delicate hands . ";Mordane;Catelyn,;0.0916666666667;1452;49
When Lady Catelyn had asked about Arya , the septa had sniffed . " Arya has the hands of a blacksmith . ";Catelyn;Arya,;0.0;1453;49
" What are you talking about ? ";Sansa;Arya,Jeyne,Winterfell,Beth,Mordane,Prince,;0.0;1462;50
" Tell me , " Arya said .;Arya;Sansa,Jeyne,Winterfell,Beth,Mordane,Prince,;0.0;1468;50
" We were talking about the prince , " Sansa said , her voice soft as a kiss .;Sansa;Arya,Jeyne,Winterfell,Beth,Mordane,Prince,;0.1;1471;50
" Joffrey likes your sister , " Jeyne whispered , proud as if she had something to do with it .;Jeyne;Joffrey,;0.8;1477;50
She was the daughter of Winterfell 's steward and Sansa 's dearest friend . " He told her she was very beautiful . ";Winterfell;Arya,Sansa,Jeyne,Beth,Mordane,Prince,;1.0;1478;50
" He 's going to marry her , " little Beth said dreamily , hugging herself . " Then Sansa will be queen of all the realm . ";Beth;Sansa,;-0.1875;1479;50
She did everything prettily , Arya thought with dull resentment . " Beth , you should n't make up stories , " Sansa corrected the younger girl , gently stroking her hair to take the harshness out of her words .;Arya;Sansa,Jeyne,Winterfell,Beth,Mordane,Prince,;-0.145833333333;1482;50
She looked at Arya . " What did you think of Prince Joff , sister ? He 's very gallant , do n't you think ? ";Arya;Sansa,Jeyne,Winterfell,Beth,Mordane,Prince,;0.2;1483;50
" Jon says he looks like a girl , " Arya said .;Arya;Jon,;0.0;1484;50
Sansa sighed as she stitched . " Poor Jon , " she said . " He gets jealous because he 's a bastard . ";Sansa;Arya,Jeyne,Winterfell,Beth,Mordane,Prince,;-0.4;1485;50
" He 's our brother , " Arya said , much too loudly .;Arya;Sansa,Jeyne,Winterfell,Beth,Mordane,Prince,;0.1;1486;50
It was frowning now . " What are you talking about , children ? ";Jeyne;Arya,Sansa,Winterfell,Beth,Mordane,Prince,;0.0;1490;50
" Our half brother , " Sansa corrected , soft and precise .;Sansa;Arya,Jeyne,Winterfell,Beth,Mordane,Prince,;0.111111111111;1491;50
She smiled for the septa . " Arya and I were remarking on how pleased we were to have the princess with us today , " she said .;Arya;Sansa,Jeyne,Winterfell,Beth,Mordane,Prince,;0.55;1492;50
Septa Mordane nodded . " Indeed . A great honor for us all . ";Mordane;Arya,Sansa,Jeyne,Winterfell,Beth,Prince,;0.8;1493;50
Princess Myrcella smiled uncertainly at the compliment . " Arya , why are n't you at work ? ";Prince;Arya,Sansa,Jeyne,Winterfell,Beth,Mordane,;0.6;1494;50
She rose to her feet , starched skirts rustling as she started across the room . " Let me see your stitches . ";Arya;Sansa,Jeyne,Winterfell,Beth,Mordane,Prince,;0.6;1496;50
It was just like Sansa to go and attract the septa 's attention . " Here , " she said , surrendering up her work .;Sansa;Arya,Jeyne,Winterfell,Beth,Mordane,Prince,;0.0;1498;50
The septa examined the fabric . " Arya , Arya , Arya , " she said . " This will not do . This will not do at all . ";Arya;Sansa,Jeyne,Winterfell,Beth,Mordane,Prince,;0.0;1499;50
Septa Mordane called after her . " Arya , come back here ! Do n't you take another step ! Your lady mother will hear of this . In front of our royal princess too ! You 'll shame us all ! ";Mordane;Myrcella,Arya,;0.0;1506;51
She managed a stiff little bow to Myrcella . " By your leave , my lady . ";Myrcella;Mordane,Arya,;-0.200892857143;1509;51
But if she was uncertain , Septa Mordane was not . " Just where do you think you are going , Arya ? ";Mordane;Myrcella,Arya,;0.0;1511;51
Arya glared at her . " I have to go shoe a horse , " she said sweetly , taking a brief satisfaction in the shock on the septa 's face .;Arya;Mordane,Myrcella,;0.0;1513;51
Sansa , of course , had named her pup " Lady . ";Sansa;;0.0;1544;52
She wanted to see Robb put gallant Prince Joffrey flat on his back . " Come , " she whispered to Nymeria .;Robb;;-0.0125;1552;53
Jon gave her a curious look . " Should n't you be working on your stitches , little sister ? ";Jon;Arya,;-0.14375;1560;54
Arya made a face at him . " I wanted to see them fight . ";Arya;Jon,;0.0;1561;54
He smiled . " Come here , then . ";Jon;Arya,;0.6;1562;54
" A shade more exhausting than needlework , " Jon observed .;Jon;Arya,;0.5;1571;55
" A shade more fun than needlework , " Arya gave back at him .;Arya;Jon,;0.266666666667;1572;55
" Why are n't you down in the yard ? ";Jon;Arya,Tom,Rodrik,Robb,Greyjoy,Joffrey,;-0.155555555556;1581;56
He gave her a half smile . " Bastards are not allowed to damage young princes , " he said . " Any bruises they take in the practice yard must come from trueborn swords . ";Rodrik;Jon,Arya,Tom,Robb,Greyjoy,Joffrey,;0.0777777777778;1583;56
" Oh. " Arya felt abashed .;Arya;Jon,Tom,Rodrik,Robb,Greyjoy,Joffrey,;0.0;1584;56
She watched her little brother whack at Tommen . " I could do just as good as Bran , " she said . " He 's only seven . I 'm nine . ";Tom;Jon,Arya,Rodrik,Robb,Greyjoy,Joffrey,;0.154166666667;1587;56
Jon looked her over with all his fourteen-year-old wisdom . " You 're too skinny , " he said .;Jon;Arya,Tom,Rodrik,Robb,Greyjoy,Joffrey,;0.0;1588;56
Then he sighed and shook his head . " I doubt you could even lift a longsword , little sister , never mind swing one . ";Rodrik;Jon,Arya,Tom,Robb,Greyjoy,Joffrey,;-0.1875;1590;56
" You see Prince Joffrey ? ";Joffrey;Joffrey,;0.0;1594;56
" Look at the arms on his surcoat , " Jon suggested .;Jon;Arya,Tom,Rodrik,Robb,Greyjoy,Joffrey,;0.0;1599;56
" The Lannisters are proud , " Jon observed . " You'd think the royal sigil would be sufficient , but no . He makes his mother 's House equal in honor to the king ' s. ";Jon;Lannister,;0.4;1604;56
" The woman is important too ! ";Rodrik;Jon,Arya,Tom,Robb,Greyjoy,Joffrey,;0.5;1605;56
Jon chuckled . " Perhaps you should do the same thing , little sister . Wed Tully to Stark in your arms . ";Jon;Tully,;-0.129166666667;1607;56
" A wolf with a fish in its mouth ? ";Rodrik;Jon,Arya,Tom,Robb,Greyjoy,Joffrey,;0.0;1608;56
It made her laugh . " That would look silly . Besides , if a girl ca n't fight , why should she have a coat of arms ? ";Joffrey;Jon,Arya,Tom,Rodrik,Robb,Greyjoy,;-0.1;1609;56
Jon shrugged . " Girls get the arms but not the swords . Bastards get the swords but not the arms . I did not make the rules , little sister . ";Jon;Girls,;-0.1875;1610;56
" Enough ! ";Joffrey;Jon,Arya,Tom,Rodrik,Robb,Greyjoy,;0.0;1616;56
He gave the prince a hand and yanked him back to his feet . " Well fought . Lew , Donnis , help them out of their armor . ";Rodrik;Jon,Arya,Tom,Robb,Greyjoy,Joffrey,;0.0;1618;56
He looked around . " Prince Joffrey , Robb , will you go another round ? ";Jon;Arya,Tom,Rodrik,Robb,Greyjoy,Joffrey,;-0.2;1619;56
Robb , already sweaty from a previous bout , moved forward eagerly . " Gladly . ";Robb;Jon,Arya,Tom,Rodrik,Greyjoy,Joffrey,;-0.166666666667;1620;56
He looked bored . " This is a game for children , Ser Rodrik . ";Jon;Arya,Tom,Rodrik,Robb,Greyjoy,Joffrey,;-0.45;1623;56
Theon Greyjoy gave a sudden bark of laughter . " You are children , " he said derisively .;Greyjoy;Jon,Arya,Tom,Rodrik,Robb,Joffrey,;0.0;1624;56
" Robb may be a child , " Joffrey said . " I am a prince . And I grow tired of swatting at Starks with a play sword . ";Joffrey;Robb,;-0.4;1625;56
" You got more swats than you gave , Joff , " Robb said . " Are you afraid ? ";Robb;Jon,Arya,Tom,Rodrik,Greyjoy,Joffrey,;-0.05;1626;56
Prince Joffrey looked at him . " Oh , terrified , " he said . " You 're so much older . ";Joffrey;Jon,Arya,Tom,Rodrik,Robb,Greyjoy,;0.166666666667;1627;56
Jon looked down on the scene with a frown . " Joffrey is truly a little shit , " he told Arya .;Jon;Joffrey,;-0.181018518519;1629;56
Ser Rodrik tugged thoughtfully at his white whiskers . " What are you suggesting ? ";Rodrik;Jon,Arya,Tom,Robb,Greyjoy,Joffrey,;0.0;1630;56
" Live steel . ";Jon;Arya,Tom,Rodrik,Robb,Greyjoy,Joffrey,;0.136363636364;1632;56
" Done , " Robb shot back . " You 'll be sorry ! ";Rodrik;Jon,Arya,Tom,Robb,Greyjoy,Joffrey,;-0.3125;1633;56
The master-at-arms put a hand on Robb 's shoulder to quiet him . " Live steel is too dangerous . I will permit you tourney swords , with blunted edges . ";Robb;Jon,Arya,Tom,Rodrik,Greyjoy,Joffrey,;-0.154545454545;1634;56
Joffrey said nothing , but a man strange to Arya , a tall knight with black hair and burn scars on his face , pushed forward in front of the prince . " This is your prince . Who are you to tell him he may not have an edge on his sword , ser ? ";Joffrey;Jon,Arya,Tom,Rodrik,Robb,Greyjoy,;-0.108333333333;1635;56
" Master-at-arms of Winterfell , Clegane , and you would do well not to forget it . ";Jon;Arya,Tom,Rodrik,Robb,Greyjoy,Joffrey,;0.0;1636;56
" Are you training women here ? ";Joffrey;Jon,Arya,Tom,Rodrik,Robb,Greyjoy,;0.0;1637;56
" I am training knights , " Ser Rodrik said pointedly . " They will have steel when they are ready . When they are of an age . ";Rodrik;Jon,Arya,Tom,Robb,Greyjoy,Joffrey,;0.2;1640;56
The burned man looked at Robb . " How old are you , boy ? ";Robb;Jon,Arya,Tom,Rodrik,Greyjoy,Joffrey,;0.1;1641;56
" Fourteen , " Robb said .;Robb;Jon,Arya,Tom,Rodrik,Greyjoy,Joffrey,;0.0;1642;56
" I killed a man at twelve . You can be sure it was not with a blunt sword . ";Jon;Arya,Tom,Rodrik,Robb,Greyjoy,Joffrey,;0.5;1643;56
He turned on Ser Rodrik . " Let me do it . I can beat him . ";Rodrik;Jon,Arya,Tom,Robb,Greyjoy,Joffrey,;0.0;1646;56
" Beat him with a tourney blade , then , " Ser Rodrik said .;Rodrik;Jon,Arya,Tom,Robb,Greyjoy,Joffrey,;0.0;1647;56
Joffrey shrugged . " Come and see me when you 're older , Stark . If you 're not too old . ";Joffrey;Jon,Arya,Tom,Rodrik,Robb,Greyjoy,;0.0222222222222;1648;56
Joffrey feigned a yawn and turned to his younger brother . " Come , Tommen , " he said . " The hour of play is done . Leave the children to their frolics . ";Joffrey;Jon,Arya,Tom,Rodrik,Robb,Greyjoy,;0.0;1654;56
Finally he climbed down off the window . " The show is done , " he said .;Jon;Arya,Tom,Rodrik,Robb,Greyjoy,Joffrey,;-0.155555555556;1660;56
The white wolf rose and rubbed against him . " You had best run back to your room , little sister . Septa Mordane will surely be lurking . The longer you hide , the sterner the penance . You 'll be sewing all through winter . When the spring thaw comes , they will find your body with a needle still locked tight between your frozen fingers . ";Rodrik;Mordane,;0.205654761905;1662;56
Arya did n't think it was funny . " I hate needlework ! ";Arya;Jon,Tom,Rodrik,Robb,Greyjoy,Joffrey,;-0.34375;1663;56
she said with passion . " It 's not fair ! ";Rodrik;Jon,Arya,Tom,Robb,Greyjoy,Joffrey,;0.875;1664;56
" Nothing is fair , " Jon said .;Jon;Arya,Tom,Rodrik,Robb,Greyjoy,Joffrey,;0.7;1665;56
After the hunt had ridden out , he wandered through the castle with his wolf at his side , intending to visit the ones who would be left behind , Old Nan and Gage the cook , Mikken in his smithy , Hodor the stableboy who smiled so much and took care of his pony and never said anything but " Hodor , " the man in the glass gardens who gave him a blackberry when he came to visit ...;Nan;;0.08;1718;57
His wolf came sprinting at his heels . " You stay here , " he told him at the base of the sentinel tree near the armory wall . " Lie down . That 's right . Now stay . ";Bran;;-0.14246031746;1735;58
Once more the wolf howled . " Quiet , " he yelled . " Sit down . Stay . You 're worse than Mother . ";Winterfell;;-0.0138888888889;1743;59
As angry as he was , his father could not help but laugh . " You 're not my son , " he told Bran when they fetched him down , " you 're a squirrel . So be it . If you must climb , then climb , but try not to let your mother see you . ";Bran;;-0.118518518519;1770;60
That had been fun , but afterward Bran just looked at the maester and said , " I 'm not made of clay . And anyhow , I never fall . ";Bran;;0.3;1778;61
" I do not like it , " a woman was saying .;Bran;;0.0;1811;62
There was a row of windows beneath him , and the voice was drifting out of the last window on this side . " You should be the Hand . ";Bran;;0.0;1812;62
" Gods forbid , " a man 's voice replied lazily . " It 's not an honor I'd want . There 's far too much work involved . ";Bran;Gods,I'd,;0.1;1813;62
" Do n't you see the danger this puts us in ? ";Bran;;0.0;1816;62
the woman said . " Robert loves the man like a brother . ";Bran;Robert,;0.0;1817;62
" Robert can barely stomach his brothers . Not that I blame him . Stannis would be enough to give anyone indigestion . ";Bran;Robert,;0.0;1818;62
" Do n't play the fool . Stannis and Renly are one thing , and Eddard Stark is quite another . Robert will listen to Stark . Damn them both . I should have insisted that he name you , but I was certain Stark would refuse him . ";Bran;Renly,Robert,certain,;-0.0964285714286;1819;62
" We ought to count ourselves fortunate , " the man said . " The king might as easily have named one of his brothers , or even Littlefinger , gods help us . Give me honorable enemies rather than ambitious ones , and I 'll sleep more easily by night . ";Bran;;0.383333333333;1820;62
" We will have to watch him carefully , " the woman said .;Bran;;0.0;1825;62
" I would sooner watch you , " the man said .;Bran;;0.0;1826;62
He sounded bored . " Come back here . ";Bran;;-0.25;1827;62
" Lord Eddard has never taken any interest in anything that happened south of the Neck , " the woman said . " Never . I tell you , he means to move against us . Why else would he leave the seat of his power ? ";Bran;Lord,;0.0;1828;62
" A hundred reasons . Duty . Honor . He yearns to write his name large across the book of history , to get away from his wife , or both . Perhaps he just wants to be warm for once in his life . ";Bran;;0.338095238095;1829;62
" His wife is Lady Arryn 's sister . It 's a wonder Lysa was not here to greet us with her accusations . ";Bran;Lysa,;0.0;1830;62
" You fret too much . Lysa Arryn is a frightened cow . ";Bran;Arryn,;0.1;1836;62
" That frightened cow shared Jon Arryn 's bed . ";Bran;Jon,;0.0;1837;62
" If she knew anything , she would have gone to Robert before she fled King 's Landing . ";Bran;King,;0.0;1838;62
" When he had already agreed to foster that weakling son of hers at Casterly Rock ? I think not . She knew the boy 's life would be hostage to her silence . She may grow bolder now that he 's safe atop the Eyrie . ";Bran;Rock,;0.5;1839;62
" Mothers . ";Bran;;0.0;1840;62
The man made the word sound like a curse . " I think birthing does something to your minds . You are all mad . ";Bran;;-0.1125;1841;62
It was a bitter sound . " Let Lady Arryn grow as bold as she likes . Whatever she knows , whatever she thinks she knows , she has no proof . ";Bran;Arryn,;0.211111111111;1843;62
He paused a moment . " Or does she ? ";Bran;;0.0;1844;62
" Do you think the king will require proof ? ";Bran;;0.0;1845;62
the woman said . " I tell you , he loves me not . ";Bran;;0.0;1846;62
" And whose fault is that , sweet sister ? ";Bran;;0.35;1847;62
" You are as blind as Robert , " the woman was saying .;Bran;;-0.5;1853;62
" If you mean I see the same thing , yes , " the man said . " I see a man who would sooner die than betray his king . ";Bran;;-0.15625;1854;62
" He betrayed one already , or have you forgotten ? ";Bran;;0.0;1855;62
the woman said . " Oh , I do n't deny he 's loyal to Robert , that 's obvious . What happens when Robert dies and Joff takes the throne ? And the sooner that comes to pass , the safer we 'll all be . My husband grows more restless every day . Having Stark beside him will only make him worse . He 's still in love with the sister , the insipid little dead sixteen-year-old . How long till he decides to put me aside for some new Lyanna ? ";Bran;Robert,Stark,;0.0392906336088;1856;62
The man sighed . " You should think less about the future and more about the pleasures at hand . ";Bran;;0.111111111111;1862;62
" Stop that ! ";Bran;;0.0;1863;62
" All this talk is getting very tiresome , sister , " the man said . " Come here and be quiet . ";Bran;;-0.325;1869;62
The man had a hand down between her legs , and he must have been hurting her there , because the woman started to moan , low in her throat . " Stop it , " she said , " stop it , stop it . Oh , please ... ";Bran;;-0.0777777777778;1882;63
" He saw us , " the woman said shrilly .;Bran;;0.0;1905;64
" So he did , " the man said .;Bran;;0.0;1906;64
The man reached down . " Take my hand , " he said . " Before you fall . ";Bran;;-0.155555555556;1910;64
The man yanked him up to the ledge . " What are you doing ? ";Bran;;0.0;1912;64
He stood Bran up on the sill . " How old are you , boy ? ";Bran;;0.1;1916;64
" Seven , " Bran said , shaking with relief .;Bran;;0.0;1917;64
The man looked over at the woman . " The things I do for love , " he said with loathing .;Bran;;0.5;1920;64
A life of the Grand Maester Aethelmure , no wonder . " Chayle , " he said softly .;Grand;Clegane,Tyrion,Joffrey,;0.5;1942;65
The young man jerked up , blinking , confused , the crystal of his order swinging wildly on its silver chain . " I 'm off to break my fast . See that you return the books to the shelves . Be gentle with the Valyrian scrolls , the parchment is very dry . Ayrmidon 's Engines of War is quite rare , and yours is the only complete copy I 've ever seen . ";Tyrion;Warden,;0.0516666666667;1943;65
Sandor Clegane 's rasping voice drifted up to him . " The boy is a long time dying . I wish he would be quicker about it . ";Clegane;Grand,Tyrion,Joffrey,;-0.05;1949;65
Tyrion glanced down and saw the Hound standing with young Joffrey as squires swarmed around them . " At least he dies quietly , " the prince replied . " It 's the wolf that makes the noise . I could scarce sleep last night . ";Tyrion;Grand,Clegane,Joffrey,;-0.0888888888889;1950;65
Clegane cast a long shadow across the hard-packed earth as his squire lowered the black helm over his head . " I could silence the creature , if it please you , " he said through his open visor .;Clegane;Grand,Tyrion,Joffrey,;-0.0722222222222;1951;65
The notion seemed to delight the prince . " Send a dog to kill a dog ! ";Tyrion;Grand,Clegane,Joffrey,;0.0;1955;65
he exclaimed . " Winterfell is so infested with wolves , the Starks would never miss one . ";Clegane;Winterfell,;0.0;1956;65
Tyrion hopped off the last step onto the yard . " I beg to differ , nephew , " he said . " The Starks can count past six . Unlike some princes I might name . ";Tyrion;Stark,;-0.125;1957;65
" A voice from nowhere , " Sandor said .;Clegane;Grand,Tyrion,Joffrey,;0.0;1959;65
He peered through his helm , looking this way and that . " Spirits of the air ! ";Joffrey;Grand,Clegane,Tyrion,;0.0;1960;65
Tyrion was used to it . " Down here . ";Tyrion;Grand,Clegane,Joffrey,;-0.155555555556;1962;65
The tall man peered down at the ground , and pretended to notice him . " The little lord Tyrion , " he said . " My pardons . I did not see you standing there . ";Clegane;Grand,Tyrion,Joffrey,;-0.171527777778;1963;65
" I am in no mood for your insolence today . ";Joffrey;Grand,Clegane,Tyrion,;0.0;1964;65
Tyrion turned to his nephew . " Joffrey , it is past time you called on Lord Eddard and his lady , to offer them your comfort . ";Tyrion;Grand,Clegane,Joffrey,;-0.25;1965;65
Joffrey looked as petulant as only a boy prince can look . " What good will my comfort do them ? ";Joffrey;Grand,Clegane,Tyrion,;0.325;1966;65
" None , " Tyrion said . " Yet it is expected of you . Your absence has been noted . ";Tyrion;Grand,Clegane,Joffrey,;-0.1;1967;65
" The Stark boy is nothing to me , " Joffrey said . " I cannot abide the wailing of women . ";Joffrey;Grand,Clegane,Tyrion,;-0.2;1968;65
" One word , " Tyrion said , " and I will hit you again . ";Tyrion;Grand,Clegane,Joffrey,;0.0;1971;65
" I 'm going to tell Mother ! ";Clegane;Mother,;0.0;1972;65
" You tell your mother , " Tyrion told him . " But first you get yourself to Lord and Lady Stark , and you fall to your knees in front of them , and you tell them how very sorry you are , and that you are at their service if there is the slightest thing you can do for them or theirs in this desperate hour , and that all your prayers go with them . Do you understand ? Do you ? ";Tyrion;Grand,Clegane,Joffrey,;-0.3;1976;65
" The prince will remember that , little lord , " the Hound warned him .;Hound;Tyrion,Jaime,;-0.1875;1986;66
" I pray he does , " Tyrion Lannister replied . " If he forgets , be a good dog and remind him . ";Tyrion;Hound,Jaime,;0.65;1988;66
He glanced around the courtyard . " Do you know where I might find my brother ? ";Jaime;Hound,Tyrion,;0.0;1989;66
" Breaking fast with the queen . ";Hound;Tyrion,Jaime,;0.2;1990;66
" Ah , " Tyrion said .;Tyrion;Hound,Jaime,;0.0;1991;66
" Is Robert still abed ? ";Jaime;Robert,;0.0;1997;66
His sister peered at him with the same expression of faint distaste she had worn since the day he was born . " The king has not slept at all , " she told him . " He is with Lord Eddard . He has taken their sorrow deeply to heart . ";Tyrion;Hound,Jaime,;-0.25;1999;66
" He has a large heart , our Robert , " Jaime said with a lazy smile .;Jaime;Hound,Tyrion,;0.0880952380952;2000;66
A servant approached . " Bread , " Tyrion told him , " and two of those little fish , and a mug of that good dark beer to wash them down . Oh , and some bacon . Burn it until it turns black . ";Tyrion;Hound,Jaime,;-0.00194444444444;2004;66
Prince Tommen spoke up . " Do you have news of Bran , Uncle ? ";Tom;Tyrion,Jaime,Cersei,Lannister,;0.0;2014;67
" I stopped by the sickroom last night , " Tyrion announced . " There was no change . The maester thought that a hopeful sign . ";Tyrion;Tom,Jaime,Cersei,Lannister,;0.0;2015;67
" I do n't want Brandon to die , " Tommen said timorously .;Tom;Bran,;0.0;2016;67
" Lord Eddard had a brother named Brandon as well , " Jaime mused . " One of the hostages murdered by Targaryen . It seems to be an unlucky name . ";Jaime;Lord,Bran,;0.0;2019;67
" Oh , not so unlucky as all that , surely , " Tyrion said .;Tyrion;Tom,Jaime,Cersei,Lannister,;0.0;2020;67
Cersei was studying him warily . " What do you mean ? ";Cersei;Tom,Tyrion,Jaime,Lannister,;-0.3125;2023;67
Tyrion gave her a crooked smile . " Why , only that Tommen may get his wish . The maester thinks the boy may yet live . ";Tyrion;Tom,;0.109090909091;2024;67
Then his sister dropped her gaze to the table . " That is no mercy . These northern gods are cruel to let the child linger in such pain . ";Jaime;Tom,Tyrion,Cersei,Lannister,;-0.5;2028;67
" What were the maester 's words ? ";Cersei;Tom,Tyrion,Jaime,Lannister,;0.0;2029;67
Tyrion chewed thoughtfully for a moment and said , " He thinks that if the boy were going to die , he would have done so already . It has been four days with no change . ";Tyrion;Tom,Jaime,Cersei,Lannister,;0.0;2032;67
" Will Bran get better , Uncle ? ";Jaime;Bran,;0.5;2033;67
" His back is broken , little one , " Tyrion told her . " The fall shattered his legs as well . They keep him alive with honey and water , or he would starve to death . Perhaps , if he wakes , he will be able to eat real food , but he will never walk again . ";Tyrion;Tom,Jaime,Cersei,Lannister,;0.01875;2036;67
" If he wakes , " Cersei repeated . " Is that likely ? ";Cersei;Tom,Tyrion,Jaime,Lannister,;0.0;2037;67
" The gods alone know , " Tyrion told her . " The maester only hopes . ";Tyrion;Tom,Jaime,Cersei,Lannister,;0.0;2038;67
He chewed some more bread . " I would swear that wolf of his is keeping the boy alive . The creature is outside his window day and night , howling . Every time they chase it away , it returns . The maester said they closed the window once , to shut out the noise , and Bran seemed to weaken . When they opened it again , his heart beat stronger . ";Jaime;Bran,;0.125;2039;67
The queen shuddered . " There is something unnatural about those animals , " she said . " They are dangerous . I will not have any of them coming south with us . ";Tyrion;Tom,Jaime,Cersei,Lannister,;-0.6;2040;67
Jaime said , " You 'll have a hard time stopping them , sister . They follow those girls everywhere . ";Jaime;Tom,Tyrion,Cersei,Lannister,;-0.291666666667;2041;67
Tyrion started on his fish . " Are you leaving soon , then ? ";Tyrion;Tom,Jaime,Cersei,Lannister,;0.0;2042;67
" Not near soon enough , " Cersei said .;Cersei;Tom,Tyrion,Jaime,Lannister,;0.05;2043;67
Then she frowned . " Are we leaving ? ";Tyrion;Tom,Jaime,Cersei,Lannister,;0.0;2044;67
she echoed . " What about you ? Gods , do n't tell me you are staying here ? ";Jaime;Tom,Tyrion,Cersei,Lannister,;0.0;2045;67
Tyrion shrugged . " Benjen Stark is returning to the Night 's Watch with his brother 's bastard . I have a mind to go with them and see this Wall we have all heard so much of . ";Tyrion;Stark,;-0.05;2046;67
Jaime smiled . " I hope you 're not thinking of taking the black on us , sweet brother . ";Jaime;Tom,Tyrion,Cersei,Lannister,;0.261111111111;2047;67
Tyrion laughed . " What , me , celibate ? The whores would go begging from Dorne to Casterly Rock . No , I just want to stand on top of the Wall and piss off the edge of the world . ";Tyrion;Tom,Jaime,Cersei,Lannister,;0.6;2048;67
Cersei stood abruptly . " The children do n't need to hear this filth . Tommen , Myrcella , come . ";Cersei;Tom,Tyrion,Jaime,Lannister,;0.0;2049;67
Jaime Lannister regarded his brother thoughtfully with those cool green eyes . " Stark will never consent to leave Winterfell with his son lingering in the shadow of death . ";Lannister;Stark,Winterfell,;-0.0166666666667;2051;67
" He will if Robert commands it , " Tyrion said . " And Robert will command it . There is nothing Lord Eddard can do for the boy in any case . ";Tyrion;Robert,Lord,;0.0;2052;67
" He could end his torment , " Jaime said . " I would , if it were my son . It would be a mercy . ";Jaime;Tom,Tyrion,Cersei,Lannister,;0.0;2053;67
" I advise against putting that suggestion to Lord Eddard , sweet brother , " Tyrion said . " He would not take it kindly . ";Tyrion;Tom,Jaime,Cersei,Lannister,;0.35;2054;67
" Even if the boy does live , he will be a cripple . Worse than a cripple . A grotesque . Give me a good clean death . ";Jaime;Tom,Tyrion,Cersei,Lannister,;0.0406060606061;2055;67
Tyrion replied with a shrug that accentuated the twist of his shoulders . " Speaking for the grotesques , " he said , " I beg to differ . Death is so terribly final , while life is full of possibilities . ";Tyrion;Tom,Jaime,Cersei,Lannister,;0.175;2056;67
Jaime smiled . " You are a perverse little imp , are n't you ? ";Jaime;Tom,Tyrion,Cersei,Lannister,;0.20625;2057;67
" Oh , yes , " Tyrion admitted . " I hope the boy does wake . I would be most interested to hear what he might have to say . ";Tyrion;Tom,Jaime,Cersei,Lannister,;0.375;2058;67
His brother 's smile curdled like sour milk . " Tyrion , my sweet brother , " he said darkly , " there are times when you give me cause to wonder whose side you are on . ";Cersei;Tom,Tyrion,Jaime,Lannister,;0.325;2059;67
He took a swallow of strong black beer to wash it all down , and grinned up wolfishly at Jaime . " Why , Jaime , my sweet brother , " he said , " you wound me . You know how much I love my family . ";Jaime;Tom,Tyrion,Cersei,Lannister,;0.176851851852;2061;67
Finally she blinked . " What are you doing here ? ";Bran;Jon,Brothers,;0.0;2087;68
" I came to see Bran , " Jon said . " To say good-bye . ";Jon;Bran,;0.0;2089;68
She looked as though she had aged twenty years . " You 've said it . Now go away . ";Brothers;Jon,Bran,;-0.1;2092;68
He took a nervous step into the room . " Please , " he said .;Bran;Jon,Brothers,;0.0;2094;68
Something cold moved in her eyes . " I told you to leave , " she said . " We do n't want you here . ";Jon;Bran,Brothers,;-0.6;2095;68
He would be a Sworn Brother of the Night 's Watch soon , and face worse dangers than Catelyn Tully Stark . " He 's my brother , " he said .;Brothers;Jon,Bran,;-0.3;2099;68
" Shall I call the guards ? ";Bran;Jon,Brothers,;0.0;2100;68
" Call them , " Jon said , defiant . " You ca n't stop me from seeing him . ";Jon;Bran,Brothers,;0.0;2101;68
" Bran , " he said , " I 'm sorry I did n't come before . I was afraid . ";Bran;Jon,Stark,;-0.55;2113;69
Jon no longer cared . " Do n't die , Bran . Please . We 're all waiting for you to wake up . Me and Robb and the girls , everyone ... ";Jon;Stark,Bran,;0.0;2115;69
" I have to go now , " Jon said . " Uncle Benjen is waiting . I 'm to go north to the Wall . We have to leave today , before the snows come . ";Jon;Benjen,;0.0;2121;69
" I wanted him to stay here with me , " Lady Stark said softly .;Stark;Jon,Bran,;-0.2;2125;69
" I prayed for it , " she said dully . " He was my special boy . I went to the sept and prayed seven times to the seven faces of god that Ned would change his mind and leave him here with me . Sometimes prayers are answered . ";Bran;Ned,;0.357142857143;2129;69
Jon did not know what to say . " It was n't your fault , " he managed after an awkward silence .;Jon;Stark,Bran,;-0.6;2130;69
They were full of poison . " I need none of your absolution , bastard . ";Stark;Jon,Bran,;0.35;2132;69
Fingers like the bones of birds . " Good-bye , " he said .;Bran;Jon,Stark,;0.0;2136;69
He was at the door when she called out to him . " Jon , " she said .;Jon;Stark,Bran,;0.0;2137;69
" Yes ? ";Stark;Jon,Bran,;0.0;2140;69
" It should have been you , " she told him .;Bran;Jon,Stark,;0.0;2142;69
" Uncle Benjen is looking for you , " he told Jon . " He wanted to be gone an hour ago . ";Jon;Benjen,;0.0;2152;70
" I know , " Jon said . " Soon . ";Jon;Robb,finally,;0.0;2153;70
He looked around at all the noise and confusion . " Leaving is harder than I thought . ";finally;Jon,Robb,;-0.1;2154;70
" For me too , " Robb said .;Robb;Jon,finally,;0.0;2155;70
He had snow in his hair , melting from the heat of his body . " Did you see him ? ";Jon;Robb,finally,;0.0;2156;70
" He 's not going to die , " Robb said . " I know it . ";Robb;Jon,finally,;0.0;2158;70
" You Starks are hard to kill , " Jon agreed .;Jon;Stark,;-0.291666666667;2159;70
Robb knew something was wrong . " My mother ... ";Robb;Jon,finally,;-0.5;2162;70
" She was ... very kind , " Jon told him .;Jon;Robb,finally,;0.78;2163;70
Robb looked relieved . " Good . ";Robb;Jon,finally,;0.65;2164;70
He smiled . " The next time I see you , you 'll be all in black . ";finally;Jon,Robb,;0.144444444444;2165;70
Jon forced himself to smile back . " It was always my color . How long do you think it will be ? ";Jon;Robb,finally,;-0.0125;2166;70
" Soon enough , " Robb promised .;Robb;Jon,finally,;0.0;2167;70
He pulled Jon to him and embraced him fiercely . " Farewell , Snow . ";Jon;Robb,finally,;0.0;2168;70
Jon hugged him back . " And you , Stark . Take care of Bran . ";Jon;Robb,finally,;-0.1;2169;70
" I will . ";Robb;Jon,finally,;0.0;2170;70
They broke apart and looked at each other awkwardly . " Uncle Benjen said to send you to the stables if I saw you , " Robb finally said .;finally;Benjen,;-0.125;2171;70
" I have one more farewell to make , " Jon told him .;Jon;Robb,finally,;0.5;2172;70
" Then I have n't seen you , " Robb replied .;Robb;Jon,finally,;0.0;2173;70
She threw her skinny arms tight around his neck . " I was afraid you were gone , " she said , her breath catching in her throat . " They would n't let me out to say good-bye . ";Jon;Arya,;-0.0595238095238;2182;71
" What did you do now ? ";Jon;Arya,;0.0;2183;71
Arya disentangled herself from him and made a face . " Nothing . I was all packed and everything . ";Arya;Jon,;0.0;2185;71
She gestured at the huge chest , no more than a third full , and at the clothes that were scattered all over the room . " Septa Mordane says I have to do it all over . My things were n't properly folded , she says . A proper southron lady does n't just throw her clothes inside her chest like old rags , she says . ";Jon;Mordane,;0.225;2186;71
" Is that what you did , little sister ? ";Jon;Arya,;-0.1875;2187;71
" Well , they 're going to get all messed up anyway , " she said . " Who cares how they 're folded ? ";Jon;Arya,;0.0;2188;71
" Septa Mordane , " Jon told her . " I do n't think she'd like Nymeria helping , either . ";Jon;Nymeria,;0.0;2189;71
The she-wolf regarded him silently with her dark golden eyes . " It 's just as well . I have something for you to take with you , and it has to be packed very carefully . ";Jon;Arya,;0.116666666667;2190;71
Her face lit up . " A present ? ";Jon;Arya,;0.0;2191;71
" You could call it that . Close the door . ";Jon;Arya,;0.0;2192;71
Wary but excited , Arya checked the hall . " Nymeria , here . Guard . ";Arya;Jon,;-0.0625;2193;71
Dark eyes , like his . " A sword , " she said in a small , hushed breath .;Jon;Arya,;-0.2;2198;71
Jon drew out the blade slowly , so she could see the deep blue sheen of the steel . " This is no toy , " he told her . " Be careful you do n't cut yourself . The edges are sharp enough to shave with . ";Jon;Arya,;-0.045;2200;71
" Girls do n't shave , " Arya said .;Arya;Girls,;0.0;2201;71
" Maybe they should . Have you ever seen the septa 's legs ? ";Jon;Arya,;0.0;2202;71
She giggled at him . " It 's so skinny . ";Jon;Arya,;0.0;2203;71
" So are you , " Jon told her . " I had Mikken make this special . The bravos use swords like this in Pentos and Myr and the other Free Cities . It wo n't hack a man 's head off , but it can poke him full of holes if you 're fast enough . ";Jon;Mikken,;0.197023809524;2204;71
" I can be fast , " Arya said .;Arya;Jon,;0.2;2205;71
" You 'll have to work at it every day . ";Jon;Arya,;0.0;2206;71
He put the sword in her hands , showed her how to hold it , and stepped back . " How does it feel ? Do you like the balance ? ";Jon;Arya,;0.0;2207;71
" I think so , " Arya said .;Arya;Jon,;0.0;2208;71
" First lesson , " Jon said . " Stick them with the pointy end . ";Jon;Arya,;0.25;2209;71
The blow stung , but Jon found himself grinning like an idiot . " I know which end to use , " Arya said .;Jon;Arya,;0.0;2211;71
A doubtful look crossed her face . " Septa Mordane will take it away from me . ";Jon;Mordane,;-0.8;2212;71
" Not if she does n't know you have it , " Jon said .;Jon;Arya,;0.0;2213;71
" Who will I practice with ? ";Jon;Arya,;0.0;2214;71
" You 'll find someone , " Jon promised her . " King 's Landing is a true city , a thousand times the size of Winterfell . Until you find a partner , watch how they fight in the yard . Run , and ride , make yourself strong . And whatever you do ... ";Jon;Landing,;0.391666666667;2215;71
" ... do n't ... tell ... Sansa ! ";Jon;Arya,;0.0;2218;71
Jon messed up her hair . " I will miss you , little sister . ";Jon;Arya,;-0.1875;2219;71
Suddenly she looked like she was going to cry . " I wish you were coming with us . ";Jon;Arya,;0.0;2220;71
" Different roads sometimes lead to the same castle . Who knows ? ";Jon;Arya,;0.0;2221;71
He was not going to let himself be sad . " I better go . I 'll spend my first year on the Wall emptying chamber pots if I keep Uncle Ben waiting any longer . ";Jon;King,Benjen,;0.0833333333333;2223;71
Arya ran to him for a last hug . " Put down the sword first , " Jon warned her , laughing .;Jon;Arya,;0.0314814814815;2224;71
When he turned back at the door , she was holding it again , trying it for balance . " I almost forgot , " he told her . " All the best swords have names . ";Jon;Arya,;0.5;2226;71
" Like Ice , " she said .;Jon;Arya,;0.0;2227;71
She looked at the blade in her hand . " Does this have a name ? Oh , tell me . ";Jon;Arya,;0.0;2228;71
" Ca n't you guess ? ";Jon;Arya,;0.0;2229;71
Jon teased . " Your very favorite thing . ";Jon;Arya,;0.65;2230;71
" Needle ! ";Jon;Arya,;0.0;2235;71
" My fellow magisters have doubled the size of the city guard , " Illyrio told them over platters of honey duck and orange snap peppers one night at the manse that had been Drogo ' s. The khal had joined his khalasar , his estate given over to Daenerys and her brother until the wedding .;Illyrio;Jorah,Dany,Viserys,;0.0;2243;72
" Best we get Princess Daenerys wedded quickly before they hand half the wealth of Pentos away to sellswords and bravos , " Ser Jorah Mormont jested .;Jorah;Prince,;0.416666666667;2244;72
Magister Illyrio laughed lightly through his forked beard , but Viserys did not so much as smile . " He can have her tomorrow , if he likes , " her brother said .;Illyrio;Jorah,Dany,Viserys,;0.366666666667;2247;72
He glanced over at Dany , and she lowered her eyes . " So long as he pays the price . ";Dany;Illyrio,Jorah,Viserys,;-0.05;2248;72
Illyrio waved a languid hand in the air , rings glittering on his fat fingers . " I have told you , all is settled . Trust me . The khal has promised you a crown , and you shall have it . ";Illyrio;Jorah,Dany,Viserys,;0.0;2249;72
" Yes , but when ? ";Jorah;Illyrio,Dany,Viserys,;0.0;2250;72
" When the khal chooses , " Illyrio said . " He will have the girl first , and after they are wed he must make his procession across the plains and present her to the dosh khaleen at Vaes Dothrak . After that , perhaps . If the omens favor war . ";Illyrio;Jorah,Dany,Viserys,;0.125;2251;72
Viserys seethed with impatience . " I piss on Dothraki omens . The Usurper sits on my father 's throne . How long must I wait ? ";Viserys;Usurper,;-0.05;2252;72
Illyrio gave a massive shrug . " You have waited most of your life , great king . What is another few months , another few years ? ";Illyrio;Jorah,Dany,Viserys,;0.18;2253;72
Ser Jorah , who had traveled as far east as Vaes Dothrak , nodded in agreement . " I counsel you to be patient , Your Grace . The Dothraki are true to their word , but they do things in their own time . A lesser man may beg a favor from the khal , but must never presume to berate him . ";Jorah;Dothraki,;0.2625;2254;72
Viserys bristled . " Guard your tongue , Mormont , or I 'll have it out . I am no lesser man , I am the rightful Lord of the Seven Kingdoms . The dragon does not beg . ";Viserys;rightful,;0.0;2255;72
She stumbled and fell . " You woke the dragon , " he screamed as he kicked her . " You woke the dragon , you woke the dragon . ";Viserys;;0.0;2265;73
Illyrio had told her that might happen . " The Dothraki mate like the animals in their herds . There is no privacy in a khalasar , and they do not understand sin or shame as we do . ";Illyrio;;0.0;2304;74
Magister Illyrio had warned Dany about this too . " A Dothraki wedding without at least three deaths is deemed a dull affair , " he had said .;Illyrio;;-0.295833333333;2315;75
Irri and Jhiqui were copper-skinned Dothraki with black hair and almond-shaped eyes , Doreah a fair-haired , blue-eyed Lysene girl . " These are no common servants , sweet sister , " her brother told her as they were brought forward one by one . " Illyrio and I selected them personally for you . Irri will teach you riding , Jhiqui the Dothraki tongue , and Doreah will instruct you in the womanly arts of love . ";Irri;Irri,Doreah,;0.0766666666667;2330;76
He smiled thinly . " She 's very good , Illyrio and I can both swear to that . ";Irri;Jorah,;0.7225;2331;76
Ser Jorah Mormont apologized for his gift . " It is a small thing , my princess , but all a poor exile could afford , " he said as he laid a small stack of old books before her .;Jorah;Irri,;-0.2;2332;76
The last was black , as black as a midnight sea , yet alive with scarlet ripples and swirls . " What are they ? ";Drogo;Illyrio,Jorah,;-0.0583333333333;2344;77
" Dragon 's eggs , from the Shadow Lands beyond Asshai , " said Magister Illyrio . " The eons have turned them to stone , yet still they burn bright with beauty . ";Illyrio;Jorah,Drogo,;0.7;2346;77
" I shall treasure them always . ";Drogo;Illyrio,Jorah,;0.0;2347;77
Magister Illyrio and Ser Jorah had taught her the traditional refusals for these offerings . " This is a gift worthy of a great warrior , O blood of my blood , and I am but a woman . Let my lord husband bear these in my stead . ";Jorah;Illyrio,Drogo,;0.377777777778;2353;77
And so Khal Drogo too received his " bride gifts . ";Drogo;Illyrio,Jorah,;0.0;2354;77
Other gifts she was given in plenty by other Dothraki : slippers and jewels and silver rings for her hair , medallion belts and painted vests and soft furs , sandsilks and jars of scent , needles and feathers and tiny bottles of purple glass , and a gown made from the skin of a thousand mice . " A handsome gift , Khaleesi , " Magister Illyrio said of the last , after he had told her what it was . " Most lucky . ";Illyrio;Jorah,Drogo,;0.147916666667;2355;77
Khal Drogo said something in Dothraki and Magister Illyrio translated . " Silver for the silver of your hair , the khal says . ";Drogo;Dany,Illyrio,Jorah,;0.0;2365;78
" She 's beautiful , " Dany murmured .;Dany;Drogo,Illyrio,Jorah,;0.85;2366;78
" She is the pride of the khalasar , " Illyrio said . " Custom decrees that the khaleesi must ride a mount worthy of her place by the side of the khal . ";Illyrio;Drogo,Dany,Jorah,;0.333333333333;2367;78
No one had told her about this part . " What should I do ? ";Drogo;Dany,Illyrio,Jorah,;0.0;2371;78
It was Ser Jorah Mormont who answered . " Take the reins and ride . You need not go far . ";Jorah;Drogo,Dany,Illyrio,;0.1;2373;78
When she pulled up before Magister Illyrio , she said , " Tell Khal Drogo that he has given me the wind . ";Magister;Drogo,;0.0;2389;79
As the khal was saddling the horse , Viserys slid close to Dany on her silver , dug his fingers into her leg , and said , " Please him , sweet sister , or I swear , you will see the dragon wake as it has never woken before . ";khal;Magister,Drogo,Dany,;0.35;2394;79
The tiny silver bells in his long braid rang softly as he rode . " I am the blood of the dragon , " she whispered aloud as she followed , trying to keep her courage up . " I am the blood of the dragon . I am the blood of the dragon . ";Magister;khal,Drogo,Dany,;-0.025;2399;79
Khal Drogo stared at her tears , his face strangely empty of expression . " No , " he said .;Drogo;Magister,khal,Dany,;-0.1;2405;79
" You speak the Common Tongue , " Dany said in wonder .;Dany;Magister,khal,Drogo,;-0.3;2407;79
" No , " he said again .;Magister;khal,Drogo,Dany,;0.0;2408;79
Then he sat on the ground facing her , legs crossed beneath him , their faces finally at a height . " No , " he said .;Drogo;;0.0;2415;80
" Is that the only word you know ? ";Drogo;;0.0;2416;80
She averted her eyes and covered herself with her hands . " No , " Drogo said .;Drogo;;0.0;2434;81
He pulled her hands away from her breasts , gently but firmly , then lifted her face again to make her look at him . " No , " he repeated .;Drogo;;0.0;2435;81
" No , " she echoed back at him .;Drogo;;0.0;2436;81
He cupped her face in his huge hands and she looked into his eyes . " No ? ";Dany;;0.4;2455;82
She took his hand and moved it down to the wetness between her thighs . " Yes , " she whispered as she put his finger inside her .;Dany;;-0.155555555556;2457;82
Robert wore thick brown gloves and a heavy fur cloak with a hood that covered his ears , and looked for all the world like a bear sitting a horse . " Up , Stark ! ";Robert;Ned,;-0.291666666667;2463;83
he roared . " Up , up ! We have matters of state to discuss . ";Robert;Ned,;0.0;2464;83
" By all means , " Ned said . " Come inside , Your Grace . ";Ned;Robert,;0.0;2465;83
" No , no , no , " Robert said .;Robert;Ned,;0.0;2467;83
His breath steamed with every word . " The camp is full of ears . Besides , I want to ride out and taste this country of yours . ";Robert;Ned,;0.35;2468;83
Robert was flushed and exhilarated as Ned reined up beside him . " Gods , " he swore , laughing , " it feels good to get out and ride the way a man was meant to ride ! I swear , Ned , this creeping along is enough to drive a man mad . ";Robert;Ned,Lannister,;0.0625;2478;84
He had never been a patient man , Robert Baratheon . " That damnable wheelhouse , the way it creaks and groans , climbing every bump in the road as if it were a mountain ... I promise you , if that wretched thing breaks another axle , I 'm going to burn it , and Cersei can walk ! ";Robert;Cersei,;0.0;2479;84
Ned laughed . " I will gladly light the torch for you . ";Ned;Robert,Lannister,;0.55;2480;84
" Good man ! ";Robert;Ned,Lannister,;0.8125;2481;84
The king clapped him on the shoulder . " I 've half a mind to leave them all behind and just keep going . ";Lannister;Robert,Ned,;-0.283333333333;2482;84
A smile touched Ned 's lips . " I do believe you mean it . ";Ned;Robert,Lannister,;-0.00625;2483;84
" I do , I do , " the king said . " What do you say , Ned ? Just you and me , two vagabond knights on the kingsroad , our swords at our sides and the gods know what in front of us , and maybe a farmer 's daughter or a tavern wench to warm our beds tonight . ";Robert;Ned,Lannister,;0.6;2484;84
" Would that we could , " Ned said , " but we have duties now , my liege ... to the realm , to our children , I to my lady wife and you to your queen . We are not the boys we were . ";Ned;Robert,Lannister,;0.0;2485;84
" You were never the boy you were , " Robert grumbled . " More 's the pity . And yet there was that one time ... what was her name , that common girl of yours ? Becca ? No , she was one of mine , gods love her , black hair and these sweet big eyes , you could drown in them . Yours was ... Aleena ? No . You told me once . Was it Merryl ? You know the one I mean , your bastard 's mother ? ";Robert;Merryl,;0.0815476190476;2486;84
" Her name was Wylla , " Ned replied with cool courtesy , " and I would sooner not speak of her . ";Ned;Wyl,;0.35;2487;84
" Wylla . Yes . ";Robert;Ned,Lannister,;0.0;2488;84
The king grinned . " She must have been a rare wench if she could make Lord Eddard Stark forget his honor , even for an hour . You never told me what she looked like ... ";Lannister;Lord,;0.05;2489;84
Ned 's mouth tightened in anger . " Nor will I. Leave it be , Robert , for the love you say you bear me . I dishonored myself and I dishonored Catelyn , in the sight of gods and men . ";Ned;Catelyn,;-0.1;2490;84
" Gods have mercy , you scarcely knew Catelyn . ";Robert;Gods,Catelyn,;0.0;2491;84
" I had taken her to wife . She was carrying my child . ";Ned;Robert,Lannister,;0.0;2492;84
" You are too hard on yourself , Ned . You always were . Damn it , no woman wants Baelor the Blessed in her bed . ";Robert;Baelor,;-0.0458333333333;2493;84
He slapped a hand on his knee . " Well , I 'll not press you if you feel so strong about it , though I swear , at times you 're so prickly you ought to take the hedgehog as your sigil . ";Lannister;Robert,Ned,;0.433333333333;2494;84
Ned pointed them out to his king . " The barrows of the First Men . ";Ned;Robert,Lannister,;0.25;2497;84
Robert frowned . " Have we ridden onto a graveyard ? ";Robert;Ned,Lannister,;0.0;2498;84
" There are barrows everywhere in the north , Your Grace , " Ned told him . " This land is old . ";Ned;Robert,Lannister,;0.1;2499;84
" And cold , " Robert grumbled , pulling his cloak more tightly around himself .;Robert;Ned,Lannister,;-0.05;2500;84
The guard had reined up well behind them , at the bottom of the ridge . " Well , I did not bring you out here to talk of graves or bicker about your bastard . There was a rider in the night , from Lord Varys in King 's Landing . Here . ";Lannister;Robert,Ned,;-0.4;2501;84
Ned unrolled the paper with trepidation , thinking of Lysa and her terrible accusation , but the message did not concern Lady Arryn . " What is the source for this information ? ";Ned;Robert,Lannister,;-1.0;2505;84
" Do you remember Ser Jorah Mormont ? ";Robert;Jorah,;0.0;2506;84
" Would that I might forget him , " Ned said bluntly .;Ned;Robert,Lannister,;0.0;2507;84
" Ser Jorah is now in Pentos , anxious to earn a royal pardon that would allow him to return from exile , " Robert explained . " Lord Varys makes good use of him . ";Robert;Jorah,Lord,;0.2;2513;84
" So the slaver has become a spy , " Ned said with distaste .;Ned;Robert,Lannister,;0.0;2514;84
He handed the letter back . " I would rather he become a corpse . ";Lannister;Robert,Ned,;0.0;2515;84
" Varys tells me that spies are more useful than corpses , " Robert said . " Jorah aside , what do you make of his report ? ";Robert;Varys,;0.4;2516;84
" Daenerys Targaryen has wed some Dothraki horselord . What of it ? Shall we send her a wedding gift ? ";Lannister;Targaryen,;0.0;2517;84
The king frowned . " A knife , perhaps . A good sharp one , and a bold man to wield it . ";Ned;Robert,Lannister,;0.286111111111;2518;84
When he had protested that the young prince and princess were no more than babes , his new-made king had replied , " I see no babes . Only dragonspawn . ";Robert;Ned,Lannister,;0.2;2522;84
This time , Ned resolved to keep his temper . " Your Grace , the girl is scarcely more than a child . You are no Tywin Lannister , to slaughter innocents . ";Ned;Lannister,;0.5;2526;84
" And how long will this one remain an innocent ? ";Lannister;Robert,Ned,;0.225;2529;84
Robert 's mouth grew hard . " This child will soon enough spread her legs and start breeding more dragonspawn to plague me . ";Robert;Ned,Lannister,;0.0694444444444;2530;84
" Nonetheless , " Ned said , " the murder of children ... it would be vile ... unspeakable ... ";Ned;Robert,Lannister,;0.0;2531;84
" Unspeakable ? ";Robert;Ned,Lannister,;0.0;2532;84
the king roared . " What Aerys did to your brother Brandon was unspeakable . The way your lord father died , that was unspeakable . And Rhaegar ... how many times do you think he raped your sister ? How many hundreds of times ? ";Lannister;Aerys,;0.5;2533;84
The king jerked the reins hard , quieting the animal , and pointed an angry finger at Ned . " I will kill every Targaryen I can get my hands on , until they are as dead as their dragons , and then I will piss on their graves . ";Ned;Robert,Lannister,;-0.330555555556;2535;84
If the years had not quenched Robert 's thirst for revenge , no words of his would help . " You ca n't get your hands on this one , can you ? ";Robert;Ned,Lannister,;0.0;2537;84
The king 's mouth twisted in a bitter grimace . " No , gods be cursed . Some pox-ridden Pentoshi cheesemonger had her brother and her walled up on his estate with pointy-hatted eunuchs all around them , and now he 's handed them over to the Dothraki . I should have had them both killed years ago , when it was easy to get at them , but Jon was as bad as you . More fool I , I listened to him . ";Ned;Jon,;-0.0566666666667;2539;84
" Jon Arryn was a wise man and a good Hand . ";Robert;Jon,;0.675;2540;84
The anger was leaving him as suddenly as it had come . " This Khal Drogo is said to have a hundred thousand men in his horde . What would Jon say to that ? ";Lannister;Drogo,Jon,;-0.7;2542;84
" He would say that even a million Dothraki are no threat to the realm , so long as they remain on the other side of the narrow sea , " Ned replied calmly . " The barbarians have no ships . They hate and fear the open sea . ";Ned;Dothraki,;-0.235;2543;84
The king shifted uncomfortably in his saddle . " Perhaps . There are ships to be had in the Free Cities , though . I tell you , Ned , I do not like this marriage . There are still those in the Seven Kingdoms who call me Usurper . Do you forget how many houses fought for Targaryen in the war ? They bide their time for now , but give them half a chance , they will murder me in my bed , and my sons with me . If the beggar king crosses with a Dothraki horde at his back , the traitors will join him . ";Robert;Usurper,;0.183333333333;2544;84
" He will not cross , " Ned promised . " And if by some mischance he does , we will throw him back into the sea . Once you choose a new Warden of the East - ";Ned;Warden,;0.0454545454545;2545;84
The king groaned . " For the last time , I will not name the Arryn boy Warden . I know the boy is your nephew , but with Targaryens climbing in bed with Dothraki , I would be mad to rest one quarter of the realm on the shoulders of a sickly child . ";Robert;Targaryen,Arryn,;-0.3125;2546;84
Ned was ready for that . " Yet we still must have a Warden of the East . If Robert Arryn will not do , name one of your brothers . Stannis proved himself at the siege of Storm 's End , surely . ";Ned;Robert,Warden,;0.2;2547;84
" That is , " Ned finished quietly , watching , " unless you have already promised the honor to another . ";Ned;Robert,Lannister,;0.0;2551;84
Just as quickly , the look became annoyance . " What if I have ? ";Lannister;Robert,Ned,;0.0;2553;84
" It 's Jaime Lannister , is it not ? ";Robert;Lannister,;0.0;2554;84
The king rode on , eyes straight ahead . " Yes , " he said at last .;Lannister;Robert,Ned,;0.1;2557;84
" Kingslayer , " Ned said .;Ned;Robert,Lannister,;0.0;2559;84
He rode on dangerous ground now , he knew . " An able and courageous man , no doubt , " he said carefully , " but his father is Warden of the West , Robert . In time Ser Jaime will succeed to that honor . No one man should hold both East and West . ";Robert;Jaime,Warden,;-0.05;2561;84
" I will fight that battle when the enemy appears on the field , " the king said stubbornly . " At the moment , Lord Tywin looms eternal as Casterly Rock , so I doubt that Jaime will be succeeding anytime soon . Do n't vex me about this , Ned , the stone has been set . ";Lannister;Lord,Jaime,;0.0;2563;84
" Your Grace , may I speak frankly ? ";Ned;Robert,Lannister,;0.0;2564;84
" I seem unable to stop you , " Robert grumbled .;Robert;Ned,Lannister,;-0.5;2565;84
" Can you trust Jaime Lannister ? ";Ned;Lannister,;0.0;2567;84
" He is my wife 's twin , a Sworn Brother of the Kingsguard , his life and fortune and honor all bound to mine . ";Robert;Brothers,;0.0;2568;84
" As they were bound to Aerys Targaryen ' s , " Ned pointed out .;Ned;Robert,Lannister,;0.0;2569;84
" Why should I mistrust him ? He has done everything I have ever asked of him . His sword helped win the throne I sit on . ";Robert;Ned,Lannister,;0.8;2570;84
His sword helped taint the throne you sit on , Ned thought , but he did not permit the words to pass his lips . " He swore a vow to protect his king 's life with his own . Then he opened that king 's throat with a sword . ";Ned;Robert,Lannister,;0.6;2571;84
" Seven hells , someone had to kill Aerys ! ";Lannister;Aerys,;0.0;2572;84
Robert said , reining his mount to a sudden halt beside an ancient barrow . " If Jaime had n't done it , it would have been left for you or me . ";Robert;Jaime,;0.0;2573;84
" We were not Sworn Brothers of the Kingsguard , " Ned said .;Ned;Brothers,;0.0;2574;84
The time had come for Robert to hear the whole truth , he decided then and there . " Do you remember the Trident , Your Grace ? ";Robert;Trident,;0.2;2575;84
" I won my crown there . How should I forget it ? ";Lannister;Robert,Ned,;0.0;2576;84
" You took a wound from Rhaegar , " Ned reminded him . " So when the Targaryen host broke and ran , you gave the pursuit into my hands . The remnants of Rhaegar 's army fled back to King 's Landing . We followed . Aerys was in the Red Keep with several thousand loyalists . I expected to find the gates closed to us . ";Ned;Aerys,;-0.04;2577;84
Robert gave an impatient shake of his head . " Instead you found that our men had already taken the city . What of it ? ";Robert;Ned,Lannister,;-0.2;2578;84
" Not our men , " Ned said patiently . " Lannister men . The lion of Lannister flew over the ramparts , not the crowned stag . And they had taken the city by treachery . ";Ned;Lannister,;0.0;2579;84
" Treachery was a coin the Targaryens knew well , " Robert said .;Robert;Targaryen,;0.0;2586;85
The anger was building in him again . " Lannister paid them back in kind . It was no less than they deserved . I shall not trouble my sleep over it . ";Robert;Lannister,;-0.0666666666667;2587;85
" You were not there , " Ned said , bitterness in his voice .;Ned;Robert,;0.0;2588;85
He had lived his lies for fourteen years , yet they still haunted him at night . " There was no honor in that conquest . ";Robert;Ned,;0.0;2590;85
" The Others take your honor ! ";Robert;Ned,;0.0;2591;85
Robert swore . " What did any Targaryen ever know of honor ? Go down into your crypt and ask Lyanna about the dragon 's honor ! ";Robert;Targaryen,Lyanna,;-0.194444444444;2592;85
" You avenged Lyanna at the Trident , " Ned said , halting beside the king .;Ned;Lyanna,;0.0;2593;85
" That did not bring her back . ";Robert;Ned,;0.0;2595;85
Robert looked away , off into the grey distance . " The gods be damned . It was a hollow victory they gave me . A crown ... it was the girl I prayed them for . Your sister , safe ... and mine again , as she was meant to be . I ask you , Ned , what good is it to wear a crown ? The gods mock the prayers of kings and cowherds alike . ";Robert;Ned,;0.366666666667;2596;85
" I cannot answer for the gods , Your Grace ... only for what I found when I rode into the throne room that day , " Ned said . " Aerys was dead on the floor , drowned in his own blood . His dragon skulls stared down from the walls . Lannister 's men were everywhere . Jaime wore the white cloak of the Kingsguard over his golden armor . I can see him still . Even his sword was gilded . He was seated on the Iron Throne , high above his knights , wearing a helm fashioned in the shape of a lion 's head . How he glittered ! ";Ned;Aerys,Jaime,;0.102430555556;2597;85
" This is well known , " the king complained .;Robert;Ned,;-0.3;2598;85
" I was still mounted . I rode the length of the hall in silence , between the long rows of dragon skulls . It felt as though they were watching me , somehow . I stopped in front of the throne , looking up at him . His golden sword was across his legs , its edge red with a king 's blood . My men were filling the room behind me . Lannister 's men drew back . I never said a word . I looked at him seated there on the throne , and I waited . At last Jaime laughed and got up . He took off his helm , and he said to me , ' Have no fear , Stark . I was only keeping it warm for our friend Robert . It 's not a very comfortable seat , I 'm afraid . ' ";Robert;Jaime,;0.0725;2599;85
They took to the air in a wild beating of wings . " You think I should mistrust Lannister because he sat on my throne for a few moments ? ";Robert;Lannister,;-0.05;2602;85
He shook with laughter again . " Jaime was all of seventeen , Ned . Scarce more than a boy . ";Robert;Jaime,;0.5;2603;85
" Boy or man , he had no right to that throne . ";Robert;Ned,;0.285714285714;2604;85
" Perhaps he was tired , " Robert suggested . " Killing kings is weary work . Gods know , there 's no place else to rest your ass in that damnable room . And he spoke truly , it is a monstrous uncomfortable chair . In more ways than one . ";Robert;Gods,;-0.133333333333;2605;85
The king shook his head . " Well , now I know Jaime 's dark sin , and the matter can be forgotten . I am heartily sick of secrets and squabbles and matters of state , Ned . It 's all as tedious as counting coppers . Come , let 's ride , you used to know how . I want to feel the wind in my hair again . ";Robert;Jaime,;-0.454761904762;2606;85
With the mountains a wall to the west , the road veered north by northeast through the wood , a forest of oak and evergreen and black brier that seemed older and darker than any Tyrion had ever seen . " The wolfswood , " Benjen Stark called it , and indeed their nights came alive with the howls of distant packs , and some not so distant .;Tyrion;;-0.05;2633;86
With him were a pair of ragged peasant boys from the Fingers . " Rapers , " Yoren said with a cold look at his charges .;Yoren;;-0.6;2640;87
Benjen Stark seemed to share his brother 's distaste for Lannisters , and he had not been pleased when Tyrion had told him of his intentions . " I warn you , Lannister , you 'll find no inns at the Wall , " he had said , looking down on him .;Stark;Tyrion,;0.0481481481481;2654;88
" No doubt you 'll find some place to put me , " Tyrion had replied . " As you might have noticed , I 'm small . ";Tyrion;Stark,;-0.25;2655;88
One did not say no to the queen 's brother , of course , so that had settled the matter , but Stark had not been happy . " You will not like the ride , I promise you that , " he'd said curtly , and since the moment they set out , he had done all he could to live up to that promise .;Stark;Tyrion,;0.245454545455;2656;88
" Why do you read so much ? ";Tyrion;Jon,;0.1;2718;89
He closed the book on a finger and said , " Look at me and tell me what you see . ";Tyrion;Jon,;-0.1;2721;89
The boy looked at him suspiciously . " Is this some kind of trick ? I see you . Tyrion Lannister . ";Tyrion;Jon,;0.6;2722;89
Tyrion sighed . " You are remarkably polite for a bastard , Snow . What you see is a dwarf . You are what , twelve ? ";Tyrion;Jon,;0.0;2723;89
" Fourteen , " the boy said .;Tyrion;Jon,;0.0;2724;89
" Fourteen , and you 're taller than I will ever be . My legs are short and twisted , and I walk with difficulty . I require a special saddle to keep from falling off my horse . A saddle of my own design , you may be interested to know . It was either that or ride a pony . My arms are strong enough , but again , too short . I will never make a swordsman . Had I been born a peasant , they might have left me out to die , or sold me to some slaver 's grotesquerie . Alas , I was born a Lannister of Casterly Rock , and the grotesqueries are all the poorer . Things are expected of me . My father was the Hand of the King for twenty years . My brother later killed that very same king , as it turns out , but life is full of these little ironies . My sister married the new king and my repulsive nephew will be king after him . I must do my part for the honor of my House , would n't you agree ? Yet how ? Well , my legs may be too small for my body , but my head is too large , although I prefer to think it is just large enough for my mind . I have a realistic grasp of my own strengths and weaknesses . My mind is my weapon . My brother has his sword , King Robert has his warhammer , and I have my mind ... and a mind needs books as a sword needs a whetstone , if it is to keep its edge . ";Tyrion;King,Lannister,;0.0928077357425;2725;89
Tyrion tapped the leather cover of the book . " That 's why I read so much , Jon Snow . ";Tyrion;Jon,;0.1;2726;89
Whoever his mother had been , she had left little of herself in her son . " What are you reading about ? ";Tyrion;Jon,;-0.09375;2729;89
" Dragons , " Tyrion told him .;Tyrion;Jon,;0.0;2731;89
" What good is that ? There are no more dragons , " the boy said with the easy certainty of youth .;Tyrion;Jon,;0.527777777778;2732;89
" So they say , " Tyrion replied . " Sad , is n't it ? When I was your age , I used to dream of having a dragon of my own . ";Tyrion;Jon,;0.05;2733;89
" You did ? ";Tyrion;Jon,;0.0;2734;89
" Oh , yes . Even a stunted , twisted , ugly little boy can look down over the world when he 's seated on a dragon 's back . ";Tyrion;Jon,;-0.308611111111;2737;89
Tyrion pushed the bearskin aside and climbed to his feet . " I used to start fires in the bowels of Casterly Rock and stare at the flames for hours , pretending they were dragonfire . Sometimes I'd imagine my father burning . At other times , my sister . ";Tyrion;I'd,;-0.125;2738;89
Tyrion guffawed . " Do n't look at me that way , bastard . I know your secret . You 've dreamt the same kind of dreams . ";Tyrion;Jon,;0.0666666666667;2740;89
" No , " Jon Snow said , horrified . " I would n't ... ";Jon;Tyrion,;0.0;2741;89
" No ? Never ? ";Tyrion;Jon,;0.0;2742;89
Tyrion raised an eyebrow . " Well , no doubt the Starks have been terribly good to you . I 'm certain Lady Stark treats you as if you were one of her own . And your brother Robb , he 's always been kind , and why not ? He gets Winterfell and you get the Wall . And your father ... he must have good reasons for packing you off to the Night 's Watch ... ";Tyrion;Stark,King,;0.419047619048;2743;89
" Stop it , " Jon Snow said , his face dark with anger . " The Night 's Watch is a noble calling ! ";Jon;Tyrion,;-0.104166666667;2744;89
Tyrion laughed . " You 're too smart to believe that . The Night 's Watch is a midden heap for all the misfits of the realm . I 've seen you looking at Yoren and his boys . Those are your new brothers , Jon Snow , how do you like them ? Sullen peasants , debtors , poachers , rapers , thieves , and bastards like you all wind up on the Wall , watching for grumkins and snarks and all the other monsters your wet nurse warned you about . The good part is there are no grumkins or snarks , so it 's scarcely dangerous work . The bad part is you freeze your balls off , but since you 're not allowed to breed anyway , I do n't suppose that matters . ";Tyrion;Jon,;0.0323728354978;2745;89
" Stop it ! ";Tyrion;Jon,;0.0;2746;89
He ground his teeth in frustration , grabbed a root , and pulled himself back to a sitting position . " Help me , " he said to the boy , reaching up a hand .;Tyrion;Jon,;0.0;2755;90
Tyrion sagged back to the ground with a grunt . " Do n't help me , then . I 'll sit right here until you leave . ";Tyrion;Jon,;0.142857142857;2760;90
Jon Snow stroked Ghost 's thick white fur , smiling now . " Ask me nicely . ";Jon;Tyrion,;-0.15;2761;90
Perhaps he even deserved this . " I should be very grateful for your kind assistance , Jon , " he said mildly .;Tyrion;Jon,;0.4;2764;90
" Down , Ghost , " the boy said .;Tyrion;Jon,;-0.155555555556;2765;90
" Why did he attack me ? ";Tyrion;Jon,;0.0;2770;90
" Maybe he thought you were a grumkin . ";Tyrion;Jon,;0.0;2773;90
Then he laughed , a raw snort of amusement that came bursting out through his nose entirely without his permission . " Oh , gods , " he said , choking on his laughter and shaking his head , " I suppose I do rather look like a grumkin . What does he do to snarks ? ";Tyrion;Jon,;0.234615384615;2775;90
" You do n't want to know . ";Tyrion;Jon,;0.0;2776;90
He held out the skin to Jon Snow . " Want some ? ";Jon;Tyrion,;0.0;2780;90
The boy took the skin and tried a cautious swallow . " It 's true , is n't it ? ";Tyrion;Jon,;0.35;2781;90
he said when he was done . " What you said about the Night 's Watch . ";Tyrion;Jon,;0.0;2782;90
Jon Snow set his mouth in a grim line . " If that 's what it is , that 's what it is . ";Jon;Tyrion,;-1.0;2784;90
Tyrion grinned at him . " That 's good , bastard . Most men would rather deny a hard truth than face it . ";Tyrion;Jon,;0.286111111111;2785;90
" Most men , " the boy said . " But not you . ";Tyrion;Jon,;0.5;2786;90
" No , " Tyrion admitted , " not me . I seldom even dream of dragons anymore . There are no dragons . ";Tyrion;Jon,;0.0;2787;90
He scooped up the fallen bearskin . " Come , we had better return to camp before your uncle calls the banners . ";Tyrion;Jon,;0.5;2788;90
Tyrion tasted and handed it back . " More pepper , " he said .;Tyrion;Stark,;0.25;2799;91
Benjen Stark emerged from the shelter he shared with his nephew . " There you are . Jon , damn it , do n't go off like that by yourself . I thought the Others had gotten you . ";Stark;Tyrion,;-0.2;2800;91
" It was the grumkins , " Tyrion told him , laughing .;Tyrion;Stark,;0.0;2801;91
Ned and the girls were eight days gone when Maester Luwin came to her one night in Bran 's sickroom , carrying a reading lamp and the books of account . " It is past time that we reviewed the figures , my lady , " he said . " You 'll want to know how much this royal visit cost us . ";Maester;Bran,Catelyn,Robb,Stark,Ned,Fire,;-0.075;2815;92
She would have to cut it soon . " I have no need to look at figures , Maester Luwin , " she told him , never taking her eyes from Bran . " I know what the visit cost us . Take the books away . ";Bran;Maester,Catelyn,Robb,Stark,Ned,Fire,;0.0;2818;92
" My lady , the king 's party had healthy appetites . We must replenish our stores before - ";Robb;Maester,Bran,Catelyn,Stark,Ned,Fire,;0.5;2819;92
She cut him off . " I said , take the books away . The steward will attend to our needs . ";Catelyn;Maester,Bran,Robb,Stark,Ned,Fire,;0.0;2820;92
" We have no steward , " Maester Luwin reminded her .;Maester;Bran,Catelyn,Robb,Stark,Ned,Fire,;0.0;2821;92
Like a little grey rat , she thought , he would not let go . " Poole went south to establish Lord Eddard 's household at King 's Landing . ";Robb;Jeyne,;-0.11875;2822;92
Catelyn nodded absently . " Oh , yes . I remember . ";Catelyn;Maester,Bran,Robb,Stark,Ned,Fire,;0.0;2823;92
Maester Luwin set the lamp in a niche by the door and fiddled with its wick . " There are several appointments that require your immediate attention , my lady . Besides the steward , we need a captain of the guards to fill Jory 's place , a new master of horse - ";Maester;Jory,;0.0681818181818;2826;92
Her eyes snapped around and found him . " A master of horse ? ";Robb;Maester,Bran,Catelyn,Stark,Ned,Fire,;0.0;2827;92
The maester was shaken . " Yes , my lady . Hullen rode south with Lord Eddard , so - ";Maester;Hullen,;0.0;2829;92
" My son lies here broken and dying , Luwin , and you wish to discuss a new master of horse ? Do you think I care what happens in the stables ? Do you think it matters to me one whit ? I would gladly butcher every horse in Winterfell with my own hands if it would open Bran 's eyes , do you understand that ? Do you ! ";Robb;Maester,Bran,Catelyn,Stark,Ned,Fire,;0.130113636364;2830;92
He bowed his head . " Yes , my lady , but the appointments - ";Maester;Bran,Catelyn,Robb,Stark,Ned,Fire,;0.0;2831;92
" I 'll make the appointments , " Robb said .;Robb;Maester,Bran,Catelyn,Stark,Ned,Fire,;0.0;2832;92
Maester Luwin looked from Catelyn to her son . " I have prepared a list of those we might wish to consider for the vacant offices , " he said , offering Robb a paper plucked from his sleeve .;Maester;Bran,Catelyn,Robb,Stark,Ned,Fire,;0.0;2837;92
He had come from outside , Catelyn saw ; his cheeks were red from the cold , his hair shaggy and windblown . " Good men , " he said . " We 'll talk about them tomorrow . ";Catelyn;Maester,Bran,Robb,Stark,Ned,Fire,;0.0125;2839;92
" Very good , my lord . ";Maester;Bran,Catelyn,Robb,Stark,Ned,Fire,;0.845;2841;92
" Leave us now , " Robb said .;Robb;Maester,Bran,Catelyn,Stark,Ned,Fire,;0.0;2843;92
He was wearing a sword , she saw . " Mother , what are you doing ? ";Maester;Bran,Catelyn,Robb,Stark,Ned,Fire,;0.0;2846;92
Yet now for the first time she saw something of Eddard Stark in his face , something as stern and hard as the north . " What am I doing ? ";Stark;Maester,Bran,Catelyn,Robb,Ned,Fire,;-0.0805555555556;2848;92
she echoed , puzzled . " How can you ask that ? What do you imagine I 'm doing ? I am taking care of your brother . I am taking care of Bran . ";Robb;Maester,Bran,Catelyn,Stark,Ned,Fire,;0.0;2849;92
" Is that what you call it ? You have n't left this room since Bran was hurt . You did n't even come to the gate when Father and the girls went south . ";Maester;Bran,;0.0;2850;92
" I said my farewells to them here , and watched them ride out from that window . ";Ned;Maester,Bran,Catelyn,Robb,Stark,Fire,;0.0;2851;92
He had no choice , he had told her , and then he left , choosing . " I ca n't leave him , even for a moment , not when any moment could be his last . I have to be with him , if ... if ... ";Maester;Bran,Catelyn,Robb,Stark,Ned,Fire,;0.0;2854;92
Robb 's voice softened . " He 's not going to die , Mother . Maester Luwin says the time of greatest danger has passed . ";Robb;Maester,;1.0;2857;92
" And what if Maester Luwin is wrong ? What if Bran needs me and I 'm not here ? ";Maester;Maester,;-0.5;2858;92
" Rickon needs you , " Robb said sharply . " He 's only three , he does n't understand what 's happening . He thinks everyone has deserted him , so he follows me around all day , clutching my leg and crying . I do n't know what to do with him . ";Robb;Rickon,;-0.1;2859;92
He paused a moment , chewing on his lower lip the way he'd done when he was little . " Mother , I need you too . I 'm trying but I ca n't ... I ca n't do it all by myself . ";Maester;Bran,Catelyn,Robb,Stark,Ned,Fire,;-0.1875;2860;92
" Bran ' s. " Robb opened the window and let the night air into the stuffy tower room .;Robb;Maester,Bran,Catelyn,Stark,Ned,Fire,;0.0;2865;92
" Do n't , " she told him . " Bran needs to stay warm . ";Maester;Bran,;0.6;2868;92
" He needs to hear them sing , " Robb said .;Robb;Maester,Bran,Catelyn,Stark,Ned,Fire,;0.0;2869;92
Then a third , closer . " Shaggydog and Grey Wind , " Robb said as their voices rose and fell together . " You can tell them apart if you listen close . ";Robb;Maester,Bran,Catelyn,Stark,Ned,Fire,;0.183333333333;2871;92
Sobbing , she pulled her hand free of his and covered her ears against those terrible howls . " Make them stop ! ";Maester;Bran,Catelyn,Robb,Stark,Ned,Fire,;-0.375;2875;92
she cried . " I ca n't stand it , make them stop , make them stop , kill them all if you must , just make them stop ! ";Catelyn;Maester,Bran,Robb,Stark,Ned,Fire,;0.0;2876;92
She did n't remember falling to the floor , but there she was , and Robb was lifting her , holding her in strong arms . " Do n't be afraid , Mother . They would never hurt him . ";Robb;Maester,Bran,Catelyn,Stark,Ned,Fire,;-0.0833333333333;2877;92
He helped her to her narrow bed in the corner of the sickroom . " Close your eyes , " he said gently . " Rest . Maester Luwin tells me you 've hardly slept since Bran 's fall . ";Maester;Maester,;-0.2;2878;92
" I ca n't , " she wept . " Gods forgive me , Robb , I ca n't , what if he dies while I 'm asleep , what if he dies , what if he dies ... ";Robb;Gods,;0.0;2879;92
She screamed and held her ears again . " Oh , gods , close the window ! ";Maester;Bran,Catelyn,Robb,Stark,Ned,Fire,;0.0;2881;92
" If you swear to me you 'll sleep . ";Catelyn;Maester,Bran,Robb,Stark,Ned,Fire,;0.0;2882;92
Robb went to the window , but as he reached for the shutters another sound was added to the mournful howling of the direwolves . " Dogs , " he said , listening . " All the dogs are barking . They 've never done that before ... ";Robb;Maester,Bran,Catelyn,Stark,Ned,Fire,;0.4;2883;92
When she looked up , his face was pale in the lamplight . " Fire , " he whispered .;Maester;Bran,Catelyn,Robb,Stark,Ned,Fire,;0.0;2885;92
Fire , she thought , and then , Bran ! " Help me , " she said urgently , sitting up . " Help me with Bran . ";Fire;Maester,Bran,Catelyn,Robb,Stark,Ned,;0.0;2886;92
Robb did not seem to hear her . " The library tower 's on fire , " he said .;Robb;Maester,Bran,Catelyn,Stark,Ned,Fire,;0.0;2887;92
The library was across the bailey , there was no way the fire would reach them here . " Thank the gods , " she whispered .;Maester;Bran,Catelyn,Robb,Stark,Ned,Fire,;0.0;2891;92
Robb looked at her as if she'd gone mad . " Mother , stay here . I 'll come back as soon as the fire 's out . ";Robb;Maester,Bran,Catelyn,Stark,Ned,Fire,;-0.3125;2892;92
Outside , there were shouts of " Fire ! ";Maester;Bran,Catelyn,Robb,Stark,Ned,Fire,;0.0;2895;92
" You were n't s'posed to be here , " he muttered sourly . " No one was s'posed to be here . ";Catelyn;;0.0;2904;93
Catelyn looked at the knife , then at Bran . " No , " she said .;Catelyn;;0.0;2908;93
He must have heard her . " It 's a mercy , " he said . " He 's dead already . ";Catelyn;;-0.2;2910;93
" No , " Catelyn said , louder now as she found her voice again . " No , you ca n't . ";Catelyn;;0.0;2911;93
The dagger was still clutched tightly in his right hand , slick with blood . " You were n't s'posed to be here , " he repeated stupidly .;Catelyn;;0.0178571428571;2925;94
Of course it was . " Thank you , " Catelyn whispered , her voice faint and tiny .;Catelyn;;-0.25;2935;95
" Bring me some bread and honey , " she told her servants , " and take word to Maester Luwin that my bandages want changing . ";Catelyn;;0.0;2951;96
" Who was he ? ";Catelyn;Mollen,Hal,Greyjoy,Robb,Maester,Rodrik,Theon,;0.0;2961;97
" No one knows his name , " Hallis Mollen told her . " He was no man of Winterfell , m'lady , but some says they seen him here and about the castle these past few weeks . ";Mollen;Hal,Greyjoy,Robb,Catelyn,Maester,Rodrik,Theon,;-0.225;2963;97
" One of the king 's men , then , " she said , " or one of the Lannisters ' . He could have waited behind when the others left . ";Catelyn;Mollen,Hal,Greyjoy,Robb,Maester,Rodrik,Theon,;-0.2;2964;97
" Maybe , " Hal said . " With all these strangers filling up Winterfell of late , there 's no way of saying who he belonged to . ";Hal;Mollen,Greyjoy,Robb,Catelyn,Maester,Rodrik,Theon,;-0.3;2965;97
" He'd been hiding in your stables , " Greyjoy said . " You could smell it on him . ";Greyjoy;He'd,;0.0;2966;97
" And how could he go unnoticed ? ";Catelyn;Mollen,Hal,Greyjoy,Robb,Maester,Rodrik,Theon,;-0.2;2967;97
Hallis Mollen looked abashed . " Between the horses Lord Eddard took south and them we sent north to the Night 's Watch , the stalls were half-empty . It were no great trick to hide from the stableboys . Could be Hodor saw him , the talk is that boy 's been acting queer , but simple as he is ... ";Mollen;Eddard,Hodor,;0.266666666667;2969;97
" We found where he'd been sleeping , " Robb put in . " He had ninety silver stags in a leather bag buried beneath the straw . ";Robb;Mollen,Hal,Greyjoy,Catelyn,Maester,Rodrik,Theon,;0.0;2971;97
" It 's good to know my son 's life was not sold cheaply , " Catelyn said bitterly .;Catelyn;Mollen,Hal,Greyjoy,Robb,Maester,Rodrik,Theon,;0.65;2972;97
Hallis Mollen looked at her , confused . " Begging your grace , m'lady , you saying he was out to kill your boy ? ";Mollen;Hal,Greyjoy,Robb,Catelyn,Maester,Rodrik,Theon,;-0.4;2973;97
Greyjoy was doubtful . " That 's madness . ";Greyjoy;Mollen,Hal,Robb,Catelyn,Maester,Rodrik,Theon,;-0.8;2974;97
" He came for Bran , " Catelyn said . " He kept muttering how I was n't supposed to be there . He set the library fire thinking I would rush to put it out , taking any guards with me . If I had n't been half-mad with grief , it would have worked . ";Catelyn;Mollen,Hal,Greyjoy,Robb,Maester,Rodrik,Theon,;-0.8;2975;97
" Why would anyone want to kill Bran ? ";Rodrik;Bran,;0.0;2976;97
Robb said . " Gods , he 's only a little boy , helpless , sleeping ... ";Robb;Mollen,Hal,Greyjoy,Catelyn,Maester,Rodrik,Theon,;-0.09375;2977;97
Catelyn gave her firstborn a challenging look . " If you are to rule in the north , you must think these things through , Robb . Answer your own question . Why would anyone want to kill a sleeping child ? ";Catelyn;Mollen,Hal,Greyjoy,Robb,Maester,Rodrik,Theon,;0.55;2978;97
" How is my son , Maester ? ";Robb;Mollen,Hal,Greyjoy,Catelyn,Maester,Rodrik,Theon,;0.0;2982;97
Maester Luwin lowered his eyes . " Unchanged , my lady . ";Maester;Mollen,Hal,Greyjoy,Robb,Catelyn,Rodrik,Theon,;0.0;2984;97
She sent the servants away and looked back to Robb . " Do you have the answer yet ? ";Robb;Mollen,Hal,Greyjoy,Catelyn,Maester,Rodrik,Theon,;0.0;2987;97
" Someone is afraid Bran might wake up , " Robb said , " afraid of what he might say or do , afraid of something he knows . ";Robb;Bran,;-0.6;2988;97
Catelyn was proud of him . " Very good . ";Catelyn;Mollen,Hal,Greyjoy,Robb,Maester,Rodrik,Theon,;0.8225;2989;97
She turned to the new captain of the guard . " We must keep Bran safe . If there was one killer , there could be others . ";Robb;Bran,;0.318181818182;2990;97
" How many guards do you want , m'lady ? ";Hal;Mollen,Greyjoy,Robb,Catelyn,Maester,Rodrik,Theon,;0.5;2991;97
" So long as Lord Eddard is away , my son is the master of Winterfell , " she told him .;Catelyn;Lord,;-0.05;2993;97
Robb stood a little taller . " Put one man in the sickroom , night and day , one outside the door , two at the bottom of the stairs . No one sees Bran without my warrant or my mother ' s. ";Robb;Bran,;-0.09375;2994;97
" As you say , m'lord . ";Rodrik;Mollen,Hal,Greyjoy,Robb,Catelyn,Maester,Theon,;0.0;2995;97
" Do it now , " Catelyn suggested .;Catelyn;Mollen,Hal,Greyjoy,Robb,Maester,Rodrik,Theon,;0.0;2996;97
" And let his wolf stay in the room with him , " Robb added .;Robb;Mollen,Hal,Greyjoy,Catelyn,Maester,Rodrik,Theon,;0.0;2997;97
" Yes , " Catelyn said .;Catelyn;Mollen,Hal,Greyjoy,Robb,Maester,Rodrik,Theon,;0.0;2998;97
And then again : " Yes . ";Robb;Mollen,Hal,Greyjoy,Catelyn,Maester,Rodrik,Theon,;0.0;2999;97
" Lady Stark , " Ser Rodrik said when the guardsman had gone , " did you chance to notice the dagger the killer used ? ";Rodrik;Mollen,Hal,Greyjoy,Robb,Catelyn,Maester,Theon,;-0.2;3001;97
" The circumstances did not allow me to examine it closely , but I can vouch for its edge , " Catelyn replied with a dry smile . " Why do you ask ? ";Catelyn;Mollen,Hal,Greyjoy,Robb,Maester,Rodrik,Theon,;0.116666666667;3002;97
" We found the knife still in the villain 's grasp . It seemed to me that it was altogether too fine a weapon for such a man , so I looked at it long and hard . The blade is Valyrian steel , the hilt dragonbone . A weapon like that has no business being in the hands of such as him . Someone gave it to him . ";Robb;Mollen,Hal,Greyjoy,Catelyn,Maester,Rodrik,Theon,;0.015;3003;97
Catelyn nodded , thoughtful . " Robb , close the door . ";Catelyn;Mollen,Hal,Greyjoy,Robb,Maester,Rodrik,Theon,;0.4;3004;97
" What I am about to tell you must not leave this room , " she told them . " I want your oaths on that . If even part of what I suspect is true , Ned and my girls have ridden into deadly danger , and a word in the wrong ears could mean their lives . ";Robb;Mollen,Hal,Greyjoy,Catelyn,Maester,Rodrik,Theon,;-0.323958333333;3006;97
" Lord Eddard is a second father to me , " said Theon Greyjoy . " I do so swear . ";Greyjoy;Lord,;0.0;3007;97
" You have my oath , " Maester Luwin said .;Maester;Mollen,Hal,Greyjoy,Robb,Catelyn,Rodrik,Theon,;0.0;3008;97
" And mine , my lady , " echoed Ser Rodrik .;Rodrik;Mollen,Hal,Greyjoy,Robb,Catelyn,Maester,Theon,;0.0;3009;97
She looked at her son . " And you , Robb ? ";Robb;Mollen,Hal,Greyjoy,Catelyn,Maester,Rodrik,Theon,;0.0;3010;97
" My sister Lysa believes the Lannisters murdered her husband , Lord Arryn , the Hand of the King , " Catelyn told them . " It comes to me that Jaime Lannister did not join the hunt the day Bran fell . He remained here in the castle . ";Catelyn;Lysa,Lannister,;0.0;3012;97
The room was deathly quiet . " I do not think Bran fell from that tower , " she said into the stillness . " I think he was thrown . ";Robb;Bran,;0.0;3013;97
The shock was plain on their faces . " My lady , that is a monstrous suggestion , " said Rodrik Cassel . " Even the Kingslayer would flinch at the murder of an innocent child . ";Rodrik;King,;0.142857142857;3014;97
" Oh , would he ? ";Catelyn;Mollen,Hal,Greyjoy,Robb,Maester,Rodrik,Theon,;0.0;3015;97
Theon Greyjoy asked . " I wonder . ";Greyjoy;Mollen,Hal,Robb,Catelyn,Maester,Rodrik,Theon,;0.0;3016;97
" There is no limit to Lannister pride or Lannister ambition , " Catelyn said .;Catelyn;Mollen,Hal,Greyjoy,Robb,Maester,Rodrik,Theon,;0.0;3017;97
" The boy had always been surehanded in the past , " Maester Luwin said thoughtfully . " He knew every stone in Winterfell . ";Maester;Mollen,Hal,Greyjoy,Robb,Catelyn,Rodrik,Theon,;-0.25;3018;97
" Gods , " Robb swore , his young face dark with anger . " If this is true , he will pay for it . ";Robb;Mollen,Hal,Greyjoy,Catelyn,Maester,Rodrik,Theon,;-0.1;3019;97
He drew his sword and waved it in the air . " I 'll kill him myself ! ";Catelyn;Mollen,Hal,Greyjoy,Robb,Maester,Rodrik,Theon,;0.0;3020;97
Ser Rodrik bristled at him . " Put that away ! The Lannisters are a hundred leagues away . Never draw your sword unless you mean to use it . How many times must I tell you , foolish boy ? ";Rodrik;Lannister,;0.09375;3021;97
Catelyn said to Ser Rodrik , " I see my son is wearing steel now . ";Catelyn;Mollen,Hal,Greyjoy,Robb,Maester,Rodrik,Theon,;0.0;3023;97
The old master-at-arms said , " I thought it was time . ";Rodrik;Mollen,Hal,Greyjoy,Robb,Catelyn,Maester,Theon,;0.1;3024;97
Robb was looking at her anxiously . " Past time , " she said . " Winterfell may have need of all its swords soon , and they had best not be made of wood . ";Robb;Winterfell,;0.375;3025;97
Theon Greyjoy put a hand on the hilt of his blade and said , " My lady , if it comes to that , my House owes yours a great debt . ";Greyjoy;House,;0.8;3026;97
Maester Luwin pulled at his chain collar where it chafed against his neck . " All we have is conjecture . This is the queen 's beloved brother we mean to accuse . She will not take it kindly . We must have proof , or forever keep silent . ";Maester;Mollen,Hal,Greyjoy,Robb,Catelyn,Rodrik,Theon,;0.129166666667;3027;97
" Your proof is in the dagger , " Ser Rodrik said . " A fine blade like that will not have gone unnoticed . ";Rodrik;Mollen,Hal,Greyjoy,Robb,Catelyn,Maester,Theon,;0.108333333333;3028;97
There was only one place to find the truth of it , Catelyn realized . " Someone must go to King 's Landing . ";Catelyn;Mollen,Hal,Greyjoy,Robb,Maester,Rodrik,Theon,;0.0;3029;97
" I 'll go , " Robb said .;Robb;Mollen,Hal,Greyjoy,Catelyn,Maester,Rodrik,Theon,;0.0;3030;97
" No , " she told him . " Your place is here . There must always be a Stark in Winterfell . ";Catelyn;Stark,;-0.2;3031;97
She climbed out of bed . " I must go myself . ";Robb;Mollen,Hal,Greyjoy,Catelyn,Maester,Rodrik,Theon,;0.0;3037;97
" My lady , " said Maester Luwin , " is that wise ? Surely the Lannisters would greet your arrival with suspicion . ";Maester;Lannister,;0.7;3038;97
" What about Bran ? ";Catelyn;Mollen,Hal,Greyjoy,Robb,Maester,Rodrik,Theon,;0.0;3039;97
The poor boy looked utterly confused now . " You ca n't mean to leave him . ";Robb;Mollen,Hal,Greyjoy,Catelyn,Maester,Rodrik,Theon,;-0.370833333333;3041;97
" I have done everything I can for Bran , " she said , laying a wounded hand on his arm . " His life is in the hands of the gods and Maester Luwin . As you reminded me yourself , Robb , I have other children to think of now . ";Catelyn;Mollen,Hal,Greyjoy,Robb,Maester,Rodrik,Theon,;-0.125;3042;97
" You will need a strong escort , my lady , " Theon said .;Theon;Mollen,Hal,Greyjoy,Robb,Catelyn,Maester,Rodrik,;0.433333333333;3043;97
" I 'll send Hal with a squad of guardsmen , " Robb said .;Robb;Hal,;0.0;3044;97
" No , " Catelyn said . " A large party attracts unwelcome attention . I would not have the Lannisters know I am coming . ";Catelyn;Mollen,Hal,Greyjoy,Robb,Maester,Rodrik,Theon,;0.214285714286;3045;97
Ser Rodrik protested . " My lady , let me accompany you at least . The kingsroad can be perilous for a woman alone . ";Rodrik;Mollen,Hal,Greyjoy,Robb,Catelyn,Maester,Theon,;-0.3;3046;97
" I will not be taking the kingsroad , " Catelyn replied .;Catelyn;Mollen,Hal,Greyjoy,Robb,Maester,Rodrik,Theon,;0.0;3047;97
She thought for a moment , then nodded her consent . " Two riders can move as fast as one , and a good deal faster than a long column burdened by wagons and wheel-houses . I will welcome your company , Ser Rodrik . We will follow the White Knife down to the sea , and hire a ship at White Harbor . Strong horses and brisk winds should bring us to King 's Landing well ahead of Ned and the Lannisters . ";Robb;White,;0.234722222222;3048;97
Eddard Stark had left before dawn , Septa Mordane informed Sansa as they broke their fast . " The king sent for him . Another hunt , I do believe . There are still wild aurochs in these lands , I am told . ";Stark;Sansa,Mordane,;0.025;3053;98
" I 've never seen an aurochs , " Sansa said , feeding a piece of bacon to Lady under the table .;Sansa;Stark,Mordane,;0.0;3054;98
Septa Mordane sniffed in disapproval . " A noble lady does not feed dogs at her table , " she said , breaking off another piece of comb and letting the honey drip down onto her bread .;Mordane;Stark,Sansa,;0.222222222222;3056;98
" She 's not a dog , she 's a direwolf , " Sansa pointed out as Lady licked her fingers with a rough tongue . " Anyway , Father said we could keep them with us if we want . ";Sansa;Father,;-0.1;3057;98
The septa was not appeased . " You 're a good girl , Sansa , but I do vow , when it comes to that creature you 're as willful as your sister Arya . ";Mordane;Stark,Sansa,;0.65;3058;98
She scowled . " And where is Arya this morning ? ";Stark;Sansa,Mordane,;0.0;3059;98
" She was n't hungry , " Sansa said , knowing full well that her sister had probably stolen down to the kitchen hours ago and wheedled a breakfast out of some cook 's boy .;Sansa;Stark,Mordane,;0.0972222222222;3060;98
" Do remind her to dress nicely today . The grey velvet , perhaps . We are all invited to ride with the queen and Princess Myrcella in the royal wheelhouse , and we must look our best . ";Mordane;Stark,Sansa,;0.475;3061;98
You never knew what she would do . " I 'll tell her , " Sansa said uncertainly , " but she 'll dress the way she always does . ";Sansa;Mordane,;0.0;3073;99
She hoped it would n't be too embarrassing . " May I be excused ? ";Sansa;Mordane,;0.0;3074;99
" You may . ";Mordane;Sansa,;0.0;3075;99
" You better put on something pretty , " Sansa told her . " Septa Mordane said so . We 're traveling in the queen 's wheelhouse with Princess Myrcella today . ";Sansa;Mordane,;0.375;3083;100
" I 'm not , " Arya said , trying to brush a tangle out of Nymeria 's matted grey fur . " Mycah and I are going to ride upstream and look for rubies at the ford . ";Arya;Sansa,;-0.05;3084;100
" Rubies , " Sansa said , lost . " What rubies ? ";Sansa;Arya,;0.0;3085;100
Arya gave her a look like she was so stupid . " Rhaegar 's rubies . This is where King Robert killed him and won the crown . ";Arya;King,;-0.8;3086;100
Sansa regarded her scrawny little sister in disbelief . " You ca n't look for rubies , the princess is expecting us . The queen invited us both . ";Sansa;Arya,;-0.1875;3087;100
" I do n't care , " Arya said . " The wheelhouse does n't even have windows , you ca n't see a thing . ";Arya;Sansa,;0.0;3088;100
" What could you want to see ? ";Sansa;Arya,;0.0;3089;100
She had been thrilled by the invitation , and her stupid sister was going to ruin everything , just as she'd feared . " It 's all just fields and farms and holdfasts . ";Sansa;Arya,;-0.1;3091;100
" It is not , " Arya said stubbornly . " If you came with us sometimes , you'd see . ";Arya;Sansa,;0.0;3092;100
" I hate riding , " Sansa said fervently . " All it does is get you soiled and dusty and sore . ";Sansa;Arya,;-0.6;3093;100
Arya shrugged . " Hold still , " she snapped at Nymeria , " I 'm not hurting you . ";Arya;Sansa,;0.0;3094;100
Then to Sansa she said , " When we were crossing the Neck , I counted thirty-six flowers I never saw before , and Mycah showed me a lizard-lion . ";Sansa;Mycah,;0.0;3095;100
Arya was still going on , brushing out Nymeria 's tangles and chattering about things she'd seen on the trek south . " Last week we found this haunted watchtower , and the day before we chased a herd of wild horses . You should have seen them run when they caught a scent of Nymeria . ";Arya;Sansa,Nymeria,;0.05;3109;101
The wolf wriggled in her grasp and Arya scolded her . " Stop that , I have to do the other side , you 're all muddy . ";Arya;Sansa,Nymeria,;-0.125;3110;101
" You 're not supposed to leave the column , " Sansa reminded her . " Father said so . ";Sansa;Father,;0.0;3111;101
Arya shrugged . " I did n't go far . Anyway , Nymeria was with me the whole time . I do n't always go off , either . Sometimes it 's fun just to ride along with the wagons and talk to people . ";Arya;Nymeria,;0.2;3112;101
Sansa was running out of patience now . " You have to come with me , " she told her sister firmly . " You ca n't refuse the queen . Septa Mordane will expect you . ";Sansa;Mordane,;0.0;3117;101
Nymeria growled and spun away , affronted . " Come back here ! ";Nymeria;Arya,Sansa,;0.0;3120;101
" There 's going to be lemon cakes and tea , " Sansa went on , all adult and reasonable .;Sansa;Arya,Nymeria,;0.15;3121;101
Sansa scratched her ears the way she liked , and Lady sat beside her on her haunches , watching Arya chase Nymeria . " Why would you want to ride a smelly old horse and get all sore and sweaty when you could recline on feather pillows and eat cakes with the queen ? ";Sansa;Arya,Nymeria,;0.35;3123;101
" I do n't like the queen , " Arya said casually .;Arya;Sansa,Nymeria,;0.0;3124;101
Sansa sucked in her breath , shocked that even Arya would say such a thing , but her sister prattled on , heedless . " She wo n't even let me bring Nymeria . ";Sansa;Nymeria,;-0.35;3125;101
" A royal wheelhouse is no place for a wolf , " Sansa said . " And Princess Myrcella is afraid of them , you know that . ";Sansa;Prince,;-0.6;3128;101
" Myrcella is a little baby . ";Nymeria;Myrcella,;-0.1875;3129;101
Frustrated , Arya threw down the brush . " Bad wolf ! ";Arya;Sansa,Nymeria,;-0.613425925926;3131;101
Arya heard and whirled around , glaring . " I do n't care what you say , I 'm going out riding . ";Arya;Sansa,;0.0;3138;102
" Gods be true , Arya , sometimes you act like such a child , " Sansa said . " I 'll go by myself then . It will be ever so much nicer that way . Lady and I will eat all the lemon cakes and just have the best time without you . ";Sansa;Gods,;0.3625;3140;102
She turned to walk off , but Arya shouted after her , " They wo n't let you bring Lady either . ";Arya;Lady,;0.0;3141;102
She heard her saying , " The council does us great honor , my good lords . ";Sansa;;0.725;3161;103
" What 's happening ? ";Sansa;;0.0;3162;103
" The council sent riders from King 's Landing to escort us the rest of the way , " he told her . " An honor guard for the king . ";Sansa;;0.0;3164;103
" The king is gone hunting , but I know he will be pleased to see you when he returns , " the queen was saying to the two knights who knelt before her , but Sansa could not take her eyes off the third man .;Sansa;moment,Joffrey,Clegane,Stark,finally,Serrett,Lady,Lord,;0.25;3180;104
Strong hands grasped her by the shoulders , and for a moment Sansa thought it was her father , but when she turned , it was the burned face of Sandor Clegane looking down at her , his mouth twisted in a terrible mockery of a smile . " You are shaking , girl , " he said , his voice rasping . " Do I frighten you so much ? ";moment;Sansa,Joffrey,Clegane,Stark,finally,Serrett,Lady,Lord,;-0.137037037037;3186;104
" A wolf , " a man said , and someone else said , " Seven hells , that 's a direwolf , " and the first man said , " What 's it doing in camp ? ";Joffrey;Sansa,moment,Clegane,Stark,finally,Serrett,Lady,Lord,;0.25;3191;104
and the Hound 's rasping voice replied , " The Starks use them for wet nurses , " and Sansa realized that the two stranger knights were looking down on her and Lady , swords in their hands , and then she was frightened again , and ashamed .;Sansa;moment,Joffrey,Clegane,Stark,finally,Serrett,Lady,Lord,;-0.127777777778;3192;104
She heard the queen say , " Joffrey , go to her . ";Serrett;Sansa,moment,Joffrey,Clegane,Stark,finally,Lady,Lord,;0.0;3194;104
" Leave her alone , " Joffrey said .;Joffrey;Sansa,moment,Clegane,Stark,finally,Serrett,Lady,Lord,;0.0;3196;104
He gave her his hand , drew her to her feet . " What is it , sweet lady ? Why are you afraid ? No one will hurt you . Put away your swords , all of you . The wolf is her little pet , that 's all . ";Sansa;moment,Joffrey,Clegane,Stark,finally,Serrett,Lady,Lord,;-0.145833333333;3198;104
He looked at Sandor Clegane . " And you , dog , away with you , you 're scaring my betrothed . ";Clegane;Sansa,moment,Joffrey,Stark,finally,Serrett,Lady,Lord,;0.0;3199;104
She was a Stark of Winterfell , a noble lady , and someday she would be a queen . " It was not him , my sweet prince , " she tried to explain . " It was the other one . ";Stark;Sansa,moment,Joffrey,Clegane,finally,Serrett,Lady,Lord,;0.15625;3203;104
The two stranger knights exchanged a look . " Payne ? ";Joffrey;Sansa,moment,Clegane,Stark,finally,Serrett,Lady,Lord,;0.0;3204;104
The older man in white spoke to Sansa gently . " Ofttimes Ser Ilyn frightens me as well , sweet lady . He has a fearsome aspect . ";Sansa;Serrett,;0.172222222222;3206;104
" As well he should . ";Joffrey;Sansa,moment,Clegane,Stark,finally,Serrett,Lady,Lord,;0.0;3207;104
The spectators parted to make way for her . " If the wicked do not fear the King 's Justice , you have put the wrong man in the office . ";Sansa;King,;-0.5;3209;104
Sansa finally found her words . " Then surely you have chosen the right one , Your Grace , " she said , and a gale of laughter erupted all around her .;finally;Sansa,moment,Joffrey,Clegane,Stark,Serrett,Lady,Lord,;0.285714285714;3210;104
" Well spoken , child , " said the old man in white . " As befits the daughter of Eddard Stark . I am honored to know you , however irregular the manner of our meeting . I am Ser Barristan Selmy , of the Kingsguard . ";Joffrey;Serrett,;-0.0333333333333;3211;104
Sansa knew the name , and now the courtesies that Septa Mordane had taught her over the years came back to her . " The Lord Commander of the Kingsguard , " she said , " and councillor to Robert our king and to Aerys Targaryen before him . The honor is mine , good knight . Even in the far north , the singers praise the deeds of Barristan the Bold . ";Sansa;moment,Joffrey,Clegane,Stark,finally,Serrett,Lady,Lord,;0.270833333333;3213;104
The green knight laughed again . " Barristan the Old , you mean . Do n't flatter him too sweetly , child , he thinks overmuch of himself already . ";Joffrey;Sansa,moment,Clegane,Stark,finally,Serrett,Lady,Lord,;0.071875;3214;104
He smiled at her . " Now , wolf girl , if you can put a name to me as well , then I must concede that you are truly our Hand 's daughter . ";Sansa;moment,Joffrey,Clegane,Stark,finally,Serrett,Lady,Lord,;0.6;3215;104
Joffrey stiffened beside her . " Have a care how you address my betrothed . ";Joffrey;Sansa,moment,Clegane,Stark,finally,Serrett,Lady,Lord,;0.0;3216;104
" I can answer , " Sansa said quickly , to quell her prince 's anger .;Sansa;moment,Joffrey,Clegane,Stark,finally,Serrett,Lady,Lord,;-0.7;3217;104
She smiled at the green knight . " Your helmet bears golden antlers , my lord . The stag is the sigil of the royal House . King Robert has two brothers . By your extreme youth , you can only be Renly Baratheon , Lord of Storm 's End and councillor to the king , and so I name you . ";Joffrey;King,Renly,;0.115;3218;104
Ser Barristan chuckled . " By his extreme youth , he can only be a prancing jackanapes , and so I name him . ";Serrett;Sansa,moment,Joffrey,Clegane,Stark,finally,Lady,Lord,;-0.0625;3219;104
Lady bared her teeth and began to growl , a low rumble full of menace , but this time Sansa silenced the wolf with a gentle hand to the head . " I am sorry if I offended you , Ser Ilyn , " she said .;Lady;Sansa,moment,Joffrey,Clegane,Stark,finally,Serrett,Lord,;0.0125;3224;104
She looked at her prince . " Did I say something wrong , Your Grace ? Why will he not speak to me ? ";Sansa;moment,Joffrey,Clegane,Stark,finally,Serrett,Lady,Lord,;-0.5;3229;104
" Ser Ilyn has not been feeling talkative these past fourteen years , " Lord Renly commented with a sly smile .;Lord;Serrett,;0.025;3230;104
Joffrey gave his uncle a look of pure loathing , then took Sansa 's hands in his own . " Aerys Targaryen had his tongue ripped out with hot pincers . ";Joffrey;Targaryen,;0.354761904762;3231;104
" He speaks most eloquently with his sword , however , " the queen said , " and his devotion to our realm is unquestioned . ";Sansa;moment,Joffrey,Clegane,Stark,finally,Serrett,Lady,Lord,;0.5;3232;104
Then she smiled graciously and said , " Sansa , the good councillors and I must speak together until the king returns with your father . I fear we shall have to postpone your day with Myrcella . Please give your sweet sister my apologies . Joffrey , perhaps you would be so kind as to entertain our guest today . ";Serrett;Sansa,moment,Joffrey,Clegane,Stark,finally,Lady,Lord,;0.55;3233;104
" It would be my pleasure , Mother , " Joffrey said very formally .;Joffrey;Sansa,moment,Clegane,Stark,finally,Serrett,Lady,Lord,;0.2;3234;104
The touch of Joffrey 's hand on her sleeve made her heart beat faster . " What would you like to do ? ";Joffrey;Sansa,moment,Clegane,Stark,finally,Serrett,Lady,Lord,;0.0;3240;104
Be with you , Sansa thought , but she said , " Whatever you'd like to do , my prince . ";Sansa;moment,Joffrey,Clegane,Stark,finally,Serrett,Lady,Lord,;0.0;3241;104
Joffrey reflected a moment . " We could go riding . ";Joffrey;Sansa,moment,Clegane,Stark,finally,Serrett,Lady,Lord,;0.0;3242;104
" Oh , I love riding , " Sansa said .;Sansa;moment,Joffrey,Clegane,Stark,finally,Serrett,Lady,Lord,;0.5;3243;104
Joffrey glanced back at Lady , who was following at their heels . " Your wolf is liable to frighten the horses , and my dog seems to frighten you . Let us leave them both behind and set off on our own , what do you say ? ";Joffrey;Sansa,moment,Clegane,Stark,finally,Serrett,Lady,Lord,;0.02;3244;104
Sansa hesitated . " If you like , " she said uncertainly . " I suppose I could tie Lady up . ";Sansa;Lady,;0.0;3245;104
She did not quite understand , though . " I did n't know you had a dog ... ";Serrett;Sansa,moment,Joffrey,Clegane,Stark,finally,Lady,Lord,;0.0;3246;104
Joffrey laughed . " He 's my mother 's dog , in truth . She has set him to guard me , and so he does . ";Joffrey;Sansa,moment,Clegane,Stark,finally,Serrett,Lady,Lord,;0.7;3247;104
" You mean the Hound , " she said .;Sansa;Hound,;-0.3125;3248;104
Her prince would never love her if she seemed stupid . " Is it safe to leave him behind ? ";Serrett;Sansa,moment,Joffrey,Clegane,Stark,finally,Lady,Lord,;-0.05;3250;104
Prince Joffrey looked annoyed that she would even ask . " Have no fear , lady . I am almost a man grown , and I do n't fight with wood like your brothers . All I need is this . ";Joffrey;Sansa,moment,Clegane,Stark,finally,Serrett,Lady,Lord,;-0.4;3251;104
Sansa exclaimed over it admiringly , and Joffrey looked pleased . " I call it Lion 's Tooth , " he said .;Sansa;Lion,;0.5;3253;104
They dined on trout fresh from the river , and Sansa drank more wine than she had ever drunk before . " My father only lets us have one cup , and only at feasts , " she confessed to her prince .;Sansa;Joffrey,;0.06;3260;105
" My betrothed can drink as much as she wants , " Joffrey said , refilling her cup .;Joffrey;Sansa,;0.15;3261;105
Sansa was a little dizzy from the wine . " Should n't we be starting back ? ";Sansa;Joffrey,;-0.0625;3264;105
" Soon , " Joffrey said . " The battleground is right up ahead , where the river bends . That was where my father killed Rhaegar Targaryen , you know . He smashed in his chest , crunch , right through the armor . ";Joffrey;Targaryen,;0.285714285714;3266;105
Joffrey swung an imaginary warhammer to show her how it was done . " Then my uncle Jaime killed old Aerys , and my father was king . What 's that sound ? ";Joffrey;Jaime,Aerys,;0.25;3267;105
Sansa heard it too , floating through the woods , a kind of wooden clattering , snack snack snack . " I do n't know , " she said .;Sansa;Joffrey,;0.3;3268;105
It made her nervous , though . " Joffrey , let 's go back . ";Sansa;Joffrey,;0.0;3269;105
" I want to see what it is . ";Sansa;Joffrey,;0.0;3270;105
" Someone 's there , " Sansa said anxiously .;Sansa;Joffrey,;0.0;3273;105
" You 're safe with me . ";Sansa;Joffrey,;0.5;3275;105
The sound of steel on leather made her tremble . " This way , " he said , riding through a stand of trees .;Joffrey;Sansa,;0.4;3277;105
The girl glared at them , sucking on her knuckles to take the sting out , and Sansa was horrified . " Arya ? ";Sansa;Arya,Joffrey,Mycah,;0.0;3286;106
" Go away , " Arya shouted back at them , angry tears in her eyes . " What are you doing here ? Leave us alone . ";Arya;Sansa,Joffrey,Mycah,;-0.25;3288;106
Joffrey glanced from Arya to Sansa and back again . " Your sister ? ";Joffrey;Sansa,Arya,Mycah,;0.0;3289;106
Joffrey examined the boy , an ungainly lad with a coarse , freckled face and thick red hair . " And who are you , boy ? ";Joffrey;Sansa,Arya,Mycah,;-0.1;3291;106
" Mycah , " the boy muttered .;Sansa;Arya,Joffrey,Mycah,;0.0;3293;106
He recognized the prince and averted his eyes . " M'lord . ";Joffrey;Sansa,Arya,Mycah,;0.0;3294;106
" He 's the butcher 's boy , " Sansa said .;Sansa;Arya,Joffrey,Mycah,;0.0;3295;106
" He 's my friend , " Arya said sharply . " You leave him alone . ";Arya;Sansa,Joffrey,Mycah,;0.0;3296;106
" A butcher 's boy who wants to be a knight , is it ? ";Sansa;Arya,Joffrey,Mycah,;0.2;3297;106
Joffrey swung down from his mount , sword in hand . " Pick up your sword , butcher 's boy , " he said , his eyes bright with amusement . " Let us see how good you are . ";Joffrey;Sansa,Arya,Mycah,;0.398148148148;3298;106
Joffrey walked toward him . " Go on , pick it up . Or do you only fight little girls ? ";Joffrey;Sansa,Arya,Mycah,;-0.09375;3300;106
" She ast me to , m'lord , " Mycah said . " She ast me to . ";Mycah;Sansa,Arya,Joffrey,;0.0;3301;106
The wine had made him wild . " Are you going to pick up your sword ? ";Joffrey;Sansa,Arya,Mycah,;0.1;3303;106
Mycah shook his head . " It 's only a stick , m'lord . It 's not no sword , it 's only a stick . ";Mycah;Sansa,Arya,Joffrey,;0.0;3304;106
" And you 're only a butcher 's boy , and no knight . ";Sansa;Arya,Joffrey,Mycah,;0.0;3305;106
Joffrey lifted Lion 's Tooth and laid its point on Mycah 's cheek below the eye , as the butcher 's boy stood trembling . " That was my lady 's sister you were hitting , do you know that ? ";Joffrey;Sansa,Arya,Mycah,;0.0;3306;106
" Stop it ! ";Arya;Sansa,Joffrey,Mycah,;0.0;3308;106
Sansa was afraid . " Arya , you stay out of this . ";Sansa;Arya,Joffrey,Mycah,;-0.6;3311;106
" I wo n't hurt him ... much , " Prince Joffrey told Arya , never taking his eyes off the butcher 's boy .;Joffrey;Sansa,Arya,Mycah,;0.1;3312;106
Sansa was shrieking , " No , no , stop it , stop it , both of you , you 're spoiling it , " but no one was listening .;Sansa;Mycah,;0.0;3321;107
She hit his horse instead , and the blood bay reared and went galloping off after Mycah . " Stop it , do n't , stop it ! ";Mycah;Sansa,;0.0;3323;107
The steel fell from his fingers as the wolf knocked him off his feet , and they rolled in the grass , the wolf snarling and ripping at him , the prince shrieking in pain . " Get it off , " he screamed . " Get it off ! ";Arya;Joffrey,;0.0;3330;108
Arya 's voice cracked like a whip . " Nymeria ! ";Arya;Joffrey,;0.0;3331;108
Arya said , " She did n't hurt you ... much . ";Arya;Joffrey,;0.1;3335;108

" You leave him alone ! ";Arya;Joffrey,;0.0;3338;108

His eyes snapped open and looked at her , and there was nothing but loathing there , nothing but the vilest contempt . " Then go , " he spit at her . " And do n't touch me . ";Sansa;;0.0;3349;109
" They 've found her , my lord . ";Jeyne;Ned,Arya,;0.0;3353;110
Ned rose quickly . " Our men or Lannister ' s ? ";Ned;Jeyne,Arya,;0.6;3354;110

His men had been searching for Arya for four days now , but the queen 's men had been out hunting as well . " Where is she ? Tell Jory to bring her here at once . ";Arya;Jory,;0.0;3357;110
" I am sorry , my lord , " Poole told him . " The guards on the gate were Lannister men , and they informed the queen when Jory brought her in . She 's being taken directly before the king ... ";Jeyne;Jory,;-0.5;3358;110

Ned said , striding to the door . " Find Sansa and bring her to the audience chamber . Her voice may be needed . ";Ned;Sansa,;0.0;3360;110

" No . ";Robert;Arya,Ned,Clegane,Joffrey,Lord,Sansa,Lannister,Jory,finally,Serrett,Hound,;0.0;3387;111

He rose to face the king . " What is the meaning of this ? ";Robert;Arya,Ned,Clegane,Joffrey,Lord,Sansa,Lannister,Jory,finally,Serrett,Hound,;0.6;3390;111
Their only good fortune was that both Jaime Lannister and Sandor Clegane were missing , leading searches north of the Trident . " Why was I not told that my daughter had been found ? ";Clegane;Arya,Ned,Robert,Joffrey,Lord,Sansa,Lannister,Jory,finally,Serrett,Hound,;0.15;3395;111
Ned demanded , his voice ringing . " Why was she not brought to me at once ? ";Ned;Arya,Clegane,Robert,Joffrey,Lord,Sansa,Lannister,Jory,finally,Serrett,Hound,;0.0;3396;111
He spoke to Robert , but it was Cersei Lannister who answered . " How dare you speak to your king in that manner ! ";Robert;Arya,Ned,Clegane,Joffrey,Lord,Sansa,Lannister,Jory,finally,Serrett,Hound,;0.0;3397;111
At that , the king stirred . " Quiet , woman , " he snapped .;Ned;Arya,Clegane,Robert,Joffrey,Lord,Sansa,Lannister,Jory,finally,Serrett,Hound,;0.0;3398;111
He straightened in his seat . " I am sorry , Ned . I never meant to frighten the girl . It seemed best to bring her here and get the business done with quickly . ";Robert;Arya,Ned,Clegane,Joffrey,Lord,Sansa,Lannister,Jory,finally,Serrett,Hound,;0.25;3399;111
" And what business is that ? ";Ned;Arya,Clegane,Robert,Joffrey,Lord,Sansa,Lannister,Jory,finally,Serrett,Hound,;0.0;3400;111
The queen stepped forward . " You know full well , Stark . This girl of yours attacked my son . Her and her butcher 's boy . That animal of hers tried to tear his arm off . ";Robert;Arya,Ned,Clegane,Joffrey,Lord,Sansa,Lannister,Jory,finally,Serrett,Hound,;0.075;3402;111
" That 's not true , " Arya said loudly . " She just bit him a little . He was hurting Mycah . ";Arya;Mycah,;0.08125;3403;111
" Joff told us what happened , " the queen said . " You and the butcher boy beat him with clubs while you set your wolf on him . ";Ned;Joffrey,;0.0;3404;111
" That 's not how it was , " Arya said , close to tears again .;Arya;Ned,Clegane,Robert,Joffrey,Lord,Sansa,Lannister,Jory,finally,Serrett,Hound,;0.0;3405;111
" Yes it is ! ";Ned;Arya,Clegane,Robert,Joffrey,Lord,Sansa,Lannister,Jory,finally,Serrett,Hound,;0.0;3407;111

When his son was done talking , the king rose heavily from his seat , looking like a man who wanted to be anywhere but here . " What in all the seven hells am I supposed to make of this ? He says one thing , she says another . ";Robert;Arya,Ned,Clegane,Joffrey,Lord,Sansa,Lannister,Jory,finally,Serrett,Hound,;0.6;3428;111

She blinked at her sister , then at the young prince . " I do n't know , " she said tearfully , looking as though she wanted to bolt . " I do n't remember . Everything happened so fast , I did n't see ... ";Ned;Arya,Clegane,Robert,Joffrey,Lord,Sansa,Lannister,Jory,finally,Serrett,Hound,;0.15;3435;111

The queen was furious . " Joff will carry those scars for the rest of his life . ";Ned;Joffrey,;0.0;3446;111
Robert Baratheon looked at his eldest son . " So he will . Perhaps they will teach him a lesson . Ned , see that your daughter is disciplined . I will do the same with my son . ";Robert;Arya,Ned,Clegane,Joffrey,Lord,Sansa,Lannister,Jory,finally,Serrett,Hound,;0.0;3447;111

Her eyes were frightened as they went to her father . " He does n't mean Lady , does he ? ";finally;Lady,;-0.3125;3465;111
She saw the truth on his face . " No , " she said . " No , not Lady , Lady did n't bite anybody , she 's good ... ";Ned;Lady,;0.65;3466;111

Ser Rodrik chose that moment to appear on deck . " My good friend , " said Moreo through his forked green beard .;Rodrik;Tyrosh,Catelyn,Moreo,;0.225;3677;123
The Tyroshi loved bright colors , even in their facial hair . " It is so fine to see you looking better . ";Tyrosh;Rodrik,Catelyn,Moreo,;0.463333333333;3678;123
" Yes , " Ser Rodrik agreed . " I have n't wanted to die for almost two days now . ";Rodrik;Tyrosh,Catelyn,Moreo,;0.0;3679;123
He bowed to Catelyn . " My lady . ";Catelyn;Rodrik,Tyrosh,Moreo,;0.0;3680;123
" The captain was just telling me that our voyage is almost at an end , " she said .;Moreo;Rodrik,Tyrosh,Catelyn,;0.0;3684;123
Ser Rodrik managed a wry smile . " So soon ? ";Rodrik;Tyrosh,Catelyn,Moreo,;0.3;3685;123
" I will leave you to discuss your business , " Captain Moreo said .;Moreo;Rodrik,Tyrosh,Catelyn,;0.0;3688;123
Ser Rodrik held the rail and looked out over the passing shore . " I have not been the most valiant of protectors . ";Rodrik;Tyrosh,Catelyn,Moreo,;0.5;3691;123
Catelyn touched his arm . " We are here , Ser Rodrik , and safely . That is all that truly matters . ";Catelyn;Rodrik,Tyrosh,Moreo,;0.0;3692;123
She found she had to touch it now and then , to reassure herself . " Now we must reach the king 's master-at-arms , and pray that he can be trusted . ";Moreo;Rodrik,Tyrosh,Catelyn,;0.0;3695;123
" Ser Aron Santagar is a vain man , but an honest one . ";Rodrik;Aron,;0.6;3696;123
He looked nonplussed . " He may know the blade , yes ... but , my lady , the moment we go ashore we are at risk . And there are those at court who will know you on sight . ";Moreo;Rodrik,Tyrosh,Catelyn,;0.0;3698;123
Catelyn 's mouth grew tight . " Littlefinger , " she murmured .;Catelyn;Rodrik,Tyrosh,Moreo,;-0.178571428571;3699;123
Ser Rodrik cleared his throat . " Lord Baelish once , ah ... ";Rodrik;Tyrosh,Catelyn,Moreo,;0.0;3704;123
Catelyn was past delicacy . " He was my father 's ward . We grew up together in Riverrun . I thought of him as a brother , but his feelings for me were ... more than brotherly . When it was announced that I was to wed Brandon Stark , Petyr challenged for the right to my hand . It was madness . Brandon was twenty , Petyr scarcely fifteen . I had to beg Brandon to spare Petyr 's life . He let him off with a scar . Afterward my father sent him away . I have not seen him since . ";Catelyn;Petyr,Bran,;0.0839285714286;3706;123
She lifted her face to the spray , as if the brisk wind could blow the memories away . " He wrote to me at Riverrun after Brandon was killed , but I burned the letter unread . By then I knew that Ned would marry me in his brother 's place . ";Moreo;Bran,Ned,Riverrun,;0.1;3707;123
Ser Rodrik 's fingers fumbled once again for nonexistent whiskers . " Littlefinger sits on the small council now . ";Rodrik;Littlefinger,;-0.25;3708;123
" I knew he would rise high , " Catelyn said . " He was always clever , even as a boy , but it is one thing to be clever and another to be wise . I wonder what the years have done to him . ";Catelyn;Rodrik,Tyrosh,Moreo,;0.298333333333;3709;123
" My lady , " Ser Rodrik said , " I have thought on how best to proceed while I lay abed . You must not enter the castle . I will go in your stead and bring Ser Aron to you in some safe place . ";Rodrik;Aron,;0.75;3733;124
Moreo was shouting in the vulgar Valyrian of the Free Cities . " You would be as much at risk as I would . ";Moreo;Rodrik,;0.25;3735;124
Ser Rodrik smiled . " I think not . I looked at my reflection in the water earlier and scarcely recognized myself . My mother was the last person to see me without whiskers , and she is forty years dead . I believe I am safe enough , my lady . ";Rodrik;Moreo,;0.15;3736;124
Moreo came bustling up , all smiles . " King 's Landing , my lady , as you did command , and never has a ship made a swifter or surer passage . Will you be needing assistance to carry your things to the castle ? ";Moreo;Tyrosh,Catelyn,Rodrik,;0.0;3743;125
" We shall not be going to the castle . Perhaps you can suggest an inn , someplace clean and comfortable and not too far from the river . ";Rodrik;Moreo,Tyrosh,Catelyn,;0.288888888889;3744;125
The Tyroshi fingered his forked green beard . " Just so . I know of several establishments that might suit your needs . Yet first , if I may be so bold , there is the matter of the second half of the payment we agreed upon . And of course the extra silver you were so kind as to promise . Sixty stags , I believe it was . ";Tyrosh;Moreo,Catelyn,Rodrik,;0.102083333333;3745;125
" For the oarmen , " Catelyn reminded him .;Catelyn;Moreo,Tyrosh,Rodrik,;0.0;3746;125
" Oh , of a certainty , " said Moreo . " Though perhaps I should hold it for them until we return to Tyrosh . For the sake of their wives and children . If you give them the silver here , my lady , they will dice it away or spend it all for a night 's pleasure . ";Moreo;Tyrosh,Catelyn,Rodrik,;0.0;3747;125
" There are worse things to spend money on , " Ser Rodrik put in . " Winter is coming . ";Rodrik;Winterfell,;-0.4;3748;125
" A man must make his own choices , " Catelyn said . " They earned the silver . How they spend it is no concern of mine . ";Catelyn;Moreo,Tyrosh,Rodrik,;0.6;3749;125
" As you say , my lady , " Moreo replied , bowing and smiling .;Moreo;Tyrosh,Catelyn,Rodrik,;0.0;3750;125
" I think it best if you stay away from the common room , " Ser Rodrik said , after they had settled in . " Even in a place like this , one never knows who may be watching . ";Rodrik;Moreo,Tyrosh,Catelyn,;0.35;3756;125
He wore ringmail , dagger , and longsword under a dark cloak with a hood he could pull up over his head . " I will be back before nightfall , with Ser Aron , " he promised . " Rest now , my lady . ";Moreo;Tyrosh,Catelyn,Rodrik,;-0.075;3757;125
A fist hammered at her door again , and a voice called out , " Open , in the name of the king . ";King;Catelyn,Rodrik,;0.0;3767;126
" A moment , " she called out .;Catelyn;King,Rodrik,;0.0;3768;126
Their leader smiled at the dagger in her hand and said , " No need for that , m'lady . We 're to escort you to the castle . ";King;Catelyn,Rodrik,;0.6;3773;126
" By whose authority ? ";Catelyn;King,Rodrik,;0.0;3774;126
The seal was a mockingbird , in grey wax . " Petyr , " she said .;King;Catelyn,Rodrik,;-0.05;3778;126
She looked at the head guardsman . " Do you know who I am ? ";Rodrik;King,Catelyn,;0.0;3781;126
" No , m'lady , " he said . " M'lord Littlefinger said only to bring you to him , and see that you were not mistreated . ";King;Littlefinger,;0.0;3782;126
Catelyn nodded . " You may wait outside while I dress . ";Catelyn;King,Rodrik,;0.0;3783;126
When they ushered her inside , he set down his pen and looked at her . " Cat , " he said quietly .;Catelyn;;-0.155555555556;3800;127
" Why have I been brought here in this fashion ? ";Catelyn;;0.0;3801;127
He rose and gestured brusquely to the guards . " Leave us . ";Catelyn;;0.6;3802;127
The men departed . " You were not mistreated , I trust , " he said after they had gone . " I gave firm instructions . ";Catelyn;;-0.2;3803;127
He noticed her bandages . " Your hands ... ";Catelyn;;0.0;3804;127
Catelyn ignored the implied question . " I am not accustomed to being summoned like a serving wench , " she said icily . " As a boy , you still knew the meaning of courtesy . ";Catelyn;;0.0;3805;127
" I 've angered you , my lady . That was never my intent . ";Catelyn;;-0.75;3806;127
" How did you know I was in the city ? ";Littlefinger;Petyr,Catelyn,Varys,Lord,;0.0;3815;128
" Lord Varys knows all , " Petyr said with a sly smile . " He will be joining us shortly , but I wanted to see you alone first . It has been too long , Cat . How many years ? ";Petyr;Lord,;0.25;3817;128
There were more important questions . " So it was the King 's Spider who found me . ";Varys;King,;0.45;3819;128
Littlefinger winced . " You do n't want to call him that . He 's very sensitive . Comes of being an eunuch , I imagine . Nothing happens in this city without Varys knowing . Ofttimes he knows about it before it happens . He has informants everywhere . His little birds , he calls them . One of his little birds heard about your visit . Thankfully , Varys came to me first . ";Littlefinger;Varys,;0.00125;3820;128
" Why you ? ";Varys;Petyr,Littlefinger,Catelyn,Lord,;0.0;3821;128
He shrugged . " Why not me ? I am master of coin , the king 's own councillor . Selmy and Lord Renly rode north to meet Robert , and Lord Stannis is gone to Dragonstone , leaving only Maester Pycelle and me . I was the obvious choice . I was ever a friend to your sister Lysa , Varys knows that . ";Littlefinger;Lord,Varys,Robert,;0.2;3822;128
" Does Varys know about ... ";Varys;Varys,;0.0;3823;128
" Lord Varys knows everything ... except why you are here . ";Littlefinger;Lord,;0.0;3824;128
He lifted an eyebrow . " Why are you here ? ";Varys;Petyr,Littlefinger,Catelyn,Lord,;0.0;3825;128
" A wife is allowed to yearn for her husband , and if a mother needs her daughters close , who can tell her no ? ";Catelyn;Petyr,Littlefinger,Varys,Lord,;0.0;3826;128
Littlefinger laughed . " Oh , very good , my lady , but please do n't expect me to believe that . I know you too well . What were the Tully words again ? ";Littlefinger;Petyr,Catelyn,Varys,Lord,;0.7725;3827;128
Her throat was dry . " Family , Duty , Honor , " she recited stiffly .;Varys;Petyr,Littlefinger,Catelyn,Lord,;-0.0666666666667;3828;128
" Family , Duty , Honor , " he echoed . " All of which required you to remain in Winterfell , where our Hand left you . No , my lady , something has happened . This sudden trip of yours bespeaks a certain urgency . I beg of you , let me help . Old sweet friends should never hesitate to rely upon each other . ";Catelyn;Petyr,Littlefinger,Varys,Lord,;0.089880952381;3830;128
There was a soft knock on the door . " Enter , " Littlefinger called out .;Littlefinger;Petyr,Catelyn,Varys,Lord,;0.1;3831;128
He wore a vest of woven gold thread over a loose gown of purple silk , and on his feet were pointed slippers of soft velvet . " Lady Stark , " he said , taking her hand in both of his , " to see you again after so many years is such a joy . ";Varys;Petyr,Littlefinger,Catelyn,Lord,;0.187179487179;3833;128
His flesh was soft and moist , and his breath smelled of lilacs . " Oh , your poor hands . Have you burned yourself , sweet lady ? The fingers are so delicate ... Our good Maester Pycelle makes a marvelous salve , shall I send for a jar ? ";Littlefinger;Maester,;0.233333333333;3834;128
Catelyn slid her fingers from his grasp . " I thank you , my lord , but my own Maester Luwin has already seen to my hurts . ";Catelyn;Luwin,;0.6;3835;128
Varys bobbed his head . " I was grievous sad to hear about your son . And him so young . The gods are cruel . ";Varys;Petyr,Littlefinger,Catelyn,Lord,;-0.55;3836;128
" On that we agree , Lord Varys , " she said .;Littlefinger;Petyr,Catelyn,Varys,Lord,;0.0;3837;128
The eunuch spread his soft hands . " On more than that , I hope , sweet lady . I have great esteem for your husband , our new Hand , and I know we do both love King Robert . ";Varys;Robert,;0.397727272727;3839;128
" Yes , " she was forced to say . " For a certainty . ";Catelyn;Petyr,Littlefinger,Varys,Lord,;-0.3;3840;128
" Never has a king been so beloved as our Robert , " quipped Littlefinger .;Littlefinger;Petyr,Catelyn,Varys,Lord,;0.7;3841;128
He smiled slyly . " At least in Lord Varys 's hearing . ";Catelyn;Petyr,Littlefinger,Varys,Lord,;0.15;3842;128
" Good lady , " Varys said with great solicitude . " There are men in the Free Cities with wondrous healing powers . Say only the word , and I will send for one for your dear Bran . ";Varys;Petyr,Littlefinger,Catelyn,Lord,;0.4625;3843;128
" Maester Luwin is doing all that can be done for Bran , " she told him .;Littlefinger;Maester,;0.0;3844;128
She would not let them see her grief . " Lord Baelish tells me that I have you to thank for bringing me here . ";Catelyn;Lord,;-0.8;3847;128
Varys giggled like a little girl . " Oh , yes . I suppose I am guilty . I hope you forgive me , kind lady . ";Varys;Petyr,Littlefinger,Catelyn,Lord,;-0.0291666666667;3848;128
He eased himself down into a seat and put his hands together . " I wonder if we might trouble you to show us the dagger ? ";Littlefinger;Petyr,Catelyn,Varys,Lord,;-0.155555555556;3849;128
He knew things no one could possibly know , unless ... " What have you done to Ser Rodrik ? ";Varys;Petyr,Littlefinger,Catelyn,Lord,;0.0;3852;128
Littlefinger was lost . " I feel rather like the knight who arrives at the battle without his lance . What dagger are we talking about ? Who is Ser Rodrik ? ";Littlefinger;Rodrik,;0.0;3854;128
" Ser Rodrik Cassel is master-at-arms at Winterfell , " Varys informed him . " I assure you , Lady Stark , nothing at all has been done to the good knight . He did call here early this afternoon . He visited with Ser Aron Santagar in the armory , and they talked of a certain dagger . About sunset , they left the castle together and walked to that dreadful hovel where you were staying . They are still there , drinking in the common room , waiting for your return . Ser Rodrik was very distressed to find you gone . ";Varys;Serrett,Rodrik,;-0.0419642857143;3855;128
" How could you know all that ? ";Littlefinger;Petyr,Catelyn,Varys,Lord,;0.0;3856;128
" The whisperings of little birds , " Varys said , smiling . " I know things , sweet lady . That is the nature of my service . ";Varys;Petyr,Littlefinger,Catelyn,Lord,;0.08125;3857;128
He shrugged . " You do have the dagger with you , yes ? ";Littlefinger;Petyr,Catelyn,Varys,Lord,;0.0;3858;128
Catelyn pulled it out from beneath her cloak and threw it down on the table in front of him . " Here . Perhaps your little birds will whisper the name of the man it belongs to . ";Catelyn;Petyr,Littlefinger,Varys,Lord,;-0.171527777778;3859;128
" Careful , " Catelyn told him , " it 's sharp . ";Catelyn;Petyr,Littlefinger,Varys,Lord,;-0.1125;3862;128
" Nothing holds an edge like Valyrian steel , " Littlefinger said as Varys sucked at his bleeding thumb and looked at Catelyn with sullen admonition .;Littlefinger;Petyr,Catelyn,Varys,Lord,;0.0;3863;128
He flipped it in the air , caught it again with his other hand . " Such sweet balance . You want to find the owner , is that the reason for this visit ? You have no need of Ser Aron for that , my lady . You should have come to me . ";Varys;Petyr,Littlefinger,Catelyn,Lord,;0.075;3865;128
" And if I had , " she said , " what would you have told me ? ";Littlefinger;Petyr,Catelyn,Varys,Lord,;0.0;3866;128
" I would have told you that there was only one knife like this at King 's Landing . ";Varys;Petyr,Littlefinger,Catelyn,Lord,;0.0;3867;128
It struck the door and buried itself deep in the oak , quivering . " It 's mine . ";Littlefinger;Petyr,Catelyn,Varys,Lord,;0.0;3869;128
" Yours ? ";Petyr;Littlefinger,Catelyn,Varys,Lord,;0.0;3870;128
" Until the tourney on Prince Joffrey 's name day , " he said , crossing the room to wrench the dagger from the wood . " I backed Ser Jaime in the jousting , along with half the court . ";Littlefinger;Jaime,;-0.166666666667;3873;128
Petyr 's sheepish grin made him look half a boy again . " When Loras Tyrell unhorsed him , many of us became a trifle poorer . Ser Jaime lost a hundred golden dragons , the queen lost an emerald pendant , and I lost my knife . Her Grace got the emerald back , but the winner kept the rest . ";Petyr;Loras,Jaime,Grace,;0.158333333333;3874;128
" Who ? ";Littlefinger;Petyr,Catelyn,Varys,Lord,;0.0;3875;128
" The Imp , " said Littlefinger as Lord Varys watched her face . " Tyrion Lannister . ";Lord;Petyr,Littlefinger,Catelyn,Varys,;0.0;3878;128
" Enough ! ";Alliser;Grenn,Jon,;0.0;3890;129
Grenn cradled his hand . " The bastard broke my wrist . ";Grenn;Alliser,Jon,;0.0;3892;129
" The bastard hamstrung you , opened your empty skull , and cut off your hand . Or would have , if these blades had an edge . It 's fortunate for you that the Watch needs stableboys as well as rangers . ";Jon;Grenn,Alliser,;0.15;3893;129
Ser Alliser gestured at Jeren and Toad . " Get the Aurochs on his feet , he has funeral arrangements to make . ";Alliser;Aurochs,;0.0;3894;129
" That is a longsword , not an old man 's cane , " Ser Alliser said sharply . " Are your legs hurting , Lord Snow ? ";Alliser;Grenn,Jon,;0.1;3898;129
He slid the longsword back into its scabbard . " No , " he replied .;Grenn;Alliser,Jon,;0.0;3901;129
He was a compact man of fifty years , spare and hard , with grey in his black hair and eyes like chips of onyx . " The truth now , " he commanded .;Alliser;Grenn,Jon,;-0.169444444444;3903;129
" I 'm tired , " Jon admitted .;Jon;Grenn,Alliser,;-0.4;3904;129
" What you are is weak . ";Alliser;Grenn,Jon,;-0.375;3906;129
" I won . ";Grenn;Alliser,Jon,;0.0;3907;129
" No . The Aurochs lost . ";Jon;Aurochs,;0.0;3908;129
" That will be all , " Thorne told them . " I can only stomach so much ineptitude in any one day . If the Others ever come for us , I pray they have archers , because you lot are fit for nothing more than arrow fodder . ";Alliser;Grenn,Jon,;0.25;3914;129
Benjen refused him curtly . " This is not Winterfell , " he told him as he cut his meat with fork and dagger . " On the Wall , a man gets only what he earns . You 're no ranger , Jon , only a green boy with the smell of summer still on you . ";Benjen;Jon,Stark,;-0.0666666666667;3941;130
Stupidly , Jon argued . " I 'll be fifteen on my name day , " he said . " Almost a man grown . ";Jon;Benjen,Stark,;0.0;3942;130
Benjen Stark frowned . " A boy you are , and a boy you 'll remain until Ser Alliser says you are fit to be a man of the Night 's Watch . If you thought your Stark blood would win you easy favors , you were wrong . We put aside our old families when we swear our vows . Your father will always have a place in my heart , but these are my brothers now . ";Stark;Alliser,;0.119047619048;3943;130
Ben Stark smiled at that , but he had no smile for his nephew . " How often must I tell you no , Jon ? We 'll speak when I return . ";Stark;Benjen,Jon,;0.233333333333;3947;130
He missed the girls too , even Sansa , who never called him anything but " my half brother " since she was old enough to understand what bastard meant .;Sansa;;-0.0222222222222;3956;131
" You broke my wrist , bastard boy . ";Sansa;;0.0;3962;131
Jon stood up . " I 'll break the other one for you if you ask nicely . ";Jon;;-0.125;3971;132
" Maybe we 'll break you , " one of the rapers said .;Jon;;0.0;3975;132
" Try . ";Jon;;0.0;3976;132
" You make us look bad , " complained Toad .;Jon;;-0.458333333333;3978;132
" You looked bad before I ever met you , " Jon told him .;Jon;;-0.616666666667;3979;132
Toad stepped close . " The little lordling has a mouth on him , " he said .;Jon;;-0.1875;3982;132
He had pig eyes , small and shiny . " Is that your mommy 's mouth , bastard ? What was she , some whore ? Tell us her name . Maybe I had her a time or two . ";Jon;;-0.25;3983;132
Jon was rolling away from the blows when a booming voice cut through the gloom of the armory . " STOP THIS ! NOW ! ";Jon;Noye,Grenn,Stark,;0.0;3990;133
Donal Noye stood glowering at them . " The yard is for fighting , " the armorer said . " Keep your quarrels out of my armory , or I 'll make them my quarrels . You wo n't like that . ";Noye;Jon,Grenn,Stark,;0.0;3992;133
His fingers came away bloody . " He tried to kill me . ";Jon;Noye,Grenn,Stark,;-0.8;3994;133
" ' S true . I saw it , " one of the rapers put in .;Noye;Jon,Grenn,Stark,;0.35;3995;133
" He broke my wrist , " Grenn said again , holding it out to Noye for inspection .;Grenn;Jon,Noye,Stark,;0.0;3996;133
The armorer gave the offered wrist the briefest of glances . " A bruise . Perhaps a sprain . Maestor Aemon will give you a salve . Go with him , Todder , that head wants looking after . The rest of you , return to your cells . Not you , Snow . You stay . ";Jon;Aemon,;0.2;3997;133
" The Watch has need of every man it can get , " Donal Noye said when they were alone . " Even men like Toad . You wo n't win any honors killing him . ";Noye;Jon,Grenn,Stark,;0.8;4000;133
Jon 's anger flared . " He said my mother was - ";Jon;Noye,Grenn,Stark,;-0.7;4001;133
" - a whore . I heard him . What of it ? ";Noye;Jon,Grenn,Stark,;0.0;4002;133
" Lord Eddard Stark was not a man to sleep with whores , " Jon said icily . " His honor - ";Jon;Lord,;-0.2;4003;133
" - did not prevent him from fathering a bastard . Did it ? ";Noye;Jon,Grenn,Stark,;0.0;4004;133
Jon was cold with rage . " Can I go ? ";Jon;Noye,Grenn,Stark,;-0.6;4005;133
" You go when I tell you to go . ";Noye;Jon,Grenn,Stark,;0.0;4006;133
Jon stared sullenly at the smoke rising from the brazier , until Noye took him under the chin , thick fingers twisting his head around . " Look at me when I 'm talking to you , boy . ";Jon;Noye,Grenn,Stark,;-0.3;4007;133
The left sleeve of his black wool tunic was fastened at the shoulder with a silver pin in the shape of a longsword . " Words wo n't make your mother a whore . She was what she was , and nothing Toad says can change that . You know , we have men on the Wall whose mothers were whores . ";Noye;Jon,Grenn,Stark,;-0.0833333333333;4011;133
" You think you had it hard , being a high lord 's bastard ? ";Stark;Jon,Noye,Grenn,;-0.0658333333333;4016;133
the armorer went on . " That boy Jeren is a septon 's get , and Cotter Pyke is the baseborn son of a tavern wench . Now he commands Eastwatch by the Sea . ";Noye;Jeren,;0.0;4017;133
" I do n't care , " Jon said . " I do n't care about them and I do n't care about you or Thorne or Benjen Stark or any of it . I hate it here . It 's too ... it 's cold . ";Jon;Noye,Grenn,Stark,;-0.533333333333;4018;133
" Yes . Cold and hard and mean , that 's the Wall , and the men who walk it . Not like the stories your wet nurse told you . Well , piss on the stories and piss on your wet nurse . This is the way it is , and you 're here for life , same as the rest of us . ";Noye;King,;-0.234027777778;4019;133
" Life , " Jon repeated bitterly .;Jon;Noye,Grenn,Stark,;0.0;4020;133
" Yes , life , " Noye said . " A long life or a short one , it 's up to you , Snow . The road you 're walking , one of your brothers will slit your throat for you one night . ";Noye;Jon,;-0.025;4028;134
" They 're not my brothers , " Jon snapped . " They hate me because I 'm better than they are . ";Jon;Noye,;-0.15;4029;134
" No . They hate you because you act like you 're better than they are . They look at you and see a castle-bred bastard who thinks he 's a lordling . ";Noye;Jon,;-0.15;4030;134
The armorer leaned close . " You 're no lordling . Remember that . You 're a Snow , not a Stark . You 're a bastard and a bully . ";Noye;Snow,;-0.2;4031;134
" A bully ? ";Jon;Noye,;0.0;4032;134
The accusation was so unjust it took his breath away . " They were the ones who came after me . Four of them . ";Noye;Jon,;0.0;4034;134
" Four that you 've humiliated in the yard . Four who are probably afraid of you . I 've watched you fight . It 's not training with you . Put a good edge on your sword , and they'd be dead meat ; you know it , I know it , they know it . You leave them nothing . You shame them . Does that make you proud ? ";Jon;Noye,;0.1625;4035;134
But the armorer was taking that away too , making it sound as if he were doing something wrong . " They 're all older than me , " he said defensively .;Noye;Jon,;0.0222222222222;4039;134
" Older and bigger and stronger , that 's the truth . I 'll wager your master-at-arms taught you how to fight bigger men at Winterfell , though . Who was he , some old knight ? ";Noye;Jon,;0.0666666666667;4040;134
" Ser Rodrik Cassel , " Jon said warily .;Jon;Noye,;0.0;4041;134
Donal Noye leaned forward , into Jon 's face . " Now think on this , boy . None of these others have ever had a master-at-arms until Ser Alliser . Their fathers were farmers and wagonmen and poachers , smiths and miners and oars on a trading galley . What they know of fighting they learned between decks , in the alleys of Oldtown and Lannisport , in wayside brothels and taverns on the kingsroad . They may have clacked a few sticks together before they came here , but I promise you , not one in twenty was ever rich enough to own a real sword . ";Noye;Jon,;0.175;4044;134
His look was grim . " So how do you like the taste of your victories now , Lord Snow ? ";Noye;Jon,;-1.0;4045;134
" Do n't call me that ! ";Jon;Noye,;0.0;4046;134
Suddenly he felt ashamed and guilty . " I never ... I did n't think ... ";Noye;Jon,;-0.5;4048;134
" Best you start thinking , " Noye warned him . " That , or sleep with a dagger by your bed . Now go . ";Noye;Jon,;1.0;4049;134
The largest structure ever built by the hands of man , Benjen Stark had told Jon on the kingsroad when they had first caught sight of the Wall in the distance . " And beyond a doubt the most useless , " Tyrion Lannister had added with a grin , but even the Imp grew silent as they rode closer .;Stark;;0.01;4056;135
" Makes you wonder what lies beyond , " a familiar voice said .;Lannister;Jon,Tyrion,King,Stark,;0.375;4070;136
Jon looked around . " Lannister . I did n't see-I mean , I thought I was alone . ";Jon;Tyrion,King,Stark,Lannister,;-0.3125;4071;136
Tyrion Lannister was bundled in furs so thickly he looked like a very small bear . " There 's much to be said for taking people unawares . You never know what you might learn . ";Tyrion;Jon,King,Stark,Lannister,;-0.1125;4072;136
" You wo n't learn anything from me , " Jon told him .;Jon;Tyrion,King,Stark,Lannister,;0.0;4073;136
" Oh , I learn things everywhere I go . ";Lannister;Jon,Tyrion,King,Stark,;0.0;4077;136
The little man gestured up at the Wall with a gnarled black walking stick . " As I was saying ... why is it that when one man builds a wall , the next man immediately needs to know what 's on the other side ? ";King;Jon,Tyrion,Stark,Lannister,;-0.119791666667;4078;136
He cocked his head and looked at Jon with his curious mismatched eyes . " You do want to know what 's on the other side , do n't you ? ";Jon;Tyrion,King,Stark,Lannister,;-0.1125;4079;136
" It 's nothing special , " Jon said .;Jon;Tyrion,King,Stark,Lannister,;0.357142857143;4080;136
He wanted to ride with Benjen Stark on his rangings , deep into the mysteries of the haunted forest , wanted to fight Mance Rayder 's wildlings and ward the realm against the Others , but it was better not to speak of the things you wanted . " The rangers say it 's just woods and mountains and frozen lakes , with lots of snow and ice . ";Stark;Jon,Tyrion,King,Lannister,;0.1;4081;136
" And the grumkins and the snarks , " Tyrion said . " Let us not forget them , Lord Snow , or else what 's that big thing for ? ";Tyrion;Jon,King,Stark,Lannister,;0.0;4082;136
" Do n't call me Lord Snow . ";Jon;Lord,;0.0;4083;136
The dwarf lifted an eyebrow . " Would you rather be called the Imp ? Let them see that their words can cut you , and you 'll never be free of the mockery . If they want to give you a name , take it , make it your own . Then they ca n't hurt you with it anymore . ";Lannister;Imp,;0.5;4084;136
He gestured with his stick . " Come , walk with me . They 'll be serving some vile stew in the common hall by now , and I could do with a bowl of something hot . ";Jon;Tyrion,King,Stark,Lannister,;-0.025;4085;136
" I do n't see your wolf , " Lannister said as they walked .;Lannister;Jon,Tyrion,King,Stark,;0.0;4089;136
" I chain him up in the old stables when we 're training . They board all the horses in the east stables now , so no one bothers him . The rest of the time he stays with me . My sleeping cell is in Hardin 's Tower . ";Jon;Tyrion,King,Stark,Lannister,;0.1;4090;136
" That 's the one with the broken battlement , no ? Shattered stone in the yard below , and a lean to it like our noble king Robert after a long night 's drinking ? I thought all those buildings had been abandoned . ";Lannister;Robert,;0.05;4091;136
Jon shrugged . " No one cares where you sleep . Most of the old keeps are empty , you can pick any cell you want . ";Jon;Tyrion,King,Stark,Lannister,;0.166666666667;4092;136
Tyrion Lannister 's laughter steamed in the cold air . " I 'll be sure to tell your father to arrest more stonemasons , before your tower collapses . ";Tyrion;Jon,King,Stark,Lannister,;0.133333333333;4095;136
" It 's better that I 'm by myself , " Jon said stubbornly . " The rest of them are scared of Ghost . ";Jon;Tyrion,King,Stark,Lannister,;0.5;4099;136
" Wise boys , " Lannister said .;Lannister;Jon,Tyrion,King,Stark,;0.7;4100;136
Then he changed the subject . " The talk is , your uncle is too long away . ";Tyrion;Jon,King,Stark,Lannister,;-0.108333333333;4101;136
The dwarf had a way of sensing things , and Jon did not want him to see the guilt in his eyes . " He said he'd be back by my name day , " he admitted .;Jon;Tyrion,King,Stark,Lannister,;0.0;4103;136
His name day had come and gone , unremarked , a fortnight past . " They were looking for Ser Waymar Royce , his father is bannerman to Lord Arryn . Uncle Benjen said they might search as far as the Shadow Tower . That 's all the way up in the mountains . ";Tyrion;Benjen,;-0.075;4104;136
" I hear that a good many rangers have vanished of late , " Lannister said as they mounted the steps to the common hall .;Lannister;Jon,Tyrion,King,Stark,;0.1375;4105;136
He grinned and pulled open the door . " Perhaps the grumkins are hungry this year . ";Jon;Tyrion,King,Stark,Lannister,;0.0;4106;136
Tyrion Lannister sat across from him , sniffing at the stew suspiciously . " Barley , onion , carrot , " he muttered . " Someone should tell the cooks that turnip is n't a meat . ";Tyrion;Jon,Benjen,Alliser,Mormont,Bran,Grenn,;0.0;4113;137
" It 's mutton stew . ";Alliser;Tyrion,Jon,Benjen,Mormont,Bran,Grenn,;0.0;4114;137
" Snow . ";Jon;Tyrion,Benjen,Alliser,Mormont,Bran,Grenn,;0.0;4117;137
" The Lord Commander wants to see you . Now . ";Alliser;Lord,;0.2;4120;137
They had heard something about Benjen , he thought wildly , he was dead , the vision had come true . " Is it my uncle ? ";Benjen;Tyrion,Jon,Alliser,Mormont,Bran,Grenn,;0.075;4123;137
he blurted . " Is he returned safe ? ";Jon;Tyrion,Benjen,Alliser,Mormont,Bran,Grenn,;0.5;4124;137
" The Lord Commander is not accustomed to waiting , " was Ser Alliser 's reply . " And I am not accustomed to having my commands questioned by bastards . ";Alliser;Lord,;0.0;4125;137
Tyrion Lannister swung off the bench and rose . " Stop it , Thorne . You 're frightening the boy . ";Tyrion;Jon,Benjen,Alliser,Mormont,Bran,Grenn,;0.05;4126;137
" Keep out of matters that do n't concern you , Lannister . You have no place here . ";Jon;Tyrion,Benjen,Alliser,Mormont,Bran,Grenn,;0.0;4127;137
" I have a place at court , though , " the dwarf said , smiling . " A word in the right ear , and you 'll die a sour old man before you get another boy to train . Now tell Snow why the Old Bear needs to see him . Is there news of his uncle ? ";Tyrion;Old,Snow,;0.161904761905;4128;137
" No , " Ser Alliser said . " This is another matter entirely . A bird arrived this morning from Winterfell , with a message that concerns his brother . ";Alliser;Tyrion,Jon,Benjen,Mormont,Bran,Grenn,;0.0;4129;137
He corrected himself . " His half brother . ";Tyrion;Jon,Benjen,Alliser,Mormont,Bran,Grenn,;-0.166666666667;4130;137
" Bran , " Jon breathed , scrambling to his feet . " Something 's happened to Bran . ";Jon;Tyrion,Benjen,Alliser,Mormont,Bran,Grenn,;0.0;4131;137
Tyrion Lannister laid a hand on his arm . " Jon , " he said . " I am truly sorry . ";Tyrion;Jon,Benjen,Alliser,Mormont,Bran,Grenn,;-0.5;4132;137
By the time he burst into the presence of the Lord Commander , his boots were soaked and Jon was wild-eyed and panting . " Bran , " he said . " What does it say about Bran ? ";Jon;Tyrion,Benjen,Alliser,Mormont,Bran,Grenn,;0.0;4138;137
He had a raven on his arm , and he was feeding it kernels of corn . " I am told you can read . ";Alliser;Tyrion,Jon,Benjen,Mormont,Bran,Grenn,;0.0;4140;137
He shook the raven off , and it flapped its wings and flew to the window , where it sat watching as Mormont drew a roll of paper from his belt and handed it to Jon . " Corn , " it muttered in a raucous voice . " Corn , corn . ";Mormont;Tyrion,Jon,Benjen,Alliser,Bran,Grenn,;-0.3;4141;137
And then , through the tears , he found the sense in the words , and raised his head . " He woke up , " he said . " The gods gave him back . ";Jon;Tyrion,Benjen,Alliser,Mormont,Bran,Grenn,;0.0;4145;137
" Crippled , " Mormont said . " I 'm sorry , boy . Read the rest of the letter . ";Mormont;Tyrion,Jon,Benjen,Alliser,Bran,Grenn,;-0.5;4146;137
Bran was going to live . " My brother is going to live , " he told Mormont .;Bran;Tyrion,Jon,Benjen,Alliser,Mormont,Grenn,;0.136363636364;4149;137
The raven flew to his shoulder , crying , " Live ! Live ! ";Alliser;Tyrion,Jon,Benjen,Mormont,Bran,Grenn,;0.0236742424242;4151;137
Jon ran down the stairs , a smile on his face and Robb 's letter in his hand . " My brother is going to live , " he told the guards .;Jon;Tyrion,Benjen,Alliser,Mormont,Bran,Grenn,;0.0936026936027;4152;137
He grabbed the little man under the arms , hoisted him up in the air , and spun him around in a circle . " Bran is going to live ! ";Tyrion;Bran,;-0.0319602272727;4155;137
Jon put him down and thrust the paper into his hands . " Here , read it , " he said .;Jon;Tyrion,Benjen,Alliser,Mormont,Bran,Grenn,;-0.155555555556;4158;137
Grenn edged backward and put up his hands . " Stay away from me now , you bastard . ";Grenn;Tyrion,Jon,Benjen,Alliser,Mormont,Bran,;0.0;4164;137
Jon smiled at him . " I 'm sorry about your wrist . Robb used the same move on me once , only with a wooden blade . It hurt like seven hells , but yours must be worse . Look , if you want , I can show you how to defend that . ";Jon;Robb,;-0.05;4165;137
Alliser Thorne overheard him . " Lord Snow wants to take my place now . ";Alliser;Lord,;0.2;4166;137
He sneered . " I'd have an easier time teaching a wolf to juggle than you will training this aurochs . ";Tyrion;I'd,;0.0;4167;137
" I 'll take that wager , Ser Alliser , " Jon said . " I'd love to see Ghost juggle . ";Jon;Tyrion,Benjen,Alliser,Mormont,Bran,Grenn,;0.5;4168;137
As the laughter rolled around him , his face darkened , and his sword hand curled into a fist . " That was a grievous error , Lord Snow , " he said at last in the acid tones of an enemy .;Alliser;;-0.4;4176;138
The honor of the Hand 's presence was requested as soon as it was convenient . " It will be convenient on the morrow , " Ned snapped as he dismounted .;Ned;councillor,Renly,Littlefinger,Maester,Varys,Lord,Winterfell,;0.0;4182;139
The steward bowed very low . " I shall give the councillors your regrets , my lord . ";Littlefinger;Ned,councillor,Renly,Maester,Varys,Lord,Winterfell,;0.0;4183;139
" No , damn it , " Ned said .;Ned;councillor,Renly,Littlefinger,Maester,Varys,Lord,Winterfell,;0.0;4184;139
It would not do to offend the council before he had even begun . " I will see them . Pray give me a few moments to change into something more presentable . ";Littlefinger;Pray,;0.15;4185;139
" Yes , my lord , " the steward said . " We have given you Lord Arryn 's former chambers in the Tower of the Hand , if it please you . I shall have your things taken there . ";Renly;Lord,;0.0;4186;139
" My thanks , " Ned said as he ripped off his riding gloves and tucked them into his belt .;Ned;councillor,Renly,Littlefinger,Maester,Varys,Lord,Winterfell,;0.2;4187;139
Ned saw Vayon Poole , his own steward , and called out . " It seems the council has urgent need of me . See that my daughters find their bedchambers , and tell Jory to keep them there . Arya is not to go exploring , " Poole bowed .;Ned;Arya,Jory,;0.6;4189;139
Ned turned back to the royal steward . " My wagons are still straggling through the city . I shall need appropriate garments . ";Ned;councillor,Renly,Littlefinger,Maester,Varys,Lord,Winterfell,;0.25;4190;139
" It will be my great pleasure , " the steward said .;Littlefinger;Ned,councillor,Renly,Maester,Varys,Lord,Winterfell,;0.8;4191;139
The councillor Ned liked least , the eunuch Varys , accosted him the moment he entered . " Lord Stark , I was grievous sad to hear about your troubles on the kingsroad . We have all been visiting the sept to light candles for Prince Joffrey . I pray for his recovery . ";councillor;Ned,Renly,Littlefinger,Maester,Varys,Lord,Winterfell,;-0.133333333333;4196;139
" Your gods have heard you , " Ned replied , cool yet polite . " The prince grows stronger every day . ";Ned;councillor,Renly,Littlefinger,Maester,Varys,Lord,Winterfell,;0.35;4198;139
" I see you have arrived safely , Lord Stark , " Renly said .;Renly;Ned,councillor,Littlefinger,Maester,Varys,Lord,Winterfell,;-0.2;4202;139
" And you as well , " Ned replied . " You must forgive me , but sometimes you look the very image of your brother Robert . ";Ned;councillor,Renly,Littlefinger,Maester,Varys,Lord,Winterfell,;0.2;4203;139
" A poor copy , " Renly said with a shrug .;Renly;Ned,councillor,Littlefinger,Maester,Varys,Lord,Winterfell,;-0.4;4204;139
" Though much better dressed , " Littlefinger quipped . " Lord Renly spends more on clothing than half the ladies of the court . ";Littlefinger;Lord,;0.277777777778;4205;139
A cloth-of-gold half cape was draped casually across one shoulder , fastened with an emerald brooch . " There are worse crimes , " Renly said with a laugh . " The way you dress , for one . ";Renly;Ned,councillor,Littlefinger,Maester,Varys,Lord,Winterfell,;-0.0888888888889;4208;139
He eyed Ned with a smile on his lips that bordered on insolence . " I have hoped to meet you for some years , Lord Stark . No doubt Lady Catelyn has mentioned me to you . ";Ned;Catelyn,;0.05;4210;139
" She has , " Ned replied with a chill in his voice .;Ned;councillor,Renly,Littlefinger,Maester,Varys,Lord,Winterfell,;0.0;4211;139
The sly arrogance of the comment rankled him . " I understand you knew my brother Brandon as well . ";Renly;Bran,;0.0;4212;139
" Rather too well , " Littlefinger said . " I still carry a token of his esteem . Did Brandon speak of me too ? ";Littlefinger;Bran,;0.0;4215;139
" Often , and with some heat , " Ned said , hoping that would end it .;Ned;councillor,Renly,Littlefinger,Maester,Varys,Lord,Winterfell,;0.0;4216;139
" I should have thought that heat ill suits you Starks , " Littlefinger said . " Here in the south , they say you are all made of ice , and melt when you ride below the Neck . ";Littlefinger;Stark,;-0.5;4218;139
" I do not plan on melting soon , Lord Baelish . You may count on it . ";Renly;Ned,councillor,Littlefinger,Maester,Varys,Lord,Winterfell,;0.0;4219;139
Ned moved to the council table and said , " Maester Pycelle , I trust you are well . ";Ned;councillor,Renly,Littlefinger,Maester,Varys,Lord,Winterfell,;0.0;4220;139
The Grand Maester smiled gently from his tall chair at the foot of the table . " Well enough for a man of my years , my lord , " he replied , " yet I do tire easily , I fear . ";Maester;Ned,councillor,Renly,Littlefinger,Varys,Lord,Winterfell,;0.366666666667;4221;139
Garnets and amethysts and black pearls adorned the metal-work , and here and there an emerald or ruby . " Perhaps we might begin soon , " the Grand Maester said , hands knitting together atop his broad stomach . " I fear I shall fall asleep if we wait much longer . ";Maester;Ned,councillor,Renly,Littlefinger,Varys,Lord,Winterfell,;0.123958333333;4225;139
" As you will . ";Littlefinger;Ned,councillor,Renly,Maester,Varys,Lord,Winterfell,;0.0;4226;139
Ned took the chair beside it , as the right hand of his king . " My lords , " he said formally , " I am sorry to have kept you waiting . ";Ned;councillor,Renly,Littlefinger,Maester,Varys,Lord,Winterfell,;-0.107142857143;4228;139
" You are the King 's Hand , " Varys said . " We serve at your pleasure , Lord Stark . ";Varys;King,;-0.2;4229;139
He thought he knew already . " We are but five , " he pointed out .;Ned;councillor,Renly,Littlefinger,Maester,Varys,Lord,Winterfell,;0.0;4234;139
" Lord Stannis took himself to Dragonstone not long after the king went north , " Varys said , " and our gallant Ser Barristan no doubt rides beside the king as he makes his way through the city , as befits the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard . ";Varys;Lord,;-0.05;4235;139
" Perhaps we had best wait for Ser Barristan and the king to join us , " Ned suggested .;Ned;councillor,Renly,Littlefinger,Maester,Varys,Lord,Winterfell,;1.0;4236;139
Renly Baratheon laughed aloud . " If we wait for my brother to grace us with his royal presence , it could be a long sit . ";Renly;Ned,councillor,Littlefinger,Maester,Varys,Lord,Winterfell,;0.325;4237;139
" Our good King Robert has many cares , " Varys said . " He entrusts some small matters to us , to lighten his load . ";Varys;King,;0.3;4238;139
" What Lord Varys means is that all this business of coin and crops and justice bores my royal brother to tears , " Lord Renly said , " so it falls to us to govern the realm . He does send us a command from time to time . ";Lord;Lord,;0.0;4239;139
He drew a tightly rolled paper from his sleeve and laid it on the table . " This morning he commanded me to ride ahead with all haste and ask Grand Maester Pycelle to convene this council at once . He has an urgent task for us . ";Ned;Maester,;0.5;4240;139
And to do this in his name , that was salt in the wound . " Gods be good , " he swore .;Littlefinger;Gods,;0.65;4245;139
" What Lord Eddard means to say , " Lord Renly announced , " is that His Grace instructs us to stage a great tournament in honor of his appointment as the Hand of the King . ";Lord;Lord,;0.8;4246;139
" How much ? ";Littlefinger;Ned,councillor,Renly,Maester,Varys,Lord,Winterfell,;0.1;4247;139
Ned read the answer off the letter . " Forty thousand golden dragons to the champion . Twenty thousand to the man who comes second , another twenty to the winner of the melee , and ten thousand to the victor of the archery competition . ";Ned;councillor,Renly,Littlefinger,Maester,Varys,Lord,Winterfell,;0.1;4249;139
" Ninety thousand gold pieces , " Littlefinger sighed . " And we must not neglect the other costs . Robert will want a prodigious feast . That means cooks , carpenters , serving girls , singers , jugglers , fools ... ";Littlefinger;Robert,;-0.125;4250;139
" Fools we have in plenty , " Lord Renly said .;Lord;Ned,councillor,Renly,Littlefinger,Maester,Varys,Winterfell,;0.0;4251;139
Grand Maester Pycelle looked to Littlefinger and asked , " Will the treasury bear the expense ? ";Maester;Ned,councillor,Renly,Littlefinger,Varys,Lord,Winterfell,;0.5;4252;139
" What treasury is that ? ";Ned;councillor,Renly,Littlefinger,Maester,Varys,Lord,Winterfell,;0.0;4253;139
Littlefinger replied with a twist of his mouth . " Spare me the foolishness , Maester . You know as well as I that the treasury has been empty for years . I shall have to borrow the money . No doubt the Lannisters will be accommodating . We owe Lord Tywin some three million dragons at present , what matter another hundred thousand ? ";Littlefinger;Lannister,;-0.05;4254;139
Ned was stunned . " Are you claiming that the Crown is three million gold pieces in debt ? ";Ned;Crown,;0.0;4255;139
" The Crown is more than six million gold pieces in debt , Lord Stark . The Lannisters are the biggest part of it , but we have also borrowed from Lord Tyrell , the Iron Bank of Braavos , and several Tyroshi trading cartels . Of late I 've had to turn to the Faith . The High Septon haggles worse than a Dornish fishmonger . ";Littlefinger;Crown,;-0.04;4256;139
Ned was aghast . " Aerys Targaryen left a treasury flowing with gold . How could you let this happen ? ";Ned;Targaryen,;-0.3;4257;139
Littlefinger gave a shrug . " The master of coin finds the money . The king and the Hand spend it . ";Littlefinger;Ned,councillor,Renly,Maester,Varys,Lord,Winterfell,;0.0;4258;139
" I will not believe that Jon Arryn allowed Robert to beggar the realm , " Ned said hotly .;Ned;Jon,;0.0;4259;139
Grand Maester Pycelle shook his great bald head , his chains clinking softly . " Lord Arryn was a prudent man , but I fear that His Grace does not always listen to wise counsel . ";Maester;Lord,Grace,;0.666666666667;4260;139
" My royal brother loves tournaments and feasts , " Renly Baratheon said , " and he loathes what he calls ' counting coppers . ' ";Renly;Ned,councillor,Littlefinger,Maester,Varys,Lord,Winterfell,;0.0;4261;139
" I will speak with His Grace , " Ned said . " This tourney is an extravagance the realm cannot afford . ";Ned;councillor,Renly,Littlefinger,Maester,Varys,Lord,Winterfell,;0.0;4262;139
" Speak to him as you will , " Lord Renly said , " we had still best make our plans . ";Lord;Ned,councillor,Renly,Littlefinger,Maester,Varys,Winterfell,;1.0;4263;139
" Another day , " Ned said .;Ned;councillor,Renly,Littlefinger,Maester,Varys,Lord,Winterfell,;0.0;4264;139
He would have to remember that he was no longer in Winterfell , where only the king stood higher ; here , he was but first among equals . " Forgive me , my lords , " he said in a softer tone . " I am tired . Let us call a halt for today and resume when we are fresher . ";Winterfell;Ned,councillor,Renly,Littlefinger,Maester,Varys,Lord,;0.025;4266;139
He crossed the outer yard , passed under a portcullis into the inner bailey , and was walking toward what he thought was the Tower of the Hand when Littlefinger appeared in front of him . " You 're going the wrong way , Stark . Come with me . ";Littlefinger;Ned,;-0.233333333333;4278;140
They were relics of the Targaryens , black steel with dragon scales cresting their helms , now dusty and forgotten . " This is not the way to my chambers , " Ned said .;Ned;Littlefinger,;-0.283333333333;4281;140
" Did I say it was ? I 'm leading you to the dungeons to slit your throat and seal your corpse up behind a wall , " Littlefinger replied , his voice dripping with sarcasm . " We have no time for this , Stark . Your wife awaits . ";Littlefinger;Ned,;-0.3;4282;140
" What game are you playing , Littlefinger ? Catelyn is at Winterfell , hundreds of leagues from here . ";Littlefinger;Catelyn,;-0.4;4283;140
" Oh ? ";Littlefinger;Ned,;0.0;4284;140
Littlefinger 's grey-green eyes glittered with amusement . " Then it appears someone has managed an astonishing impersonation . For the last time , come . Or do n't come , and I 'll keep her for myself . ";Littlefinger;Ned,;0.25;4285;140
They stepped out into the ruddy glow of dusk , on a rocky bluff high above the river . " We 're outside the castle , " Ned said .;Ned;Littlefinger,;0.0533333333333;4291;140
" You are a hard man to fool , Stark , " Littlefinger said with a smirk . " Was it the sun that gave it away , or the sky ? Follow me . There are niches cut in the rock . Try not to fall to your death , Catelyn would never understand . ";Littlefinger;Catelyn,;-0.245833333333;4292;140
He was almost down to the core . " You are growing old and slow , Stark , " he said , flipping the apple casually into the rushing water . " No matter , we ride the rest of the way . ";Littlefinger;Ned,Rodrik,Catelyn,;-0.138888888889;4299;141
Ned Stark dismounted in a fury . " A brothel , " he said as he seized Littlefinger by the shoulder and spun him around . " You 've brought me all this way to take me to a brothel . ";Ned;Littlefinger,Rodrik,Catelyn,;-0.2;4305;141
" Your wife is inside , " Littlefinger said .;Littlefinger;Ned,Rodrik,Catelyn,;0.0;4306;141
It was the final insult . " Brandon was too kind to you , " Ned said as he slammed the small man back against a wall and shoved his dagger up under the little pointed chin beard .;Ned;Bran,;0.0325;4307;141
" My lord , no , " an urgent voice called out . " He speaks the truth . ";Littlefinger;Ned,Rodrik,Catelyn,;0.0;4308;141
He was dressed in brown roughspun , and the soft flesh under his chin wobbled as he ran . " This is no business of yours , " Ned began ; then , suddenly , the recognition came .;Ned;Littlefinger,Rodrik,Catelyn,;0.1;4311;141
He lowered the dagger , astonished . " Ser Rodrik ? ";Littlefinger;Ned,Rodrik,Catelyn,;0.0;4312;141
Rodrik Cassel nodded . " Your lady awaits you upstairs . ";Rodrik;Ned,Littlefinger,Catelyn,;0.0;4313;141
Ned was lost . " Catelyn is truly here ? This is not some strange jape of Littlefinger ' s ? ";Ned;Catelyn,;-0.05;4314;141
" Would that it were , Stark , " Littlefinger said . " Follow me , and try to look a shade more lecherous and a shade less like the King 's Hand . It would not do to have you recognized . Perhaps you could fondle a breast or two , just in passing . ";Littlefinger;Ned,Rodrik,Catelyn,;0.0444444444444;4316;141
" My lady , " Ned whispered in wonderment .;Ned;Littlefinger,Rodrik,Catelyn,;0.0;4322;141
" Oh , very good , " said Littlefinger , closing the door . " You recognized her . ";Littlefinger;Ned,Rodrik,Catelyn,;0.845;4323;141
" I feared you'd never come , my lord , " she whispered against his chest . " Petyr has been bringing me reports . He told me of your troubles with Arya and the young prince . How are my girls ? ";Ned;Petyr,;0.1;4324;141
" Both in mourning , and full of anger , " he told her . " Cat , I do not understand . What are you doing in King 's Landing ? What 's happened ? ";Littlefinger;Ned,Rodrik,Catelyn,;-0.175;4325;141
Ned asked his wife . " Is it Bran ? Is he ... ";Ned;Bran,;0.0;4326;141
" It is Bran , but not as you think , " Catelyn said .;Catelyn;Bran,;0.0;4328;141
Ned was lost . " Then how ? Why are you here , my love ? What is this place ? ";Ned;Littlefinger,Rodrik,Catelyn,;0.5;4329;141
" Just what it appears , " Littlefinger said , easing himself onto a window seat . " A brothel . Can you think of a less likely place to find a Catelyn Tully ? ";Littlefinger;Catelyn,;-0.0833333333333;4330;141
He smiled . " As it chances , I own this particular establishment , so arrangements were easily made . I am most anxious to keep the Lannisters from learning that Cat is here in King 's Landing . ";Catelyn;Cat,Lannister,;0.323333333333;4331;141
" Why ? ";Ned;Littlefinger,Rodrik,Catelyn,;0.0;4332;141
He saw her hands then , the awkward way she held them , the raw red scars , the stiffness of the last two fingers on her left . " You 've been hurt . ";Littlefinger;Ned,Rodrik,Catelyn,;-0.166153846154;4334;141
He took her hands in his own , turned them over . " Gods . Those are deep cuts ... a gash from a sword or ... how did this happen , my lady ? ";Ned;Littlefinger,Rodrik,Catelyn,;0.3;4335;141
Catelyn slid a dagger out from under her cloak and placed it in his hand . " This blade was sent to open Bran 's throat and spill his life 's blood . ";Catelyn;Bran,;0.0;4336;141
Ned 's head jerked up . " But ... who ... why would ... ";Ned;Littlefinger,Rodrik,Catelyn,;0.0;4337;141
She put a finger to his lips . " Let me tell it all , my love . It will go faster that way . Listen . ";Littlefinger;Ned,Rodrik,Catelyn,;0.5;4338;141
Painfully , Ned forced his thoughts back to the dagger and what it meant . " The Imp 's dagger , " he repeated .;Ned;Littlefinger,Catelyn,Targaryen,Petyr,;-0.15;4348;142
It stood mocking him . " Why should Tyrion Lannister want Bran dead ? The boy has never done him harm . ";Littlefinger;Tyrion,;-0.2;4351;142
" Do you Starks have nought but snow between your ears ? ";Ned;Stark,;0.0;4352;142
Littlefinger asked . " The Imp would never have acted alone . ";Littlefinger;Imp,;0.0;4353;142
Ned rose and paced the length of the room . " If the queen had a role in this or , gods forbid , the king himself ... no , I will not believe that . ";Ned;Littlefinger,Catelyn,Targaryen,Petyr,;0.6;4354;142
" Most likely the king did not know , " Littlefinger said . " It would not be the first time . Our good Robert is practiced at closing his eyes to things he would rather not see . ";Littlefinger;Robert,;0.35;4358;142
Littlefinger sauntered over to the table , wrenched the knife from the wood . " The accusation is treason either way . Accuse the king and you will dance with Ilyn Payne before the words are out of your mouth . The queen ... if you can find proof , and if you can make Robert listen , then perhaps ... ";Littlefinger;Robert,;0.0;4362;142
" We have proof , " Ned said . " We have the dagger . ";Ned;Littlefinger,Catelyn,Targaryen,Petyr,;0.0;4363;142
" This ? ";Catelyn;Ned,Littlefinger,Targaryen,Petyr,;0.0;4364;142
Littlefinger flipped the knife casually end over end . " A sweet piece of steel , but it cuts two ways , my lord . The Imp will no doubt swear the blade was lost or stolen while he was at Winterfell , and with his hireling dead , who is there to give him the lie ? ";Littlefinger;Imp,;0.075;4365;142
He tossed the knife lightly to Ned . " My counsel is to drop that in the river and forget that it was ever forged . ";Ned;Littlefinger,Catelyn,Targaryen,Petyr,;0.0;4366;142
Ned regarded him coldly . " Lord Baelish , I am a Stark of Winterfell . My son lies crippled , perhaps dying . He would be dead , and Catelyn with him , but for a wolf pup we found in the snow . If you truly believe I could forget that , you are as big a fool now as when you took up sword against my brother . ";Ned;Stark,;-0.133333333333;4367;142
" A fool I may be , Stark ... yet I 'm still here , while your brother has been moldering in his frozen grave for some fourteen years now . If you are so eager to molder beside him , far be it from me to dissuade you , but I would rather not be included in the party , thank you very much . ";Littlefinger;Ned,Catelyn,Targaryen,Petyr,;0.05;4368;142
" You would be the last man I would willingly include in any party , Lord Baelish . ";Ned;Littlefinger,Catelyn,Targaryen,Petyr,;0.0;4369;142
" You wound me deeply . ";Catelyn;Ned,Littlefinger,Targaryen,Petyr,;0.0;4370;142
Littlefinger placed a hand over his heart . " For my part , I always found you Starks a tiresome lot , but Cat seems to have become attached to you , for reasons I cannot comprehend . I shall try to keep you alive for her sake . A fool 's task , admittedly , but I could never refuse your wife anything . ";Littlefinger;Cat,;-0.2;4371;142
" I told Petyr our suspicions about Jon Arryn 's death , " Catelyn said . " He has promised to help you find the truth . ";Catelyn;Ned,Littlefinger,Targaryen,Petyr,;0.0;4372;142
It would not be the first time that Ned had been forced to make common cause with a man he despised . " Very well , " he said , thrusting the dagger into his belt . " You spoke of Varys . Does the eunuch know all of it ? ";Ned;Littlefinger,Catelyn,Targaryen,Petyr,;-0.0375;4374;142
" Not from my lips , " Catelyn said . " You did not wed a fool , Eddard Stark . But Varys has ways of learning things that no man could know . He has some dark art , Ned , I swear it . ";Catelyn;Varys,;-0.175;4375;142
" He has spies , that is well known , " Ned said , dismissive .;Ned;Littlefinger,Catelyn,Targaryen,Petyr,;0.0;4376;142
" It is more than that , " Catelyn insisted . " Ser Rodrik spoke to Ser Aron Santagar in all secrecy , yet somehow the Spider knew of their conversation . I fear that man . ";Catelyn;Rodrik,;0.5;4377;142
Littlefinger smiled . " Leave Lord Varys to me , sweet lady . If you will permit me a small obscenity-and where better for it than here-I hold the man 's balls in the palm of my hand . ";Littlefinger;Lord,;0.3;4378;142
He cupped his fingers , smiling . " Or would , if he were a man , or had any balls . You see , if the pie is opened , the birds begin to sing , and Varys would not like that . Were I you , I would worry more about the Lannisters and less about the eunuch . ";Ned;Varys,;0.166666666667;4379;142
He was thinking of the boy Mycah , of Jon Arryn 's sudden death , of Bran 's fall , of old mad Aerys Targaryen dying on the floor of his throne room while his life 's blood dried on a gilded blade . " My lady , " he said , turning to Catelyn , " there is nothing more you can do here . I want you to return to Winterfell at once . If there was one assassin , there could be others . Whoever ordered Bran 's death will learn soon enough that the boy still lives . ";Targaryen;Bran,;-0.0375;4382;142
" I had hoped to see the girls ... ";Ned;Littlefinger,Catelyn,Targaryen,Petyr,;0.0;4383;142
" That would be most unwise , " Littlefinger put in . " The Red Keep is full of curious eyes , and children talk . ";Littlefinger;Ned,Catelyn,Targaryen,Petyr,;0.1875;4385;142
" He speaks truly , my love , " Ned told her .;Ned;Littlefinger,Catelyn,Targaryen,Petyr,;0.5;4386;142
He embraced her . " Take Ser Rodrik and ride for Winterfell . I will watch over the girls . Go home to our sons and keep them safe . ";Littlefinger;Rodrik,;0.5;4387;142
" As you say , my lord . ";Ned;Littlefinger,Catelyn,Targaryen,Petyr,;0.0;4388;142
" Would the lord and lady like the use of a bedchamber ? ";Catelyn;Ned,Littlefinger,Targaryen,Petyr,;0.0;4391;142
asked Littlefinger . " I should warn you , Stark , we usually charge for that sort of thing around here . ";Littlefinger;Ned,Catelyn,Targaryen,Petyr,;-0.2;4392;142
" A moment alone , that 's all I ask , " Catelyn said .;Catelyn;Ned,Littlefinger,Targaryen,Petyr,;0.0;4393;142
" Very well . ";Ned;Littlefinger,Catelyn,Targaryen,Petyr,;0.2;4394;142
Littlefinger strolled to the door . " Do n't be too long . It is past time the Hand and I returned to the castle , before our absence is noted . ";Littlefinger;Ned,Catelyn,Targaryen,Petyr,;-0.15;4395;142
Catelyn went to him and took his hands in her own . " I will not forget the help you gave me , Petyr . When your men came for me , I did not know whether they were taking me to a friend or an enemy . I have found you more than a friend . I have found a brother I'd thought lost . ";Catelyn;I'd,;0.55;4396;142
Petyr Baelish smiled . " I am desperately sentimental , sweet lady . Best not tell anyone . I have spent years convincing the court that I am wicked and cruel , and I should hate to see all that hard work go for naught . ";Petyr;Ned,Littlefinger,Catelyn,Targaryen,;0.0135416666667;4397;142
Ned believed not a word of that , but he kept his voice polite as he said , " You have my thanks as well , Lord Baelish . ";Ned;Littlefinger,Catelyn,Targaryen,Petyr,;0.2;4398;142
" Oh , now there 's a treasure , " Littlefinger said , exiting .;Littlefinger;Ned,Catelyn,Targaryen,Petyr,;0.0;4399;142
When the door had closed behind him , Ned turned back to his wife . " Once you are home , send word to Helman Tallhart and Galbart Glover under my seal . They are to raise a hundred bowmen each and fortify Moat Cailin . Two hundred determined archers can hold the Neck against an army . Instruct Lord Manderly that he is to strengthen and repair all his defenses at White Harbor , and see that they are well manned . And from this day on , I want a careful watch kept over Theon Greyjoy . If there is war , we shall have sore need of his father 's fleet . ";Ned;Cailin,Neck,;-0.12;4400;142
" War ? ";Littlefinger;Ned,Catelyn,Targaryen,Petyr,;0.0;4401;142
" It will not come to that , " Ned promised her , praying it was true .;Ned;Littlefinger,Catelyn,Targaryen,Petyr,;0.35;4403;142
He took her in his arms again . " The Lannisters are merciless in the face of weakness , as Aerys Targaryen learned to his sorrow , but they would not dare attack the north without all the power of the realm behind them , and that they shall not have . I must play out this fool 's masquerade as if nothing is amiss . Remember why I came here , my love . If I find proof that the Lannisters murdered Jon Arryn ... ";Littlefinger;Lannister,Jon,;-0.2;4404;142
Her scarred hands clung to him . " If , " she said , " what then , my love ? ";Catelyn;Ned,Littlefinger,Targaryen,Petyr,;0.5;4406;142
That was the most dangerous part , Ned knew . " All justice flows from the king , " he told her . " When I know the truth , I must go to Robert . ";Ned;Littlefinger,Catelyn,Targaryen,Petyr,;-0.05;4407;142
" Are you certain that you must leave us so soon ? ";Lord;Tyrion,Commander,Alliser,Marsh,Jaremy,Maester,Night,Mormont,Old,;0.214285714286;4412;143
" Past certain , Lord Mormont , " Tyrion replied . " My brother Jaime will be wondering what has become of me . He may decide that you have convinced me to take the black . ";Tyrion;Jaime,;-0.0674603174603;4414;143
" Would that I could . ";Lord;Tyrion,Commander,Alliser,Marsh,Jaremy,Maester,Night,Mormont,Old,;0.0;4415;143
Old as he was , the Lord Commander still had the strength of a bear . " You 're a cunning man , Tyrion . We have need of men of your sort on the Wall . ";Commander;Tyrion,Alliser,Lord,Marsh,Jaremy,Maester,Night,Mormont,Old,;0.05;4417;143
Tyrion grinned . " Then I shall scour the Seven Kingdoms for dwarfs and ship them all to you , Lord Mormont . ";Tyrion;Commander,Alliser,Lord,Marsh,Jaremy,Maester,Night,Mormont,Old,;0.0;4418;143
Ser Alliser Thorne was the only man at table who did not so much as crack a smile . " Lannister mocks us . ";Alliser;Tyrion,Commander,Lord,Marsh,Jaremy,Maester,Night,Mormont,Old,;0.133333333333;4421;143
" Only you , Ser Alliser , " Tyrion said .;Tyrion;Commander,Alliser,Lord,Marsh,Jaremy,Maester,Night,Mormont,Old,;0.0;4422;143
Thorne 's black eyes fixed on Tyrion with loathing . " You have a bold tongue for someone who is less than half a man . Perhaps you and I should visit the yard together . ";Alliser;Tyrion,Commander,Lord,Marsh,Jaremy,Maester,Night,Mormont,Old,;-0.0133333333333;4424;143
" Why ? ";Lord;Tyrion,Commander,Alliser,Marsh,Jaremy,Maester,Night,Mormont,Old,;0.0;4425;143
asked Tyrion . " The crabs are here . ";Tyrion;Commander,Alliser,Lord,Marsh,Jaremy,Maester,Night,Mormont,Old,;0.0;4426;143
Ser Alliser stood up , his mouth a tight line . " Come and make your japes with steel in your hand . ";Alliser;Tyrion,Commander,Lord,Marsh,Jaremy,Maester,Night,Mormont,Old,;-0.178571428571;4428;143
Tyrion looked pointedly at his right hand . " Why , I have steel in my hand , Ser Alliser , although it appears to be a crab fork . Shall we duel ? ";Tyrion;Commander,Alliser,Lord,Marsh,Jaremy,Maester,Night,Mormont,Old,;0.285714285714;4429;143
Even his raven joined in , cawing loudly from above the window . " Duel ! Duel ! Duel ! ";Lord;Tyrion,Commander,Alliser,Marsh,Jaremy,Maester,Night,Mormont,Old,;0.0;4433;143
Tyrion pounded him on the back . " To the victor goes the spoils , " he called out . " I claim Thorne 's share of the crabs . ";Tyrion;Commander,Alliser,Lord,Marsh,Jaremy,Maester,Night,Mormont,Old,;0.0;4436;143
Finally the Lord Commander recovered himself . " You are a wicked man , to provoke our Ser Alliser so , " he scolded .;Lord;Tyrion,Commander,Alliser,Marsh,Jaremy,Maester,Night,Mormont,Old,;0.0;4437;143
Tyrion seated himself and took a sip of wine . " If a man paints a target on his chest , he should expect that sooner or later someone will loose an arrow at him . I have seen dead men with more humor than your Ser Alliser . ";Tyrion;Commander,Alliser,Lord,Marsh,Jaremy,Maester,Night,Mormont,Old,;0.0557692307692;4438;143
" Not so , " objected the Lord Steward , Bowen Marsh , a man as round and red as a pomegranate . " You ought to hear the droll names he gives the lads he trains . ";Marsh;Tyrion,Commander,Alliser,Lord,Jaremy,Maester,Night,Mormont,Old,;-0.1;4439;143
Tyrion had heard a few of those droll names . " I 'll wager the lads have a few names for him as well , " he said . " Chip the ice off your eyes , my good lords . Ser Alliser Thorne should be mucking out your stables , not drilling your young warriors . ";Tyrion;Alliser,;0.0875;4440;143
" The Watch has no shortage of stableboys , " Lord Mormont grumbled . " That seems to be all they send us these days . Stableboys and sneak thieves and rapers . Ser Alliser is an anointed knight , one of the few to take the black since I have been Lord Commander . He fought bravely at King 's Landing . ";Lord;Alliser,Lord,;-0.183333333333;4441;143
" On the wrong side , " Ser Jaremy Rykker commented dryly . " I ought to know , I was there on the battlements beside him . Tywin Lannister gave us a splendid choice . Take the black , or see our heads on spikes before evenfall . No offense intended , Tyrion . ";Jaremy;Lannister,;0.0555555555556;4442;143
" None taken , Ser Jaremy . My father is very fond of spiked heads , especially those of people who have annoyed him in some fashion . And a face as noble as yours , well , no doubt he saw you decorating the city wall above the King 's Gate . I think you would have looked very striking up there . ";Tyrion;Commander,Alliser,Lord,Marsh,Jaremy,Maester,Night,Mormont,Old,;0.175;4443;143
" Thank you , " Ser Jaremy replied with a sardonic smile .;Jaremy;Tyrion,Commander,Alliser,Lord,Marsh,Maester,Night,Mormont,Old,;0.3;4444;143
Lord Commander Mormont cleared his throat . " Sometimes I fear Ser Alliser saw you true , Tyrion . You do mock us and our noble purpose here . ";Lord;Alliser,;0.475;4445;143
Tyrion shrugged . " We all need to be mocked from time to time , Lord Mormont , lest we start to take ourselves too seriously . More wine , please . ";Tyrion;Commander,Alliser,Lord,Marsh,Jaremy,Maester,Night,Mormont,Old,;0.2;4446;143
As Rykker filled it for him , Bowen Marsh said , " You have a great thirst for a small man . ";Jaremy;Tyrion,Commander,Alliser,Lord,Marsh,Maester,Night,Mormont,Old,;0.316666666667;4448;143
" Oh , I think that Lord Tyrion is quite a large man , " Maester Aemon said from the far end of the table .;Maester;Tyrion,Commander,Alliser,Lord,Marsh,Jaremy,Night,Mormont,Old,;0.157142857143;4449;143
He spoke softly , yet the high officers of the Night 's Watch all fell quiet , the better to hear what the ancient had to say . " I think he is a giant come among us , here at the end of the world . ";Night;Tyrion,Commander,Alliser,Lord,Marsh,Jaremy,Maester,Mormont,Old,;0.165;4450;143
Tyrion answered gently , " I 've been called many things , my lord , but giant is seldom one of them . ";Tyrion;Commander,Alliser,Lord,Marsh,Jaremy,Maester,Night,Mormont,Old,;0.25;4451;143
" Nonetheless , " Maester Aemon said as his clouded , milk-white eyes moved to Tyrion 's face , " I think it is true . ";Maester;Tyrion,Commander,Alliser,Lord,Marsh,Jaremy,Night,Mormont,Old,;0.35;4452;143
He could only bow his head politely and say , " You are too kind , Maester Aemon . ";Tyrion;Commander,Alliser,Lord,Marsh,Jaremy,Maester,Night,Mormont,Old,;0.3;4454;143
He was a tiny thing , wrinkled and hairless , shrunken beneath the weight of a hundred years so his maester 's collar with its links of many metals hung loose about his throat . " I have been called many things , my lord , " he said , " but kind is seldom one of them . ";Mormont;Tyrion,Commander,Alliser,Lord,Marsh,Jaremy,Maester,Night,Old,;0.304615384615;4456;143
Much later , when the serious business of eating was done and the others had left , Mormont offered Tyrion a chair beside the fire and a cup of mulled spirits so strong they brought tears to his eyes . " The kingsroad can be perilous this far north , " the Lord Commander told him as they drank .;Lord;Tyrion,Commander,Alliser,Marsh,Jaremy,Maester,Night,Mormont,Old,;0.04;4458;143
" I have Jyck and Morrec , " Tyrion said , " and Yoren is riding south again . ";Tyrion;Jyck,;0.0;4459;143
" Yoren is only one man . The Watch shall escort you as far as Winterfell , " Mormont announced in a tone that brooked no argument . " Three men should be sufficient . ";Mormont;Yoren,;0.05;4460;143
" If you insist , my lord , " Tyrion said . " You might send young Snow . He would be glad for a chance to see his brothers . ";Tyrion;Snow,;0.3;4461;143
Mormont frowned through his thick grey beard . " Snow ? Oh , the Stark bastard . I think not . The young ones need to forget the lives they left behind them , the brothers and mothers and all that . A visit home would only stir up feelings best left alone . I know these things . My own blood kin ... my sister Maege rules Bear Island now , since my son 's dishonor . I have nieces I have never seen . ";Mormont;Tyrion,Commander,Alliser,Lord,Marsh,Jaremy,Maester,Night,Old,;0.075;4462;143
He took a swallow . " Besides , Jon Snow is only a boy . You shall have three strong swords , to keep you safe . ";Tyrion;Jon,;0.311111111111;4463;143
" I am touched by your concern , Lord Mormont . ";Lord;Tyrion,Commander,Alliser,Marsh,Jaremy,Maester,Night,Mormont,Old,;0.0;4464;143
The strong drink was making Tyrion light-headed , but not so drunk that he did not realize that the Old Bear wanted something from him . " I hope I can repay your kindness . ";Old;Tyrion,Commander,Alliser,Lord,Marsh,Jaremy,Maester,Night,Mormont,;0.0111111111111;4465;143
" You can , " Mormont said bluntly . " Your sister sits beside the king . Your brother is a great knight , and your father the most powerful lord in the Seven Kingdoms . Speak to them for us . Tell them of our need here . You have seen for yourself , my lord . The Night 's Watch is dying . Our strength is less than a thousand now . Six hundred here , two hundred in the Shadow Tower , even fewer at Eastwatch , and a scant third of those fighting men . The Wall is a hundred leagues long . Think on that . Should an attack come , I have three men to defend each mile of wall . ";Mormont;King,;0.230555555556;4466;143
" Three and a third , " Tyrion said with a yawn .;Tyrion;Commander,Alliser,Lord,Marsh,Jaremy,Maester,Night,Mormont,Old,;0.0;4467;143
The old man warmed his hands before the fire . " I sent Benjen Stark to search after Yohn Royce 's son , lost on his first ranging . The Royce boy was green as summer grass , yet he insisted on the honor of his own command , saying it was his due as a knight . I did not wish to offend his lord father , so I yielded . I sent him out with two men I deemed as good as any in the Watch . More fool I. ";Lord;Stark,;0.196875;4469;143
" Fool , " the raven agreed .;Tyrion;Commander,Alliser,Lord,Marsh,Jaremy,Maester,Night,Mormont,Old,;0.0;4470;143
The bird peered down at him with those beady black eyes , ruffling its wings . " Fool , " it called again .;Mormont;Tyrion,Commander,Alliser,Lord,Marsh,Jaremy,Maester,Night,Old,;-0.161111111111;4472;143
The Lord Commander took no notice of the irritating bird . " Gared was near as old as I am and longer on the Wall , " he went on , " yet it would seem he forswore himself and fled . I should never have believed it , not of him , but Lord Eddard sent me his head from Winterfell . Of Royce , there is no word . One deserter and two men lost , and now Ben Stark too has gone missing . ";Lord;Gared,Lord,Stark,;-0.12;4475;143
He sighed deeply . " Who am I to send searching after him ? In two years I will be seventy . Too old and too weary for the burden I bear , yet if I set it down , who will pick it up ? Alliser Thorne ? Bowen Marsh ? I would have to be as blind as Maester Aemon not to see what they are . The Night 's Watch has become an army of sullen boys and tired old men . Apart from the men at my table tonight , I have perhaps twenty who can read , and even fewer who can think , or plan , or lead . Once the Watch spent its summers building , and each Lord Commander raised the Wall higher than he found it . Now it is all we can do to stay alive . ";Mormont;Lord,King,;-0.0722222222222;4476;143
Lord Mormont had spent a good part of his life on the Wall , and he needed to believe if those years were to have any meaning . " I promise , the king will hear of your need , " Tyrion said gravely , " and I will speak to my father and my brother Jaime as well . ";Tyrion;Commander,Alliser,Lord,Marsh,Jaremy,Maester,Night,Mormont,Old,;0.65;4479;143
" You are a young man , Tyrion , " Mormont said . " How many winters have you seen ? ";Mormont;Tyrion,Commander,Alliser,Lord,Marsh,Jaremy,Maester,Night,Old,;0.3;4483;143
He shrugged . " Eight , nine . I misremember . ";Tyrion;Commander,Alliser,Lord,Marsh,Jaremy,Maester,Night,Mormont,Old,;0.0;4484;143
" And all of them short . ";Lord;Tyrion,Commander,Alliser,Marsh,Jaremy,Maester,Night,Mormont,Old,;0.0;4485;143
" As you say , my lord . ";Tyrion;Commander,Alliser,Lord,Marsh,Jaremy,Maester,Night,Mormont,Old,;0.0;4486;143
" When I was a boy , it was said that a long summer always meant a long winter to come . This summer has lasted nine years , Tyrion , and a tenth will soon be upon us . Think on that . ";Lord;Tyrion,Commander,Alliser,Marsh,Jaremy,Maester,Night,Mormont,Old,;-0.05;4488;143
" When I was a boy , " Tyrion replied , " my wet nurse told me that one day , if men were good , the gods would give the world a summer without ending . Perhaps we 've been better than we thought , and the Great Summer is finally at hand . ";Tyrion;Greatjon,;0.4625;4489;143
The Lord Commander did not seem amused . " You are not fool enough to believe that , my lord . Already the days grow shorter . There can be no mistake , Aemon has had letters from the Citadel , findings in accord with his own . The end of summer stares us in the face . ";Lord;Aemon,;0.3;4491;143
Mormont reached out and clutched Tyrion tightly by the hand . " You must make them understand . I tell you , my lord , the darkness is coming . There are wild things in the woods , direwolves and mammoths and snow bears the size of aurochs , and I have seen darker shapes in my dreams . ";Mormont;Tyrion,Commander,Alliser,Lord,Marsh,Jaremy,Maester,Night,Old,;0.1;4492;143
" In your dreams , " Tyrion echoed , thinking how badly he needed another strong drink .;Tyrion;Commander,Alliser,Lord,Marsh,Jaremy,Maester,Night,Mormont,Old,;0.433333333333;4493;143
Mormont was deaf to the edge in his voice . " The fisherfolk near Eastwatch have glimpsed white walkers on the shore . ";Mormont;Sea,;0.05;4494;143
This time Tyrion could not hold his tongue . " The fisherfolk of Lannisport often glimpse merlings . ";Tyrion;Lannisport,;0.0;4495;143
" Denys Mallister writes that the mountain people are moving south , slipping past the Shadow Tower in numbers greater than ever before . They are running , my lord ... but running from what ? ";Mormont;Denys,Tower,;0.05;4496;143
Lord Mormont moved to the window and stared out into the night . " These are old bones , Lannister , but they have never felt a chill like this . Tell the king what I say , I pray you . Winter is coming , and when the Long Night falls , only the Night 's Watch will stand between the realm and the darkness that sweeps from the north . The gods help us all if we are not ready . ";Lord;Winterfell,;0.0625;4497;143
" The gods help me if I do not get some sleep tonight . Yoren is determined to ride at first light . ";Mormont;Yoren,;0.325;4498;143
Tyrion got to his feet , sleepy from wine and tired of doom . " I thank you for all the courtesies you have done me , Lord Mormont . ";Tyrion;Commander,Alliser,Lord,Marsh,Jaremy,Maester,Night,Mormont,Old,;-0.4;4499;143
" Tell them , Tyrion . Tell them and make them believe . That is all the thanks I need . ";Lord;Tyrion,Commander,Alliser,Marsh,Jaremy,Maester,Night,Mormont,Old,;0.2;4500;143
Finally a thick voice behind him said , " Seven hells , it 's the dwarf , " and the cage jerked to a sudden stop and hung there , swinging slowly back and forth , the ropes creaking .;Mole;Tyrion,;-0.175;4531;144
" Bring him in , damn it . ";Mole;Tyrion,;0.0;4532;144
Their faces were muffled in woolen scarves so only their eyes showed , and they were plump with layers of wool and leather , black on black . " And what will you be wanting , this time of night ? ";Tyrion;Mole,;-0.111111111111;4536;144
" A last look . ";Mole;Tyrion,;0.0;4538;144
The men exchanged sour glances . " Look all you want , " the other one said . " Just have a care you do n't fall off , little man . The Old Bear would have our hides . ";Tyrion;Old,;-0.0708333333333;4539;144
On the far side of the catapult , a muffled voice called out a challenge . " Who goes there ? Halt ! ";Tyrion;Jon,;0.125;4552;145
Tyrion stopped . " If I halt too long I 'll freeze in place , Jon , " he said as a shaggy pale shape slid toward him silently and sniffed at his furs . " Hello , Ghost . ";Tyrion;Jon,;-0.05;4553;145
He looked bigger and heavier in his layers of fur and leather , the hood of his cloak pulled down over his face . " Lannister , " he said , yanking loose the scarf to uncover his mouth . " This is the last place I would have expected to see you . ";Tyrion;Jon,;-0.0664957264957;4555;145
" This is the last place I would have expected to be seen , " Tyrion admitted . " I was captured by a whim . If I touch Ghost , will he chew my hand off ? ";Tyrion;Jon,;-0.05;4558;145
" Not with me here , " Jon promised .;Jon;Tyrion,;0.0;4559;145
Another year , and Tyrion had the gloomy feeling he'd be looking up at him . " What are you doing up here tonight ? ";Tyrion;Jon,;0.0;4563;145
he asked . " Besides freezing your manhood off ... ";Tyrion;Jon,;0.0;4564;145
" I have drawn night guard , " Jon said . " Again . Ser Alliser has kindly arranged for the watch commander to take a special interest in me . He seems to think that if they keep me awake half the night , I 'll fall asleep during morning drill . So far I have disappointed him . ";Jon;Alliser,;-0.114880952381;4565;145
Tyrion grinned . " And has Ghost learned to juggle yet ? ";Tyrion;Jon,;0.0;4566;145
" No , " said Jon , smiling , " but Grenn held his own against Halder this morning , and Pyp is no longer dropping his sword quite so often as he did . ";Jon;Grenn,;0.6;4567;145
" Pyp ? ";Tyrion;Jon,;0.0;4568;145
" Pypar is his real name . The small boy with the large ears . He saw me working with Grenn and asked for help . Thorne had never even shown him the proper way to grip a sword . ";Tyrion;Pyp,Alliser,;0.0160714285714;4569;145
He turned to look north . " I have a mile of Wall to guard . Will you walk with me ? ";Tyrion;Jon,;0.0;4570;145
" If you walk slowly , " Tyrion said .;Tyrion;Jon,;0.0;4571;145
" The watch commander tells me I must walk , to keep my blood from freezing , but he never said how fast . ";Tyrion;Jon,;0.2;4572;145
They walked , with Ghost pacing along beside Jon like a white shadow . " I leave on the morrow , " Tyrion said .;Tyrion;Jon,;0.0;4573;145
" I know . ";Tyrion;Jon,;0.0;4574;145
" I plan to stop at Winterfell on the way south . If there is any message that you would like me to deliver ... ";Jon;Tyrion,;0.0;4576;145
" Tell Robb that I 'm going to command the Night 's Watch and keep him safe , so he might as well take up needlework with the girls and have Mikken melt down his sword for horseshoes . ";Tyrion;Mikken,Night,;0.172222222222;4577;145
" Your brother is bigger than me , " Tyrion said with a laugh . " I decline to deliver any message that might get me killed . ";Tyrion;Jon,;0.15;4578;145
" Rickon will ask when I 'm coming home . Try to explain where I 've gone , if you can . Tell him he can have all my things while I 'm away , he 'll like that . ";Tyrion;Rickon,;0.0;4579;145
People seemed to be asking a great deal of him today , Tyrion Lannister thought . " You could put all this in a letter , you know . ";Tyrion;Jon,;0.8;4580;145
" Rickon ca n't read yet . Bran ... ";Tyrion;Rickon,;0.0;4581;145
He stopped suddenly . " I do n't know what message to send to Bran . Help him , Tyrion . ";Tyrion;Jon,;0.0;4582;145
" What help could I give him ? I am no maester , to ease his pain . I have no spells to give him back his legs . ";Tyrion;Jon,;0.0;4583;145
" You gave me help when I needed it , " Jon Snow said .;Jon;Tyrion,;0.0;4584;145
" I gave you nothing , " Tyrion said . " Words . ";Tyrion;Jon,;0.0;4585;145
" Then give your words to Bran too . ";Tyrion;Jon,;0.0;4586;145
" You 're asking a lame man to teach a cripple how to dance , " Tyrion said . " However sincere the lesson , the result is likely to be grotesque . Still , I know what it is to love a brother , Lord Snow . I will give Bran whatever small help is in my power . ";Tyrion;Bran,;-0.05;4587;145
" Thank you , my lord of Lannister . ";Tyrion;Jon,;0.0;4588;145
He pulled off his glove and offered his bare hand . " Friend . ";Tyrion;Jon,;0.05;4589;145
Tyrion found himself oddly touched . " Most of my kin are bastards , " he said with a wry smile , " but you 're the first I 've had to friend . ";Tyrion;Jon,;0.35;4590;145
" My uncle is out there , " Jon Snow said softly , leaning on his spear as he stared off into the darkness . " The first night they sent me up here , I thought , Uncle Benjen will ride back tonight , and I 'll see him first and blow the horn . He never came , though . Not that night and not any night . ";Jon;Benjen,;0.166666666667;4606;146
" Give him time , " Tyrion said .;Tyrion;Jon,;0.0;4607;146
Ghost cocked his head and listened . " If he does n't come back , " Jon Snow promised , " Ghost and I will go find him . ";Jon;Tyrion,;0.0;4610;146
" I believe you , " Tyrion said , but what he thought was , And who will go find you ?;Tyrion;Jon,;0.0;4612;146
" My lord , " Jory said when Father entered .;Jory;Stark,Arya,Sansa,Mordane,Father,;0.0;4621;147
" Be seated , " Eddard Stark said . " I see you have started without me . I am pleased to know there are still some men of sense in this city . ";Stark;Jory,Arya,Sansa,Mordane,Father,;0.15;4626;147
" The talk in the yard is we shall have a tourney , my lord , " Jory said as he resumed his seat . " They say that knights will come from all over the realm to joust and feast in honor of your appointment as Hand of the King . ";Jory;Stark,Arya,Sansa,Mordane,Father,;0.0;4629;147
Arya could see that her father was not very happy about that . " Do they also say this is the last thing in the world I would have wished ? ";Arya;Jory,Stark,Sansa,Mordane,Father,;0.5;4630;147
Sansa 's eyes had grown wide as the plates . " A tourney , " she breathed .;Sansa;Jory,Stark,Arya,Mordane,Father,;-0.1;4631;147
She was seated between Septa Mordane and Jeyne Poole , as far from Arya as she could get without drawing a reproach from Father . " Will we be permitted to go , Father ? ";Mordane;Jory,Stark,Arya,Sansa,Father,;0.1;4632;147
" You know my feelings , Sansa . It seems I must arrange Robert 's games and pretend to be honored for his sake . That does not mean I must subject my daughters to this folly . ";Arya;Robert,;-0.239583333333;4633;147
" Oh , please , " Sansa said . " I want to see . ";Sansa;Jory,Stark,Arya,Mordane,Father,;0.0;4634;147
Septa Mordane spoke up . " Princess Myrcella will be there , my lord , and her younger than Lady Sansa . All the ladies of the court will be expected at a grand event like this , and as the tourney is in your honor , it would look queer if your family did not attend . ";Mordane;Prince,;0.133333333333;4635;147
Father looked pained . " I suppose so . Very well , I shall arrange a place for you , Sansa . ";Father;Jory,Stark,Arya,Sansa,Mordane,;0.2;4636;147
He saw Arya . " For both of you . ";Arya;Jory,Stark,Sansa,Mordane,Father,;0.0;4637;147
" I do n't care about their stupid tourney , " Arya said .;Arya;Jory,Stark,Sansa,Mordane,Father,;-0.8;4638;147
Sansa lifted her head . " It will be a splendid event . You sha n't be wanted . ";Sansa;Jory,Stark,Arya,Mordane,Father,;0.833333333333;4640;147
Anger flashed across Father 's face . " Enough , Sansa . More of that and you will change my mind . I am weary unto death of this endless war you two are fighting . You are sisters . I expect you to behave like sisters , is that understood ? ";Father;Jory,Stark,Arya,Sansa,Mordane,;-0.08125;4641;147
The only sound was the clatter of knives and forks . " Pray excuse me , " her father announced to the table . " I find I have small appetite tonight . ";Arya;Jory,Stark,Sansa,Mordane,Father,;0.05;4646;147
Down the table Jory laughed at a joke , and Hullen started in about horseflesh . " Your warhorse , now , he may not be the best one for the joust . Not the same thing , oh , no , not the same at all . ";Jory;Stark,Arya,Sansa,Mordane,Father,;0.308888888889;4649;147
She wanted Jon to muss up her hair and call her " little sister " and finish her sentences with her .;Jon;Robb,;-0.1875;4659;148
Her father used to say that a lord needed to eat with his men , if he hoped to keep them . " Know the men who follow you , " she heard him tell Robb once , " and let them know you . Do n't ask your men to die for a stranger . ";Robb;Jon,;0.0;4663;148
Fat Tom used to call her " Arya Underfoot , " because he said that was where she always was .;Father;She'd,;0.0;4672;149
She'd liked that a lot better than " Arya Horseface . ";She'd;Father,;0.55;4673;149
" He was my friend , " Arya whispered into her plate , so low that no one could hear .;Arya;;0.0;4683;150
" Pray , where do you think you are going , young lady ? ";Arya;;0.1;4687;150
" I 'm not hungry . ";Arya;;0.0;4689;150
Arya found it an effort to remember her courtesies . " May I be excused , please ? ";Arya;;0.0;4690;150
" You may not , " the septa said . " You have scarcely touched your food . You will sit down and clean your plate . ";Arya;;0.105555555556;4692;150
" You clean it ! ";Arya;;0.458333333333;4693;150
He blinked when he saw Arya rushing toward him and heard the septa 's shouts . " Here now , little one , hold on , " he started to say , reaching , but Arya slid between his legs and then she was running up the winding tower steps , her feet hammering on the stone while Fat Tom huffed and puffed behind her .;Arya;;-0.29375;4696;150
Fat Tom was knocking on her door . " Arya girl , what 's wrong ? ";Father;;-0.5;4704;151
he called out . " You in there ? ";Father;;0.0;4705;151
" No ! ";Father;;0.0;4706;151
There was a pounding at her door , louder than before . " Arya Stark , you open this door at once , do you hear me ? ";Arya;;-0.1;4719;152
Arya spun around , with Needle in her hand . " You better not come in here ! ";Arya;;0.625;4720;152
" The Hand will hear of this ! ";Arya;;0.0;4723;152
" I do n't care , " Arya screamed . " Go away . ";Arya;;0.0;4725;152
" You will rue this insolent behavior , young lady , I promise you that . ";Arya;;0.1;4726;152
A soft knock at the door behind her turned Arya away from the window and her dreams of escape . " Arya , " her father 's voice called out . " Open the door . We need to talk . ";Arya;Father,Lord,Stark,lesson,Nymeria,Cities,Syrio,;-0.1;4734;153
That made Arya feel even worse . " May I come in ? ";Arya;Father,Lord,Stark,lesson,Nymeria,Cities,Syrio,;-0.4;4738;153
Father closed the door . " Whose sword is that ? ";Father;Arya,Lord,Stark,lesson,Nymeria,Cities,Syrio,;-0.1;4740;153
" Mine . ";Nymeria;Arya,Father,Lord,Stark,lesson,Cities,Syrio,;0.0;4741;153
" Give it to me . ";Arya;Father,Lord,Stark,lesson,Nymeria,Cities,Syrio,;0.0;4743;153
He tested the point with his thumb . " A bravo 's blade , " he said . " Yet it seems to me that I know this maker 's mark . This is Mikken 's work . ";Father;Mikken,;0.0;4746;153
Lord Eddard Stark sighed . " My nine-year-old daughter is being armed from my own forge , and I know nothing of it . The Hand of the King is expected to rule the Seven Kingdoms , yet it seems I cannot even rule my own household . How is it that you come to own a sword , Arya ? Where did you get this ? ";Lord;King,;0.3;4749;153
After a while , Father said , " I do n't suppose it matters , truly . ";Father;Arya,Lord,Stark,lesson,Nymeria,Cities,Syrio,;0.0;4752;153
He looked down gravely at the sword in his hands . " This is no toy for children , least of all for a girl . What would Septa Mordane say if she knew you were playing with swords ? ";Nymeria;Mordane,;-0.227777777778;4753;153
" I was n't playing , " Arya insisted . " I hate Septa Mordane . ";Arya;Mordane,;-0.8;4754;153
" That 's enough . ";Father;Arya,Lord,Stark,lesson,Nymeria,Cities,Syrio,;0.0;4755;153
Her father 's voice was curt and hard . " The septa is doing no more than is her duty , though gods know you have made it a struggle for the poor woman . Your mother and I have charged her with the impossible task of making you a lady . ";Nymeria;Arya,Father,Lord,Stark,lesson,Cities,Syrio,;-0.214583333333;4756;153
" I do n't want to be a lady ! ";Arya;Father,Lord,Stark,lesson,Nymeria,Cities,Syrio,;0.0;4757;153
" I ought to snap this toy across my knee here and now , and put an end to this nonsense . ";Father;Arya,Lord,Stark,lesson,Nymeria,Cities,Syrio,;0.0;4759;153
" Needle would n't break , " Arya said defiantly , but her voice betrayed her words .;Arya;Father,Lord,Stark,lesson,Nymeria,Cities,Syrio,;0.0;4760;153
" It has a name , does it ? ";Father;Arya,Lord,Stark,lesson,Nymeria,Cities,Syrio,;0.0;4761;153
Her father sighed . " Ah , Arya . You have a wildness in you , child . ' The wolf blood , ' my father used to call it . Lyanna had a touch of it , and my brother Brandon more than a touch . It brought them both to an early grave . ";Nymeria;Lyanna,;0.3;4762;153
Arya heard sadness in his voice ; he did not often speak of his father , or of the brother and sister who had died before she was born . " Lyanna might have carried a sword , if my lord father had allowed it . You remind me of her sometimes . You even look like her . ";Arya;Lyanna,;0.0;4763;153
" Lyanna was beautiful , " Arya said , startled .;Arya;Lyanna,;0.85;4764;153
" She was , " Eddard Stark agreed , " beautiful , and willful , and dead before her time . ";Stark;Arya,Father,Lord,lesson,Nymeria,Cities,Syrio,;0.15;4767;153
He lifted the sword , held it out between them . " Arya , what did you think to do with this ... Needle ? Who did you hope to skewer ? Your sister ? Septa Mordane ? Do you know the first thing about sword fighting ? ";Arya;Father,Lord,Stark,lesson,Nymeria,Cities,Syrio,;0.25;4768;153
All she could think of was the lesson Jon had given her . " Stick them with the pointy end , " she blurted out .;lesson;Arya,Father,Lord,Stark,Nymeria,Cities,Syrio,;0.0;4769;153
Her father snorted back laughter . " That is the essence of it , I suppose . ";Father;Arya,Lord,Stark,lesson,Nymeria,Cities,Syrio,;0.0;4770;153
Arya desperately wanted to explain , to make him see . " I was trying to learn , but ... ";Arya;Father,Lord,Stark,lesson,Nymeria,Cities,Syrio,;0.0;4771;153
Her eyes filled with tears . " I asked Mycah to practice with me . ";Father;Mycah,;0.4;4772;153
She turned away , shaking . " I asked him , " she cried . " It was my fault , it was me ... ";Arya;Father,Lord,Stark,lesson,Nymeria,Cities,Syrio,;0.0;4774;153
He held her gently as she turned to him and sobbed against his chest . " No , sweet one , " he murmured . " Grieve for your friend , but never blame yourself . You did not kill the butcher 's boy . That murder lies at the Hound 's door , him and the cruel woman he serves . ";Father;Arya,Lord,Stark,lesson,Nymeria,Cities,Syrio,;-0.325;4776;153
" I hate them , " Arya confided , red-faced , sniffling . " The Hound and the queen and the king and Prince Joffrey . I hate all of them . Joffrey lied , it was n't the way he said . I hate Sansa too . She did remember , she just lied so Joffrey would like her . ";Arya;Joffrey,Sansa,;-0.8;4777;153
" We all lie , " her father said . " Or did you truly think I'd believe that Nymeria ran off ? ";Father;I'd,;0.0;4778;153
Arya blushed guiltily . " Jory promised not to tell . ";Arya;Jory,;0.0;4779;153
" Jory kept his word , " her father said with a smile . " There are some things I do not need to be told . Even a blind man could see that wolf would never have left you willingly . ";Father;Jory,;-0.0666666666667;4780;153
" We had to throw rocks , " she said miserably . " I told her to run , to go be free , that I did n't want her anymore . There were other wolves for her to play with , we heard them howling , and Jory said the woods were full of game , so she'd have deer to hunt . Only she kept following , and finally we had to throw rocks . I hit her twice . She whined and looked at me and I felt so ' shamed , but it was right , was n't it ? The queen would have killed her . ";Nymeria;Jory,;0.0729591836735;4781;153
" It was right , " her father said . " And even the lie was ... not without honor . ";Arya;Father,Lord,Stark,lesson,Nymeria,Cities,Syrio,;0.285714285714;4782;153
He seated himself on the window seat , Needle across his lap . " Arya , sit down . I need to try and explain some things to you . ";Father;Arya,Lord,Stark,lesson,Nymeria,Cities,Syrio,;-0.155555555556;4786;153
She perched anxiously on the edge of her bed . " You are too young to be burdened with all my cares , " he told her , " but you are also a Stark of Winterfell . You know our words . ";Nymeria;Arya,Father,Lord,Stark,lesson,Cities,Syrio,;-0.05;4787;153
" Winter is coming , " Arya whispered .;Arya;Winterfell,;0.0;4788;153
" The hard cruel times , " her father said . " We tasted them on the Trident , child , and when Bran fell . You were born in the long summer , sweet one , you 've never known anything else , but now the winter is truly coming . Remember the sigil of our House , Arya . ";Father;Bran,Trident,;-0.247916666667;4789;153
" The direwolf , " she said , thinking of Nymeria .;Nymeria;Arya,Father,Lord,Stark,lesson,Cities,Syrio,;0.0;4790;153
" Let me tell you something about wolves , child . When the snows fall and the white winds blow , the lone wolf dies , but the pack survives . Summer is the time for squabbles . In winter , we must protect one another , keep each other warm , share our strengths . So if you must hate , Arya , hate those who would truly do us harm . Septa Mordane is a good woman , and Sansa ... Sansa is your sister . You may be as different as the sun and the moon , but the same blood flows through both your hearts . You need her , as she needs you ... and I need both of you , gods help me . ";Father;Summer,Mordane,;-0.059375;4792;153
He sounded so tired that it made Arya sad . " I do n't hate Sansa , " she told him . " Not truly . ";Arya;Sansa,;-0.566666666667;4793;153
" I do not mean to frighten you , but neither will I lie to you . We have come to a dark dangerous place , child . This is not Winterfell . We have enemies who mean us ill . We cannot fight a war among ourselves . This willfulness of yours , the running off , the angry words , the disobedience ... at home , these were only the summer games of a child . Here and now , with winter soon upon us , that is a different matter . It is time to begin growing up . ";Father;Arya,Lord,Stark,lesson,Nymeria,Cities,Syrio,;-0.296875;4795;153
" I will , " Arya vowed .;Arya;Father,Lord,Stark,lesson,Nymeria,Cities,Syrio,;0.0;4796;153
She had never loved him so much as she did in that instant . " I can be strong too . I can be as strong as Robb . ";Father;Arya,Lord,Stark,lesson,Nymeria,Cities,Syrio,;0.333333333333;4797;153
He held Needle out to her , hilt first . " Here . ";Arya;Father,Lord,Stark,lesson,Nymeria,Cities,Syrio,;0.25;4798;153
For a moment she was afraid to touch it , afraid that if she reached for it it would be snatched away again , but then her father said , " Go on , it 's yours , " and she took it in her hand .;Father;Arya,Lord,Stark,lesson,Nymeria,Cities,Syrio,;-0.6;4800;153
" I can keep it ? ";Arya;Father,Lord,Stark,lesson,Nymeria,Cities,Syrio,;0.0;4801;153
she said . " For true ? ";Father;Arya,Lord,Stark,lesson,Nymeria,Cities,Syrio,;0.35;4802;153
" For true . ";Arya;Father,Lord,Stark,lesson,Nymeria,Cities,Syrio,;0.35;4803;153
He smiled . " If I took it away , no doubt I'd find a morningstar hidden under your pillow within the fortnight . Try not to stab your sister , whatever the provocation . ";Father;I'd,;0.216666666667;4804;153
" I wo n't . I promise . ";Arya;Father,Lord,Stark,lesson,Nymeria,Cities,Syrio,;0.0;4805;153
The hall seemed empty , until an unfamiliar voice said , " You are late , boy . ";Father;Arya,Lord,Stark,lesson,Nymeria,Cities,Syrio,;-0.2;4811;153
A slight man with a bald head and a great beak of a nose stepped out of the shadows , holding a pair of slender wooden swords . " Tomorrow you will be here at midday , " He had an accent , the lilt of the Free Cities , Braavos perhaps , or Myr .;Cities;Arya,Father,Lord,Stark,lesson,Nymeria,Syrio,;0.258333333333;4812;153
" Who are you ? ";Father;Arya,Lord,Stark,lesson,Nymeria,Cities,Syrio,;0.0;4813;153
" I am your dancing master . ";Arya;Father,Lord,Stark,lesson,Nymeria,Cities,Syrio,;0.0;4815;153
She grabbed for it , missed , and heard it clatter to the floor . " Tomorrow you will catch it . Now pick it up . ";Father;Arya,Lord,Stark,lesson,Nymeria,Cities,Syrio,;0.0;4817;153
The bald man clicked his teeth together . " That is not the way , boy . This is not a greatsword that is needing two hands to swing it . You will take the blade in one hand . ";Nymeria;Arya,Father,Lord,Stark,lesson,Cities,Syrio,;0.0;4821;153
" It 's too heavy , " Arya said .;Arya;Father,Lord,Stark,lesson,Nymeria,Cities,Syrio,;-0.2;4822;153
" It is heavy as it needs to be to make you strong , and for the balancing . A hollow inside is filled with lead , just so . One hand now is all that is needing . ";Father;Arya,Lord,Stark,lesson,Nymeria,Cities,Syrio,;0.211111111111;4823;153
He seemed to approve . " The left is good . All is reversed , it will make your enemies more awkward . Now you are standing wrong . Turn your body sideface , yes , so . You are skinny as the shaft of a spear , do you know . That is good too , the target is smaller . Now the grip . Let me see . ";Arya;Father,Lord,Stark,lesson,Nymeria,Cities,Syrio,;0.1;4826;153
He moved closer and peered at her hand , prying her fingers apart , rearranging them . " Just so , yes . Do not squeeze it so tight , no , the grip must be deft , delicate . ";Father;Arya,Lord,Stark,lesson,Nymeria,Cities,Syrio,;0.0404761904762;4827;153
" What if I drop it ? ";Arya;Father,Lord,Stark,lesson,Nymeria,Cities,Syrio,;0.0;4828;153
" The steel must be part of your arm , " the bald man told her . " Can you drop part of your arm ? No . Nine years Syrio Forel was first sword to the Sealord of Braavos , he knows these things . Listen to him , boy . ";Father;Syrio,;0.25;4830;153
It was the third time he had called her " boy . " " I 'm a girl , " Arya objected .;Arya;Father,Lord,Stark,lesson,Nymeria,Cities,Syrio,;0.0;4831;153
" Boy , girl , " Syrio Forel said . " You are a sword , that is all . ";Syrio;Arya,Father,Lord,Stark,lesson,Nymeria,Cities,;0.0;4832;153
He clicked his teeth together . " Just so , that is the grip . You are not holding a battle-axe , you are holding a - ";Father;Arya,Lord,Stark,lesson,Nymeria,Cities,Syrio,;0.0;4833;153
" - needle , " Arya finished for him , fiercely .;Arya;Father,Lord,Stark,lesson,Nymeria,Cities,Syrio,;0.0;4834;153
" Just so . Now we will begin the dance . Remember , child , this is not the iron dance of Westeros we are learning , the knight 's dance , hacking and hammering , no . This is the bravo 's dance , the water dance , swift and sudden . All men are made of water , do you know this ? When you pierce them , the water leaks out and they die . ";Father;Arya,Lord,Stark,lesson,Nymeria,Cities,Syrio,;0.0;4835;153
He took a step backward , raised his own wooden blade . " Now you will try to strike me . ";Arya;Father,Lord,Stark,lesson,Nymeria,Cities,Syrio,;0.3;4836;153
" The Dothraki sea , " Ser Jorah Mormont said as he reined to a halt beside her on the top of the ridge .;Jorah;;0.5;4843;154
Past here , there were no hills , no mountains , no trees nor cities nor roads , only the endless grasses , the tall blades rippling like waves when the winds blew . " It 's so green , " she said .;Jorah;;-0.14375;4846;154
" Here and now , " Ser Jorah agreed . " You ought to see it when it blooms , all dark red flowers from horizon to horizon , like a sea of blood . Come the dry season , and the world turns the color of old bronze . And this is only hranna , child . There are a hundred kinds of grass out there , grasses as yellow as lemon and as dark as indigo , blue grasses and orange grasses and grasses like rainbows . Down in the Shadow Lands beyond Asshai , they say there are oceans of ghost grass , taller than a man on horseback with stalks as pale as milkglass . It murders all other grass and glows in the dark with the spirits of the damned . The Dothraki claim that someday ghost grass will cover the entire world , and then all life will end . ";Jorah;;-0.0581018518519;4847;154
That thought gave Dany the shivers . " I do n't want to talk about that now , " she said . " It 's so beautiful here , I do n't want to think about everything dying . ";Jorah;;0.85;4848;154
" As you will , Khaleesi , " Ser Jorah said respectfully .;Jorah;;0.0;4849;154
He would stay with Drogo until the debt had been paid , until he had the crown he had been promised . " And if he tries to cheat me , he will learn to his sorrow what it means to wake the dragon , " Viserys had vowed , laying a hand on his borrowed sword .;Viserys;;-0.1;4856;155
" Wait here , " Dany told Ser Jorah . " Tell them all to stay . Tell them I command it . ";Dany;;0.0;4863;156
Yet his smiles gave Dany comfort . " You are learning to talk like a queen , Daenerys . ";Dany;;0.0;4867;156
" Not a queen , " said Dany . " A khaleesi . ";Dany;;0.0;4868;156
Even her handmaids noticed the change . " Khaleesi , " Jhiqui said , " what is wrong ? Are you sick ? ";Jhiqui;Illyrio,;-0.607142857143;4898;157
" I was , " she answered , standing over the dragon 's eggs that Illyrio had given her when she wed .;Illyrio;Jhiqui,;0.0;4899;157
Viserys came upon her as sudden as a summer storm , his horse rearing beneath him as he reined up too hard . " You dare ! ";Viserys;Dany,;-0.182291666667;4936;158
he screamed at her . " You give commands to me ? To me ? ";Viserys;Dany,;0.0;4937;158
He grabbed her , shook her . " Have you forgotten who you are ? Look at you . Look at you ! ";Dany;Viserys,;0.0;4940;158
He was still screaming . " You do not command the dragon . Do you understand ? I am the Lord of the Seven Kingdoms , I will not hear orders from some horselord 's slut , do you hear me ? ";Viserys;Lord,;0.0;4945;158
His hand went under her vest , his fingers digging painfully into her breast . " Do you hear me ? ";Dany;Viserys,;0.0;4946;158
Dany did not understand his words , but by then Irri was there , and Ser Jorah , and the rest of her khas . " Jhogo asks if you would have him dead , Khaleesi , " Irri said .;Dany;Jhogo,;-0.2;4959;159
" No , " Dany replied . " No . ";Dany;Irri,Jorah,Dothraki,;0.0;4960;159
Irri told her , " Quaro thinks you should take an ear to teach him respect . ";Irri;Quaro,;0.0;4963;159
" Tell them I do not wish him harmed , " Dany said .;Dany;Irri,Jorah,Dothraki,;0.0;4966;159
" I warned him what would happen , my lady , " Ser Jorah Mormont said . " I told him to stay on the ridge , as you commanded . ";Jorah;Dany,Irri,Dothraki,;0.0;4970;159
" I know you did , " Dany replied , watching Viserys .;Dany;Irri,Jorah,Dothraki,;0.0;4971;159
" Take his horse , " Dany commanded Ser Jorah .;Dany;Irri,Jorah,Dothraki,;0.0;4977;159
Yet the words came . " Let my brother walk behind us back to the khalasar . ";Jorah;Dany,Irri,Dothraki,;-0.2;4980;159
Among the Dothraki , the man who does not ride was no man at all , the lowest of the low , without honor or pride . " Let everyone see him as he is . ";Dothraki;Dany,Irri,Jorah,;0.0;4981;159
" No ! ";Dany;Irri,Jorah,Dothraki,;0.0;4982;159
He turned to Ser Jorah , pleading in the Common Tongue with words the horsemen would not understand . " Hit her , Mormont . Hurt her . Your king commands it . Kill these Dothraki dogs and teach her . ";Jorah;Dany,Irri,Dothraki,;-0.3;4984;159
Dany could see the decision on his face . " He shall walk , Khaleesi , " he said .;Dany;Irri,Jorah,Dothraki,;0.0;4986;159
When they could not see him anymore , Dany grew afraid . " Will he find his way back ? ";Dany;Irri,Jorah,Dothraki,;-0.3;4991;159
" Even a man as blind as your brother should be able to follow our trail , " he replied .;Jorah;Dany,Irri,Dothraki,;0.0;4993;159
" He is proud . He may be too shamed to come back . ";Dany;Irri,Jorah,Dothraki,;0.4;4994;159
Jorah laughed . " Where else should he go ? If he cannot find the khalasar , the khalasar will most surely find him . It is hard to drown in the Dothraki sea , child . ";Jorah;Dany,Irri,Dothraki,;0.302777777778;4995;159
" I hit him , " she said , wonder in her voice .;Dany;Jorah,;0.0;5002;160
Now that it was over , it seemed like some strange dream that she had dreamed . " Ser Jorah , do you think ... he 'll be so angry when he gets back ... ";Dany;Jorah,;-0.183333333333;5003;160
She shivered . " I woke the dragon , did n't I ? ";Dany;Jorah,;0.0;5004;160
Ser Jorah snorted . " Can you wake the dead , girl ? Your brother Rhaegar was the last dragon , and he died on the Trident . Viserys is less than the shadow of a snake . ";Jorah;Rhaegar,Viserys,;-0.122222222222;5005;160
It seemed as though all the things she had always believed were suddenly called into question . " You ... you swore him your sword ... ";Dany;Jorah,;0.0;5007;160
" That I did , girl , " Ser Jorah said . " And if your brother is the shadow of a snake , what does that make his servants ? ";Jorah;Dany,;0.0;5008;160
" He is still the true king . He is ... ";Dany;Jorah,;0.35;5010;160
Jorah pulled up his horse and looked at her . " Truth now . Would you want to see Viserys sit a throne ? ";Jorah;Viserys,;0.0;5011;160
Dany thought about that . " He would not be a very good king , would he ? ";Dany;Jorah,;0.845;5012;160
" There have been worse ... but not many . ";Dany;Jorah,;0.05;5013;160
Dany rode close beside him . " Still , " she said , " the common people are waiting for him . Magister Illyrio says they are sewing dragon banners and praying for Viserys to return from across the narrow sea to free them . ";Dany;Illyrio,;-0.0333333333333;5015;160
" The common people pray for rain , healthy children , and a summer that never ends , " Ser Jorah told her . " It is no matter to them if the high lords play their game of thrones , so long as they are left in peace . ";Jorah;Dany,;-0.015;5016;160
He gave a shrug . " They never are . ";Dany;Jorah,;0.0;5017;160
" What do you pray for , Ser Jorah ? ";Jorah;Dany,;0.0;5021;160
" Home , " he said .;Dany;Jorah,;0.0;5023;160
" I pray for home too , " she told him , believing it .;Dany;Jorah,;0.0;5025;160
Ser Jorah laughed . " Look around you then , Khaleesi . ";Jorah;Dany,;0.7;5026;160
" My brother will never take back the Seven Kingdoms , " Dany said .;Dany;Jorah,;0.0;5032;160
Ser Jorah gave her a measuring look . " You think not . ";Jorah;Dany,;0.0;5036;160
" He could not lead an army even if my lord husband gave him one , " Dany said . " He has no coin and the only knight who follows him reviles him as less than a snake . The Dothraki make mock of his weakness . He will never take us home . ";Dany;Jorah,;-0.0833333333333;5037;160
" Wise child . ";Dany;Jorah,;0.7;5038;160
" I am no child , " she told him fiercely .;Jorah;Dany,;0.0;5040;160
Almost hot . " The sun , " Dany whispered . " The sun warmed them as they rode . ";Dany;Irri,Jhiqui,Doreah,Dothraki,;0.25;5058;161
" Have you ever seen a dragon ? ";Jhiqui;Dany,Irri,Doreah,Dothraki,;0.0;5062;161
" Dragons are gone , Khaleesi , " Irri said .;Irri;Dragonstone,;0.0;5066;161
" Dead , " agreed Jhiqui . " Long and long ago . ";Jhiqui;Dany,Irri,Doreah,Dothraki,;-0.1;5067;161
That did not seem so long ago to Dany . " Everywhere ? ";Dany;Irri,Jhiqui,Doreah,Dothraki,;-0.05;5069;161
she said , disappointed . " Even in the east ? ";Jhiqui;Dany,Irri,Doreah,Dothraki,;-0.75;5070;161
" No dragon , " Irri said . " Brave men kill them , for dragon terrible evil beasts . It is known . ";Irri;Dany,Jhiqui,Doreah,Dothraki,;-0.4;5074;161
" It is known , " agreed Jhiqui .;Jhiqui;Dany,Irri,Doreah,Dothraki,;0.0;5075;161
" A trader from Qarth once told me that dragons came from the moon , " blond Doreah said as she warmed a towel over the fire .;Doreah;once,;0.0;5076;161
Silvery-wet hair tumbled across her eyes as Dany turned her head , curious . " The moon ? ";Dany;Irri,Jhiqui,Doreah,Dothraki,;-0.1;5080;161
" He told me the moon was an egg , Khaleesi , " the Lysene girl said . " Once there were two moons in the sky , but one wandered too close to the sun and cracked from the heat . A thousand thousand dragons poured forth , and drank the fire of the sun . That is why dragons breathe flame . One day the other moon will kiss the sun too , and then it will crack and the dragons will return . ";Jhiqui;Dany,Irri,Doreah,Dothraki,;-0.125;5081;161
The two Dothraki girls giggled and laughed . " You are foolish strawhead slave , " Irri said . " Moon is no egg . Moon is god , woman wife of sun . It is known . ";Irri;Moon,;0.7;5082;161
" It is known , " Jhiqui agreed .;Jhiqui;Dany,Irri,Doreah,Dothraki,;0.0;5083;161
Her supper was a simple meal of fruit and cheese and fry bread , with a jug of honeyed wine to wash it down . " Doreah , stay and eat with me , " Dany commanded when she sent her other handmaids away .;Dany;Irri,Jhiqui,Doreah,Dothraki,;-0.0935185185185;5088;161
She lowered those eyes when they were alone . " You honor me , Khaleesi , " she said , but it was no honor , only service .;Jhiqui;Dany,Irri,Doreah,Dothraki,;0.0;5090;161
She rose slowly and opened her sleeping silks and let them fall to the ground . " This night we must go outside , my lord , " she told him , for the Dothraki believed that all things of importance in a man 's life must be done beneath the open sky .;Dothraki;Dany,Irri,Jhiqui,Doreah,;0.2;5094;161
When he tried to turn her over , she put a hand on his chest . " No , " she said . " This night I would look on your face . ";Dany;Irri,Jhiqui,Doreah,Dothraki,;0.0;5097;161
They were on the far side of the Dothraki sea when Jhiqui brushed the soft swell of Dany 's stomach with her fingers and said , " Khaleesi , you are with child . ";Jhiqui;Dany,;0.0666666666667;5104;162
" I know , " Dany told her .;Dany;Jhiqui,;0.0;5105;162
" It was just a lie , " he said bitterly , remembering the crow from his dream . " I ca n't fly . I ca n't even run . ";Nan;Bran,;0.8;5125;163
" Crows are all liars , " Old Nan agreed , from the chair where she sat doing her needlework . " I know a story about a crow . ";Nan;Crows,;0.1;5126;163
" I do n't want any more stories , " Bran snapped , his voice petulant .;Bran;Nan,;0.5;5127;163
They left her with him all day now , to watch over him and clean him and keep him from being lonely , but she just made it worse . " I hate your stupid stories . ";Nan;Bran,;-0.288888888889;5131;163
The old woman smiled at him toothlessly . " My stories ? No , my little lord , not mine . The stories are , before me and after me , before you too . ";Bran;Nan,;0.170833333333;5132;163
" I do n't care whose stories they are , " Bran told her , " I hate them . ";Bran;;-0.8;5143;164
" I know a story about a boy who hated stories , " Old Nan said with her stupid little smile , her needles moving all the while , click click click , until Bran was ready to scream at her .;Nan;Maester,;-0.214583333333;5150;165
Maester Luwin had sent a bird after Lord Eddard with a message , and another to Mother and a third to Jon on the Wall , but there had been no answers . " Ofttimes the birds are lost , child , " the maester had told him . " There 's many a mile and many a hawk between here and King 's Landing , the message may not have reached them . ";Maester;Nan,;0.333333333333;5155;165
" I could tell you the story about Brandon the Builder , " Old Nan said . " That was always your favorite . ";Nan;Bran,Hodor,Maester,;0.3;5167;166
" That 's not my favorite , " he said . " My favorites were the scary ones . ";Bran;Nan,Hodor,Maester,;0.0;5173;166
" Oh , my sweet summer child , " Old Nan said quietly , " what do you know of fear ? Fear is for the winter , my little lord , when the snows fall a hundred feet deep and the ice wind comes howling out of the north . Fear is for the long night , when the sun hides its face for years at a time , and little children are born and live and die all in darkness while the direwolves grow gaunt and hungry , and the white walkers move through the woods . ";Nan;Bran,Hodor,Maester,;0.0201704545455;5177;166
" You mean the Others , " Bran said querulously .;Bran;Nan,Hodor,Maester,;-0.3125;5178;166
" The Others , " Old Nan agreed . " Thousands and thousands of years ago , a winter fell that was cold and hard and endless beyond all memory of man . There came a night that lasted a generation , and kings shivered and died in their castles even as the swineherds in their hovels . Women smothered their children rather than see them starve , and cried , and felt their tears freeze on their cheeks . ";Nan;Women,;-0.229166666667;5179;166
Her voice and her needles fell silent , and she glanced up at Bran with pale , filmy eyes and asked , " So , child . This is the sort of story you like ? ";Bran;Nan,Hodor,Maester,;0.0;5180;166
" Well , " Bran said reluctantly , " yes , only ... ";Bran;Nan,Hodor,Maester,;0.0;5181;166
Old Nan nodded . " In that darkness , the Others came for the first time , " she said as her needles went click click click . " They were cold things , dead things , that hated iron and fire and the touch of the sun , and every creature with hot blood in its veins . They swept over holdfasts and cities and kingdoms , felled heroes and armies by the score , riding their pale dead horses and leading hosts of the slain . All the swords of men could not stay their advance , and even maidens and suckling babes found no pity in them . They hunted the maids through frozen forests , and fed their dead servants on the flesh of human children . ";Nan;Bran,Hodor,Maester,;-0.166666666667;5182;166
" Now these were the days before the Andals came , and long before the women fled across the narrow sea from the cities of the Rhoyne , and the hundred kingdoms of those times were the kingdoms of the First Men , who had taken these lands from the children of the forest . Yet here and there in the fastness of the woods the children still lived in their wooden cities and hollow hills , and the faces in the trees kept watch . So as cold and death filled the earth , the last hero determined to seek out the children , in the hopes that their ancient magics could win back what the armies of men had lost . He set out into the dead lands with a sword , a horse , a dog , and a dozen companions . For years he searched , until he despaired of ever finding the children of the forest in their secret cities . One by one his friends died , and his horse , and finally even his dog , and his sword froze so hard the blade snapped when he tried to use it . And the Others smelled the hot blood in him , and came silent on his trail , stalking him with packs of pale white spiders big as hounds - ";Bran;Andals,earth,;-0.00260416666667;5184;166
The door opened with a bang , and Bran 's heart leapt up into his mouth in sudden fear , but it was only Maester Luwin , with Hodor looming in the stairway behind him . " Hodor ! ";Hodor;Nan,Bran,Maester,;-0.166666666667;5185;166
Maester Luwin was not smiling . " We have visitors , " he announced , " and your presence is required , Bran . ";Maester;Nan,Bran,Hodor,;0.0;5187;166
" I 'm listening to a story now , " Bran complained .;Bran;Nan,Hodor,Maester,;-0.3;5188;166
" Stories wait , my little lord , and when you come back to them , why , there they are , " Old Nan said . " Visitors are not so patient , and ofttimes they bring stories of their own . ";Nan;Stories,;0.128125;5189;166
" Who is it ? ";Maester;Nan,Bran,Hodor,;0.0;5190;166
" Tyrion Lannister , and some men of the Night 's Watch , with word from your brother Jon . Robb is meeting with them now . Hodor , will you help Bran down to the hall ? ";Bran;Robb,Bran,;-0.155555555556;5192;166
" Hodor ! ";Nan;Bran,Hodor,Maester,;0.0;5193;166
His arms were thick with muscle and matted with brown hair . " Hodor , " he said again .;Greyjoy;;-0.3;5202;167
No one knew where " Hodor " had come from , she said , but when he started saying it , they started calling him by it .;Greyjoy;;0.0;5205;167
" Any man of the Night 's Watch is welcome here at Winterfell for as long as he wishes to stay , " Robb was saying with the voice of Robb the Lord .;Robb;Bran,Hodor,Maester,Tyrion,Lannister,Greyjoy,;0.375;5214;168
" Any man of the Night 's Watch , " the dwarf repeated , " but not me , do I take your meaning , boy ? ";Bran;Robb,Hodor,Maester,Tyrion,Lannister,Greyjoy,;0.0;5217;168
Robb stood and pointed at the little man with his sword . " I am the lord here while my mother and father are away , Lannister . I am not your boy . ";Robb;Bran,Hodor,Maester,Tyrion,Lannister,Greyjoy,;-0.1875;5218;168
" If you are a lord , you might learn a lord 's courtesy , " the little man replied , ignoring the sword point in his face . " Your bastard brother has all your father 's graces , it would seem . ";Maester;Robb,Bran,Hodor,Tyrion,Lannister,Greyjoy,;-0.1875;5219;168
" Jon , " Bran gasped out from Hodor 's arms .;Bran;Robb,Hodor,Maester,Tyrion,Lannister,Greyjoy,;0.0;5220;168
The dwarf turned to look at him . " So it is true , the boy lives . I could scarce believe it . You Starks are hard to kill . ";Maester;Stark,;0.0291666666667;5221;168
" You Lannisters had best remember that , " Robb said , lowering his sword . " Hodor , bring my brother here . ";Robb;Lannister,;1.0;5222;168
" Hodor , " Hodor said , and he trotted forward smiling and set Bran in the high seat of the Starks , where the Lords of Winterfell had sat since the days when they called themselves the Kings in the North .;Hodor;Robb,Bran,Maester,Tyrion,Lannister,Greyjoy,;0.16;5223;168
Robb put a hand on his shoulder . " You said you had business with Bran . Well , here he is , Lannister . ";Robb;Bran,Hodor,Maester,Tyrion,Lannister,Greyjoy,;0.0;5227;168
One was black and one was green , and both were looking at him , studying him , weighing him . " I am told you were quite the climber , Bran , " the little man said at last . " Tell me , how is it you happened to fall that day ? ";Maester;Robb,Bran,Hodor,Tyrion,Lannister,Greyjoy,;-0.138541666667;5229;168
" I never , " Bran insisted .;Bran;Robb,Hodor,Maester,Tyrion,Lannister,Greyjoy,;0.0;5230;168
" The child does not remember anything of the fall , or the climb that came before it , " said Maester Luwin gently .;Maester;Robb,Bran,Hodor,Tyrion,Lannister,Greyjoy,;0.0;5232;168
" Curious , " said Tyrion Lannister .;Tyrion;Robb,Bran,Hodor,Maester,Lannister,Greyjoy,;-0.1;5233;168
" My brother is not here to answer questions , Lannister , " Robb said curtly . " Do your business and be on your way . ";Robb;Bran,Hodor,Maester,Tyrion,Lannister,Greyjoy,;0.0;5234;168
" I have a gift for you , " the dwarf said to Bran . " Do you like to ride , boy ? ";Bran;Robb,Hodor,Maester,Tyrion,Lannister,Greyjoy,;0.0;5235;168
Maester Luwin came forward . " My lord , the child has lost the use of his legs . He cannot sit a horse . ";Maester;Robb,Bran,Hodor,Tyrion,Lannister,Greyjoy,;0.0;5236;168
" Nonsense , " said Lannister . " With the right horse and the right saddle , even a cripple can ride . ";Lannister;Robb,Bran,Hodor,Maester,Tyrion,Greyjoy,;0.285714285714;5237;168
He felt tears come unbidden to his eyes . " I 'm not a cripple ! ";Robb;Bran,Hodor,Maester,Tyrion,Lannister,Greyjoy,;0.0;5239;168
" Then I am not a dwarf , " the dwarf said with a twist of his mouth . " My father will rejoice to hear it . ";Greyjoy;Robb,Bran,Hodor,Maester,Tyrion,Lannister,;0.0;5240;168
" What sort of horse and saddle are you suggesting ? ";Robb;Bran,Hodor,Maester,Tyrion,Lannister,Greyjoy,;0.0;5242;168
" A smart horse , " Lannister replied . " The boy cannot use his legs to command the animal , so you must shape the horse to the rider , teach it to respond to the reins , to the voice . I would begin with an unbroken yearling , with no old training to be unlearned , " He drew a rolled paper from his belt . " Give this to your saddler . He will provide the rest . ";Lannister;Robb,Bran,Hodor,Maester,Tyrion,Greyjoy,;0.157142857143;5244;168
He unrolled it , studied it . " I see . You draw nicely , my lord . Yes , this ought to work . I should have thought of this myself . ";Robb;Bran,Hodor,Maester,Tyrion,Lannister,Greyjoy,;0.0;5246;168
" It came easier to me , Maester . It is not terribly unlike my own saddles . ";Maester;Robb,Bran,Hodor,Tyrion,Lannister,Greyjoy,;0.6;5247;168
" Will I truly be able to ride ? ";Bran;Robb,Hodor,Maester,Tyrion,Lannister,Greyjoy,;0.5;5248;168
" You will , " the dwarf told him . " And I swear to you , boy , on horseback you will be as tall as any of them . ";Maester;Robb,Bran,Hodor,Tyrion,Lannister,Greyjoy,;0.0;5253;168
Robb Stark seemed puzzled . " Is this some trap , Lannister ? What 's Bran to you ? Why should you want to help him ? ";Robb;Bran,;-0.2;5254;168
" Your brother Jon asked it of me . And I have a tender spot in my heart for cripples and bastards and broken things . ";Bran;brother,;-0.4;5255;168
" The wolves do not like your smell , Lannister , " Theon Greyjoy commented .;Greyjoy;Tyrion,Bran,Robb,Lannister,Maester,finally,Hodor,;0.0;5265;169
" Perhaps it 's time I took my leave , " Tyrion said .;Tyrion;Greyjoy,Bran,Robb,Lannister,Maester,finally,Hodor,;0.0;5266;169
" No ! ";Robb;Greyjoy,Tyrion,Bran,Lannister,Maester,finally,Hodor,;0.0;5271;169
Bran shouted from the high seat as Lannister 's men reached for their steel . " Summer , here . Summer , to me ! ";Bran;Greyjoy,Tyrion,Robb,Lannister,Maester,finally,Hodor,;0.2;5272;169
He let it out with a sigh and called , " Grey Wind . ";Robb;Greyjoy,Tyrion,Bran,Lannister,Maester,finally,Hodor,;-0.05;5276;169
" Rickon , call him , " Bran shouted to his baby brother , and Rickon remembered himself and screamed , " Home , Shaggy , home now . ";Bran;Greyjoy,Tyrion,Robb,Lannister,Maester,finally,Hodor,;0.0;5279;169
Tyrion Lannister undid his scarf , mopped at his brow , and said in a flat voice , " How interesting . ";Tyrion;Greyjoy,Bran,Robb,Lannister,Maester,finally,Hodor,;0.2375;5281;169
" Are you well , my lord ? ";Robb;Greyjoy,Tyrion,Bran,Lannister,Maester,finally,Hodor,;0.0;5282;169
" My sleeve is torn and my breeches are unaccountably damp , but nothing was harmed save my dignity . ";Bran;Greyjoy,Tyrion,Robb,Lannister,Maester,finally,Hodor,;0.0;5285;169
Even Robb looked shaken . " The wolves ... I do n't know why they did that ... ";Robb;Greyjoy,Tyrion,Bran,Lannister,Maester,finally,Hodor,;0.0;5286;169
" No doubt they mistook me for dinner . ";Bran;Greyjoy,Tyrion,Robb,Lannister,Maester,finally,Hodor,;0.0;5287;169
Lannister bowed stiffly to Bran . " I thank you for calling them off , young ser . I promise you , they would have found me quite indigestible . And now I will be leaving , truly . ";Lannister;Greyjoy,Tyrion,Bran,Robb,Maester,finally,Hodor,;0.1;5288;169
" A moment , my lord , " Maester Luwin said .;Maester;Greyjoy,Tyrion,Bran,Robb,Lannister,finally,Hodor,;0.0;5289;169
Robb Stark finally sheathed his sword . " I ... I may have been hasty with you , " he said . " You 've done Bran a kindness , and , well ... ";finally;Greyjoy,Tyrion,Bran,Robb,Lannister,Maester,Hodor,;-0.2;5292;169
Robb composed himself with an effort . " The hospitality of Winterfell is yours if you wish it , Lannister . ";Robb;Winterfell,;0.0;5293;169
" Spare me your false courtesies , boy . You do not love me and you do not want me here . I saw an inn outside your walls , in the winter town . I 'll find a bed there , and both of us will sleep easier . For a few coppers I may even find a comely wench to warm the sheets for me . ";Bran;Greyjoy,Tyrion,Robb,Lannister,Maester,finally,Hodor,;0.1;5294;169
He spoke to one of the black brothers , an old man with a twisted back and a tangled beard . " Yoren , we go south at daybreak . You will find me on the road , no doubt . ";Tyrion;Greyjoy,Bran,Robb,Lannister,Maester,finally,Hodor,;-0.141666666667;5295;169
Robb turned to them uncertainly . " I have had rooms prepared , and you 'll find no lack of hot water to wash off the dust of the road . I hope you will honor us at table tonight , " He spoke the words so awkwardly that even Bran took note ; it was a speech he had learned , not words from the heart , but the black brothers thanked him all the same .;Robb;Greyjoy,Tyrion,Bran,Lannister,Maester,finally,Hodor,;0.0277777777778;5299;169
Hodor said " Hodor , " gathered up his great-grandmother , and carried her off , snoring softly , while Bran lay thinking .;Hodor;Greyjoy,Tyrion,Bran,Robb,Lannister,Maester,finally,;0.0;5302;169
Robb had promised that he could feast with the Night 's Watch in the Great Hall . " Summer , " he called .;Robb;Greyjoy,Tyrion,Bran,Lannister,Maester,finally,Hodor,;0.8;5303;169
Bran hugged him so hard he could feel the hot breath on his cheek . " I can ride now , " he whispered to his friend . " We can go hunting in the woods soon , wait and see . ";Bran;Greyjoy,Tyrion,Robb,Lannister,Maester,finally,Hodor,;-0.0208333333333;5305;169
But when the gargoyles pulled themselves loose from the stone and padded down the side of the tower to where Bran clung , he knew he was not safe after all . " I did n't hear , " he wept as they came closer and closer , " I did n't , I did n't . ";Bran;;0.0891737891738;5323;170
He woke gasping , lost in darkness , and saw a vast shadow looming over him . " I did n't hear , " he whispered , trembling in fear , but then the shadow said " Hodor , " and lit the candle by the bedside , and Bran sighed with relief .;Bran;;0.0;5324;170
He ripped at the meat with his teeth , cracked the ribs to suck out the marrow from the bones , and shrugged at the mention of Jon Snow . " Ser Alliser 's bane , " he grunted , and two of his companions shared a laugh that Bran did not understand .;Bran;Yoren,Robb,Old,Greyjoy,;0.3;5334;171
" What is it ? ";Robb;Bran,Yoren,Old,Greyjoy,;0.0;5336;171
Yoren wiped his fingers on his vest . " There 's hard news , m'lords , and a cruel way to pay you for your meat and mead , but the man as asks the question must bear the answer . Stark 's gone . ";Yoren;Bran,Robb,Old,Greyjoy,;-0.497222222222;5338;171
One of the other men said , " The Old Bear sent him out to look for Waymar Royce , and he 's late returning , my lord . ";Bran;Old,;-0.108333333333;5339;171
" Too long , " Yoren said . " Most like he 's dead . ";Yoren;Bran,Robb,Old,Greyjoy,;0.0833333333333;5340;171
" My uncle is not dead , " Robb Stark said loudly , anger in his tones .;Robb;Bran,Yoren,Old,Greyjoy,;-0.366666666667;5341;171
He rose from the bench and laid his hand on the hilt of his sword . " Do you hear me ? My uncle is not dead ! ";Bran;Yoren,Robb,Old,Greyjoy,;0.25;5342;171
Old sour-smelling Yoren looked up at Robb , unimpressed . " Whatever you say , m'lord , " he said .;Old;Bran,Yoren,Robb,Greyjoy,;0.1;5344;171
The youngest of the black brothers shifted uncomfortably in his seat . " There 's not a man on the Wall knows the haunted forest better than Benjen Stark . He 'll find his way back . ";Bran;King,;0.0333333333333;5346;171
" Well , " said Yoren , " maybe he will and maybe he wo n't . Good men have gone into those woods before , and never come out . ";Yoren;Bran,Robb,Old,Greyjoy,;0.65;5347;171
He was afraid for a moment , until he remembered how that story ended . " The children will help him , " he blurted , " the children of the forest ! ";Bran;Yoren,Robb,Old,Greyjoy,;-0.75;5349;171
Theon Greyjoy sniggered , and Maester Luwin said , " Bran , the children of the forest have been dead and gone for thousands of years . All that is left of them are the faces in the trees . ";Greyjoy;Bran,Yoren,Robb,Old,;-0.1;5350;171
" Down here , might be that 's true , Maester , " Yoren said , " but up past the Wall , who 's to say ? Up there , a man ca n't always tell what 's alive and what 's dead . ";Yoren;King,;-0.0311111111111;5351;171
Bran wanted to talk to him , but he did not know what to say . " We 'll find a horse for you , I promise , " Robb whispered at last .;Bran;Yoren,Robb,Old,Greyjoy,;0.0;5357;171
" Are they ever coming back ? ";Yoren;Bran,Robb,Old,Greyjoy,;0.0;5358;171
" Yes , " Robb said with such hope in his voice that Bran knew he was hearing his brother and not just Robb the Lord . " Mother will be home soon . Maybe we can ride out to meet her when she comes . Would n't that surprise her , to see you ahorse ? ";Robb;Mother,;0.0;5360;171
Even in the dark room , Bran could feel his brother 's smile . " And afterward , we 'll ride north to see the Wall . We wo n't even tell Jon we 're coming , we 'll just be there one day , you and me . It will be an adventure . ";Bran;King,;0.075;5361;171
" An adventure , " Bran repeated wistfully .;Bran;Yoren,Robb,Old,Greyjoy,;0.0;5362;171
" Lord Arryn 's death was a great sadness for all of us , my lord , " Grand Maester Pycelle said . " I would be more than happy to tell you what I can of the manner of his passing . Do be seated . Would you care for refreshments ? Some dates , perhaps ? I have some very fine persimmons as well . Wine no longer agrees with my digestion , I fear , but I can offer you a cup of iced milk , sweetened with honey . I find it most refreshing in this heat . ";Maester;Wine,;0.591666666667;5369;172
Thick , moist air covered the city like a damp woolen blanket , and the riverside had grown unruly as the poor fled their hot , airless warrens to jostle for sleeping places near the water , where the only breath of wind was to be found . " That would be most kind , " Ned said , seating himself .;Ned;Maester,Pycelle,Arya,Sansa,Alyn,Littlefinger,Stark,Lord,Petyr,;0.107142857143;5371;172
A slender young serving girl hurried into the solar . " Iced milk for the King 's Hand and myself , if you would be so kind , child . Well sweetened . ";Pycelle;Maester,Ned,Arya,Sansa,Alyn,Littlefinger,Stark,Lord,Petyr,;0.35;5373;172
As the girl went to fetch their drinks , the Grand Maester knotted his fingers together and rested his hands on his stomach . " The smallfolk say that the last year of summer is always the hottest . It is not so , yet ofttimes it feels that way , does it not ? On days like this , I envy you northerners your summer snows . ";Maester;Ned,Pycelle,Arya,Sansa,Alyn,Littlefinger,Stark,Lord,Petyr,;0.25;5374;172
The heavy jeweled chain around the old man 's neck chinked softly as he shifted in his seat . " To be sure , King Maekar 's summer was hotter than this one , and near as long . There were fools , even in the Citadel , who took that to mean that the Great Summer had come at last , the summer that never ends , but in the seventh year it broke suddenly , and we had a short autumn and a terrible long winter . Still , the heat was fierce while it lasted . Oldtown steamed and sweltered by day and came alive only by night . We would walk in the gardens by the river and argue about the gods . I remember the smells of those nights , my lord-perfume and sweat , melons ripe to bursting , peaches and pomegranates , nightshade and moonbloom . I was a young man then , still forging my chain . The heat did not exhaust me as it does now . ";Ned;Greatjon,Old,;0.00625;5375;172
Pycelle 's eyes were so heavily lidded he looked half-asleep . " My pardons , Lord Eddard . You did not come to hear foolish meanderings of a summer forgotten before your father was born . Forgive an old man his wanderings , if you would . Minds are like swords , I do fear . The old ones go to rust . Ah , and here is our milk . ";Pycelle;Maester,Ned,Arya,Sansa,Alyn,Littlefinger,Stark,Lord,Petyr,;0.1;5376;172
The serving girl placed the tray between them , and Pycelle gave her a smile . " Sweet child . ";Pycelle;Maester,Ned,Arya,Sansa,Alyn,Littlefinger,Stark,Lord,Petyr,;0.325;5377;172
He lifted a cup , tasted , nodded . " Thank you . You may go . ";Ned;Maester,Pycelle,Arya,Sansa,Alyn,Littlefinger,Stark,Lord,Petyr,;0.0;5378;172
When the girl had taken her leave , Pycelle peered at Ned through pale , rheumy eyes . " Now where were we ? Oh , yes . You asked about Lord Arryn ... ";Pycelle;Maester,Ned,Arya,Sansa,Alyn,Littlefinger,Stark,Lord,Petyr,;0.0;5379;172
" I did . ";Ned;Maester,Pycelle,Arya,Sansa,Alyn,Littlefinger,Stark,Lord,Petyr,;0.0;5380;172
" If truth be told , the Hand had not seemed quite himself for some time , " Pycelle said . " We had sat together on council many a year , he and I , and the signs were there to read , but I put them down to the great burdens he had borne so faithfully for so long . Those broad shoulders were weighed down by all the cares of the realm , and more besides . His son was ever sickly , and his lady wife so anxious that she would scarcely let the boy out of her sight . It was enough to weary even a strong man , and the Lord Jon was not young . Small wonder if he seemed melancholy and tired . Or so I thought at the time . Yet now I am less certain . ";Pycelle;Jon,;0.0788227513228;5383;172
" What can you tell me of his final illness ? ";Ned;Maester,Pycelle,Arya,Sansa,Alyn,Littlefinger,Stark,Lord,Petyr,;0.0;5385;172
The Grand Maester spread his hands in a gesture of helpless sorrow . " He came to me one day asking after a certain book , as hale and healthy as ever , though it did seem to me that something was troubling him deeply . The next morning he was twisted over in pain , too sick to rise from bed . Maester Colemon thought it was a chill on the stomach . The weather had been hot , and the Hand often iced his wine , which can upset the digestion . When Lord Jon continued to weaken , I went to him myself , but the gods did not grant me the power to save him . ";Maester;Maester,Jon,;0.0357142857143;5386;172
" I have heard that you sent Maester Colemon away . ";Ned;Maester,;0.0;5387;172
The Grand Maester 's nod was as slow and deliberate as a glacier . " I did , and I fear the Lady Lysa will never forgive me that . Maybe I was wrong , but at the time I thought it best . Maester Colemon is like a son to me , and I yield to none in my esteem for his abilities , but he is young , and the young ofttimes do not comprehend the frailty of an older body . He was purging Lord Arryn with wasting potions and pepper juice , and I feared he might kill him . ";Maester;Lysa,Maester,Lord,;0.152380952381;5388;172
" Did Lord Arryn say anything to you during his final hours ? ";Ned;Lord,;0.0;5389;172
Pycelle wrinkled his brow . " In the last stage of his fever , the Hand called out the name Robert several times , but whether he was asking for his son or for the king I could not say . Lady Lysa would not permit the boy to enter the sickroom , for fear that he too might be taken ill . The king did come , and he sat beside the bed for hours , talking and joking of times long past in hopes of raising Lord Jon 's spirits . His love was fierce to see . ";Pycelle;Lysa,Jon,;-0.05;5390;172
" Was there nothing else ? No final words ? ";Ned;Maester,Pycelle,Arya,Sansa,Alyn,Littlefinger,Stark,Lord,Petyr,;0.0;5391;172
" When I saw that all hope had fled , I gave the Hand the milk of the poppy , so he should not suffer . Just before he closed his eyes for the last time , he whispered something to the king and his lady wife , a blessing for his son . The seed is strong , he said . At the end , his speech was too slurred to comprehend . Death did not come until the next morning , but Lord Jon was at peace after that . He never spoke again . ";Pycelle;Jon,;0.0833333333333;5392;172
Ned took another swallow of milk , trying not to gag on the sweetness of it . " Did it seem to you that there was anything unnatural about Lord Arryn 's death ? ";Ned;Maester,Pycelle,Arya,Sansa,Alyn,Littlefinger,Stark,Lord,Petyr,;0.0;5393;172
" Unnatural ? ";Pycelle;Maester,Ned,Arya,Sansa,Alyn,Littlefinger,Stark,Lord,Petyr,;0.0;5394;172
The aged maester 's voice was thin as a whisper . " No , I could not say so . Sad , for a certainty . Yet in its own way , death is the most natural thing of all , Lord Eddard . Jon Arryn rests easy now , his burdens lifted at last . ";Littlefinger;Jon,;0.0791666666667;5395;172
" This illness that took him , " said Ned . " Had you ever seen its like before , in other men ? ";Ned;Maester,Pycelle,Arya,Sansa,Alyn,Littlefinger,Stark,Lord,Petyr,;-0.125;5396;172
" Near forty years I have been Grand Maester of the Seven Kingdoms , " Pycelle replied . " Under our good King Robert , and Aerys Targaryen before him , and his father Jaehaerys the Second before him , and even for a few short months under Jaehaerys 's father , Aegon the Fortunate , the Fifth of His Name . I have seen more of illness than I care to remember , my lord . I will tell you this : Every case is different , and every case is alike . Lord Jon 's death was no stranger than any other . ";Pycelle;Maester,;0.1825;5397;172
" His wife thought otherwise . ";Ned;Maester,Pycelle,Arya,Sansa,Alyn,Littlefinger,Stark,Lord,Petyr,;0.0;5398;172
The Grand Maester nodded . " I recall now , the widow is sister to your own noble wife . If an old man may be forgiven his blunt speech , let me say that grief can derange even the strongest and most disciplined of minds , and the Lady Lysa was never that . Since her last stillbirth , she has seen enemies in every shadow , and the death of her lord husband left her shattered and lost . ";Maester;Lysa,;0.1875;5399;172
" So you are quite certain that Jon Arryn died of a sudden illness ? ";Ned;Jon,;0.107142857143;5400;172
" I am , " Pycelle replied gravely . " If not illness , my good lord , what else could it be ? ";Pycelle;Maester,Ned,Arya,Sansa,Alyn,Littlefinger,Stark,Lord,Petyr,;0.65;5401;172
" Poison , " Ned suggested quietly .;Ned;Maester,Pycelle,Arya,Sansa,Alyn,Littlefinger,Stark,Lord,Petyr,;0.0;5402;172
The aged maester shifted uncomfortably in his seat . " A disturbing thought . We are not the Free Cities , where such things are common . Grand Maester Aethelmure wrote that all men carry murder in their hearts , yet even so , the poisoner is beneath contempt . ";Pycelle;Maester,;9.25185853854e-18;5404;172
He fell silent for a moment , his eyes lost in thought . " What you suggest is possible , my lord , yet I do not think it likely . Every hedge maester knows the common poisons , and Lord Arryn displayed none of the signs . And the Hand was loved by all . What sort of monster in man 's flesh would dare to murder such a noble lord ? ";Ned;Lord,;0.142857142857;5405;172
" I have heard it said that poison is a woman 's weapon . ";Littlefinger;Maester,Ned,Pycelle,Arya,Sansa,Alyn,Stark,Lord,Petyr,;0.0;5406;172
Pycelle stroked his beard thoughtfully . " It is said . Women , cravens ... and eunuchs . ";Pycelle;Maester,Ned,Arya,Sansa,Alyn,Littlefinger,Stark,Lord,Petyr,;0.0;5407;172
Above them , a raven cawed loudly in the rookery . " The Lord Varys was born a slave in Lys , did you know ? Put not your trust in spiders , my lord . ";Littlefinger;Lord,;0.0;5409;172
That was scarcely anything Ned needed to be told ; there was something about Varys that made his flesh crawl . " I will remember that , Maester . And I thank you for your help . I have taken enough of your time . ";Ned;Maester,Pycelle,Arya,Sansa,Alyn,Littlefinger,Stark,Lord,Petyr,;0.0;5410;172
Grand Maester Pycelle pushed himself up from his chair slowly and escorted Ned to the door . " I hope I have helped in some small way to put your mind at ease . If there is any other service I might perform , you need only ask . ";Maester;Ned,Pycelle,Arya,Sansa,Alyn,Littlefinger,Stark,Lord,Petyr,;0.03125;5412;172
" One thing , " Ned told him . " I should be curious to examine the book that you lent Jon the day before he fell ill . ";Ned;Maester,Pycelle,Arya,Sansa,Alyn,Littlefinger,Stark,Lord,Petyr,;-0.3;5413;172
" I fear you would find it of little interest , " Pycelle said . " It was a ponderous tome by Grand Maester Malleon on the lineages of the great houses . ";Pycelle;Maester,Ned,Arya,Sansa,Alyn,Littlefinger,Stark,Lord,Petyr,;0.370833333333;5414;172
" Still , I should like to see it . ";Ned;Maester,Pycelle,Arya,Sansa,Alyn,Littlefinger,Stark,Lord,Petyr,;0.0;5415;172
The old man opened the door . " As you wish . I have it here somewhere . When I find it , I shall have it sent to your chambers straightaway . ";Pycelle;Maester,Ned,Arya,Sansa,Alyn,Littlefinger,Stark,Lord,Petyr,;0.1;5416;172
" You have been most courteous , " Ned told him .;Ned;Maester,Pycelle,Arya,Sansa,Alyn,Littlefinger,Stark,Lord,Petyr,;0.55;5417;172
Then , almost as an afterthought , he said , " One last question , if you would be so kind . You mentioned that the king was at Lord Arryn 's bedside when he died . I wonder , was the queen with him ? ";Littlefinger;Maester,Ned,Pycelle,Arya,Sansa,Alyn,Stark,Lord,Petyr,;0.3;5418;172
" Why , no , " Pycelle said . " She and the children were making the journey to Casterly Rock , in company with her father . Lord Tywin had brought a retinue to the city for the tourney on Prince Joffrey 's name day , no doubt hoping to see his son Jaime win the champion 's crown . In that he was sadly disappointed . It fell to me to send the queen word of Lord Arryn 's sudden death . Never have I sent off a bird with a heavier heart . ";Pycelle;Lord,Jaime,;0.0166666666667;5419;172
" Dark wings , dark words , " Ned murmured .;Ned;Maester,Pycelle,Arya,Sansa,Alyn,Littlefinger,Stark,Lord,Petyr,;-0.15;5420;172
" So the fishwives say , " Grand Maester Pycelle agreed , " but we know it is not always so . When Maester Luwin 's bird brought the word about your Bran , the message lifted every true heart in the castle , did it not ? ";Maester;Ned,Pycelle,Arya,Sansa,Alyn,Littlefinger,Stark,Lord,Petyr,;0.425;5422;172
" As you say , Maester . ";Ned;Maester,Pycelle,Arya,Sansa,Alyn,Littlefinger,Stark,Lord,Petyr,;0.0;5423;172

Pycelle bowed his head . " Come to me as often as you like , Lord Eddard . I am here to serve . ";Pycelle;Maester,Ned,Arya,Sansa,Alyn,Littlefinger,Stark,Lord,Petyr,;0.0;5425;172
Ned stopped and looked at her . " Arya , what are you doing ? ";Ned;Maester,Pycelle,Arya,Sansa,Alyn,Littlefinger,Stark,Lord,Petyr,;0.0;5429;172
" Syrio says a water dancer can stand on one toe for hours . ";Pycelle;Syrio,;0.0;5430;172
Ned had to smile . " Which toe ? ";Ned;Maester,Pycelle,Arya,Sansa,Alyn,Littlefinger,Stark,Lord,Petyr,;0.3;5432;172
" Any toe , " Arya said , exasperated with the question .;Arya;Maester,Ned,Pycelle,Sansa,Alyn,Littlefinger,Stark,Lord,Petyr,;0.0;5434;172
" Must you do your standing here ? ";Ned;Maester,Pycelle,Arya,Sansa,Alyn,Littlefinger,Stark,Lord,Petyr,;0.0;5436;172
he asked . " It 's a long hard fall down these steps . ";Pycelle;Maester,Ned,Arya,Sansa,Alyn,Littlefinger,Stark,Lord,Petyr,;-0.165740740741;5437;172
" Syrio says a water dancer never falls . ";Ned;Syrio,;0.0;5438;172
She lowered her leg to stand on two feet . " Father , will Bran come and live with us now ? ";Pycelle;Bran,;0.136363636364;5439;172
" Not for a long time , sweet one , " he told her . " He needs to win his strength back . ";Ned;Maester,Pycelle,Arya,Sansa,Alyn,Littlefinger,Stark,Lord,Petyr,;0.275;5440;172
Arya bit her lip . " What will Bran do when he 's of age ? ";Arya;Bran,;0.0;5441;172
Ned knelt beside her . " He has years to find that answer , Arya . For now , it is enough to know that he will live . ";Ned;Maester,Pycelle,Arya,Sansa,Alyn,Littlefinger,Stark,Lord,Petyr,;0.0681818181818;5442;172
When dawn broke over the city , the dark red blooms of dragon 's breath surrounded the girls where they lay . " I dreamed of Bran , " Sansa had whispered to him . " I saw him smiling . ";Sansa;Maester,Ned,Pycelle,Arya,Alyn,Littlefinger,Stark,Lord,Petyr,;-0.075;5447;172
" He was going to be a knight , " Arya was saying now . " A knight of the Kingsguard . Can he still be a knight ? ";Arya;Maester,Ned,Pycelle,Sansa,Alyn,Littlefinger,Stark,Lord,Petyr,;0.0;5448;172
" No , " Ned said .;Ned;Maester,Pycelle,Arya,Sansa,Alyn,Littlefinger,Stark,Lord,Petyr,;0.0;5449;172
He saw no use in lying to her . " Yet someday he may be the lord of a great holdfast and sit on the king 's council . He might raise castles like Brandon the Builder , or sail a ship across the Sunset Sea , or enter your mother 's Faith and become the High Septon . ";Pycelle;High,;0.48;5450;172
Arya cocked her head to one side . " Can I be a king 's councillor and build castles and become the High Septon ? ";Arya;High,;0.16;5452;172
" You , " Ned said , kissing her lightly on the brow , " will marry a king and rule his castle , and your sons will be knights and princes and lords and , yes , perhaps even a High Septon . ";Ned;Maester,Pycelle,Arya,Sansa,Alyn,Littlefinger,Stark,Lord,Petyr,;0.16;5453;172
Arya screwed up her face . " No , " she said , " that 's Sansa . ";Arya;Sansa,;0.0;5454;172
Alyn entered as he was drying his face . " My lord , " he said , " Lord Baelish is without and begs audience . ";Alyn;Lord,;0.0;5458;172
" Escort him to my solar , " Ned said , reaching for a fresh tunic , the lightest linen he could find . " I 'll see him at once . ";Ned;Maester,Pycelle,Arya,Sansa,Alyn,Littlefinger,Stark,Lord,Petyr,;0.3;5459;172
Littlefinger was perched on the window seat when Ned entered , watching the knights of the Kingsguard practice at swords in the yard below . " If only old Selmy 's mind were as nimble as his blade , " he said wistfully , " our council meetings would be a good deal livelier . ";Littlefinger;Maester,Ned,Pycelle,Arya,Sansa,Alyn,Stark,Lord,Petyr,;0.25;5460;172
" Ser Barristan is as valiant and honorable as any man in King 's Landing . ";Ned;Serrett,;0.0;5461;172
" And as tiresome , " Littlefinger added , " though I daresay he should do well in the tourney . Last year he unhorsed the Hound , and it was only four years ago that he was champion . ";Littlefinger;Hound,;-0.166666666667;5463;172
The question of who might win the tourney interested Eddard Stark not in the least . " Is there a reason for this visit , Lord Petyr , or are you here simply to enjoy the view from my window ? ";Stark;Maester,Ned,Pycelle,Arya,Sansa,Alyn,Littlefinger,Lord,Petyr,;0.19;5464;172
Littlefinger smiled . " I promised Cat I would help you in your inquiries , and so I have . ";Littlefinger;Maester,Ned,Pycelle,Arya,Sansa,Alyn,Stark,Lord,Petyr,;0.6;5465;172
Promise or no promise , he could not find it in him to trust Lord Petyr Baelish , who struck him as too clever by half . " You have something for me ? ";Lord;Maester,Ned,Pycelle,Arya,Sansa,Alyn,Littlefinger,Stark,Petyr,;0.0;5467;172
" Someone , " Littlefinger corrected . " Four someones , if truth be told . Had you thought to question the Hand 's servants ? ";Littlefinger;Maester,Ned,Pycelle,Arya,Sansa,Alyn,Stark,Lord,Petyr,;0.0;5468;172
Ned frowned . " Would that I could . Lady Arryn took her household back to the Eyrie . ";Ned;Arryn,;0.0;5469;172
" Most of her household , " Littlefinger said , " not all . A few remain . A pregnant kitchen girl hastily wed to one of Lord Renly 's grooms , a stablehand who joined the City Watch , a potboy discharged from service for theft , and Lord Arryn 's squire . ";Littlefinger;Maester,Ned,Pycelle,Arya,Sansa,Alyn,Stark,Lord,Petyr,;0.211111111111;5472;172
" His squire ? ";Ned;Maester,Pycelle,Arya,Sansa,Alyn,Littlefinger,Stark,Lord,Petyr,;0.0;5473;172
" Ser Hugh of the Vale , " Littlefinger named him . " The king knighted the boy after Lord Arryn 's death . ";Littlefinger;Maester,Ned,Pycelle,Arya,Sansa,Alyn,Stark,Lord,Petyr,;0.0;5476;172
" I shall send for him , " Ned said . " And the others . ";Ned;Maester,Pycelle,Arya,Sansa,Alyn,Littlefinger,Stark,Lord,Petyr,;0.0;5477;172
Littlefinger winced . " My lord , step over here to the window , if you would be so kind . ";Littlefinger;Maester,Ned,Pycelle,Arya,Sansa,Alyn,Stark,Lord,Petyr,;0.6;5478;172
" Why ? ";Ned;Maester,Pycelle,Arya,Sansa,Alyn,Littlefinger,Stark,Lord,Petyr,;0.0;5479;172
" Come , and I 'll show you , my lord . ";Pycelle;Maester,Ned,Arya,Sansa,Alyn,Littlefinger,Stark,Lord,Petyr,;0.0;5480;172
Petyr Baelish made a casual gesture . " There , across the yard , at the door of the armory , do you see the boy squatting by the steps honing a sword with an oilstone ? ";Petyr;Maester,Ned,Pycelle,Arya,Sansa,Alyn,Littlefinger,Stark,Lord,;-0.5;5482;172
" What of him ? ";Ned;Maester,Pycelle,Arya,Sansa,Alyn,Littlefinger,Stark,Lord,Petyr,;0.0;5483;172
" He reports to Varys . The Spider has taken a great interest in you and all your doings . ";Pycelle;Varys,;0.8;5484;172
He shifted in the window seat . " Now glance at the wall . Farther west , above the stables . The guardsman leaning on the ramparts ? ";Littlefinger;Maester,Ned,Pycelle,Arya,Sansa,Alyn,Stark,Lord,Petyr,;0.0;5485;172
Ned saw the man . " Another of the eunuch 's whisperers ? ";Ned;Maester,Pycelle,Arya,Sansa,Alyn,Littlefinger,Stark,Lord,Petyr,;0.0;5486;172
" No , this one belongs to the queen . Notice that he enjoys a fine view of the door to this tower , the better to note who calls on you . There are others , many unknown even to me . The Red Keep is full of eyes . Why do you think I hid Cat in a brothel ? ";Pycelle;Cat,;0.277777777778;5487;172
Eddard Stark had no taste for these intrigues . " Seven hells , " he swore .;Stark;Maester,Ned,Pycelle,Arya,Sansa,Alyn,Littlefinger,Lord,Petyr,;-0.2;5488;172
Suddenly uncomfortable , Ned moved away from the window . " Is everyone someone 's informer in this cursed city ? ";Ned;Maester,Pycelle,Arya,Sansa,Alyn,Littlefinger,Stark,Lord,Petyr,;-0.5;5490;172
" Scarcely , " said Littlefinger .;Littlefinger;Maester,Ned,Pycelle,Arya,Sansa,Alyn,Stark,Lord,Petyr,;0.0;5491;172
He counted on the fingers on his hand . " Why , there 's me , you , the king ... although , come to think on it , the king tells the queen much too much , and I 'm less than certain about you . ";Ned;Maester,Pycelle,Arya,Sansa,Alyn,Littlefinger,Stark,Lord,Petyr,;0.0619047619048;5492;172
He stood up . " Is there a man in your service that you trust utterly and completely ? ";Pycelle;Maester,Ned,Arya,Sansa,Alyn,Littlefinger,Stark,Lord,Petyr,;0.0;5493;172
" Yes , " said Ned .;Ned;Maester,Pycelle,Arya,Sansa,Alyn,Littlefinger,Stark,Lord,Petyr,;0.0;5494;172
" In that case , I have a delightful palace in Valyria that I would dearly love to sell you , " Littlefinger said with a mocking smile . " The wiser answer was no , my lord , but be that as it may . Send this paragon of yours to Ser Hugh and the others . Your own comings and goings will be noted , but even Varys the Spider cannot watch every man in your service every hour of the day . ";Littlefinger;Varys,;0.6;5495;172
" Lord Petyr , " Ned called after him . " I ... am grateful for your help . Perhaps I was wrong to distrust you . ";Ned;Maester,Pycelle,Arya,Sansa,Alyn,Littlefinger,Stark,Lord,Petyr,;-0.5;5497;172
Littlefinger fingered his small pointed beard . " You are slow to learn , Lord Eddard . Distrusting me was the wisest thing you 've done since you climbed down off your horse . ";Littlefinger;Maester,Ned,Pycelle,Arya,Sansa,Alyn,Stark,Lord,Petyr,;-0.235185185185;5498;172
Jon was showing Dareon how best to deliver a sidestroke when the new recruit entered the practice yard . " Your feet should be farther apart , " he urged . " You do n't want to lose your balance . That 's good . Now pivot as you deliver the stroke , get all your weight behind the blade . ";Jon;Dareon,Pyp,Alliser,;0.346590909091;5502;173
Dareon broke off and lifted his visor . " Seven gods , " he murmured . " Would you look at this , Jon . ";Dareon;Jon,Pyp,Alliser,;0.0;5503;173
Pale eyes moved nervously in a great round moon of a face , and plump sweaty fingers wiped themselves on the velvet of his doublet . " They ... they told me I was to come here for ... for training , " he said to no one in particular .;Alliser;Jon,Dareon,Pyp,;0.255555555556;5508;173
" A lordling , " Pyp observed to Jon . " Southron , most like near Highgarden . ";Pyp;Jon,Dareon,Alliser,;0.3;5509;173
Ser Alliser Thorne looked over his new charge and said , " It would seem they have run short of poachers and thieves down south . Now they send us pigs to man the Wall . Is fur and velvet your notion of armor , my Lord of Ham ? ";Alliser;King,;-0.00639730639731;5513;173
Dressed for battle , the new boy looked like an overcooked sausage about to burst its skin . " Let us hope you are not as inept as you look , " Ser Alliser said . " Halder , see what Ser Piggy can do . ";Alliser;Piggy,;0.136363636364;5520;174
He was sixteen , tall and muscular , and his blows were as hard as any Jon had ever felt . " This will be uglier than a whore 's ass , " Pyp muttered , and it was .;Jon;Alliser,Halder,Pyp,Rast,;-0.291666666667;5523;174
The fight lasted less than a minute before the fat boy was on the ground , his whole body shaking as blood leaked through his shattered helm and between his pudgy fingers . " I yield , " he shrilled . " No more , I yield , do n't hit me . ";Halder;Alliser,Jon,Pyp,Rast,;0.177777777778;5524;174
Even then , Ser Alliser would not call an end . " On your feet , Ser Piggy , " he called . " Pick up your sword . ";Alliser;Jon,Halder,Pyp,Rast,;0.0;5526;174
When the boy continued to cling to the ground , Thorne gestured to Halder . " Hit him with the flat of your blade until he finds his feet . ";Alliser;Jon,Halder,Pyp,Rast,;-0.025;5527;174
Halder delivered a tentative smack to his foe 's upraised cheeks . " You can hit harder than that , " Thorne taunted .;Halder;Alliser,Jon,Pyp,Rast,;-0.1;5528;174
Pyp laid a mailed hand on his arm . " Jon , no , " the small boy whispered with an anxious glance at Ser Alliser Thorne .;Pyp;Alliser,Jon,Halder,Rast,;-0.25;5532;174
" On your feet , " Thorne repeated .;Alliser;Jon,Halder,Pyp,Rast,;0.0;5533;174
The fat boy struggled to rise , slipped , and fell heavily again . " Ser Piggy is starting to grasp the notion , " Ser Alliser observed . " Again . ";Alliser;Piggy,;0.0;5534;174
Halder lifted the sword for another blow . " Cut us off a ham ! ";Halder;Alliser,Jon,Pyp,Rast,;0.0;5535;174
Jon shook off Pyp 's hand . " Halder , enough . ";Jon;Alliser,Halder,Pyp,Rast,;0.0;5537;174
" The Bastard speaks and the peasants tremble , " the master-at-arms said in that sharp , cold voice of his . " I remind you that I am the master-at-arms here , Lord Snow . ";Alliser;Jon,Halder,Pyp,Rast,;-0.3625;5539;174
" Look at him , Halder , " Jon urged , ignoring Thorne as best he could . " There 's no honor in beating a fallen foe . He yielded . ";Jon;Alliser,Halder,Pyp,Rast,;1.0;5540;174
Halder lowered his sword . " He yielded , " he echoed .;Halder;Alliser,Jon,Pyp,Rast,;0.0;5542;174
Ser Alliser 's onyx eyes were fixed on Jon Snow . " It would seem our Bastard is in love , " he said as Jon helped the fat boy to his feet . " Show me your steel , Lord Snow . ";Jon;Alliser,Halder,Pyp,Rast,;0.3;5543;174
Thorne smiled . " The Bastard wishes to defend his lady love , so we shall make an exercise of it . Rat , Pimple , help our Stone Head here . ";Alliser;Head,;0.55;5546;174
Rast and Albett moved to join Halder . " Three of you ought to be sufficient to make Lady Piggy squeal . All you need do is get past the Bastard . ";Rast;Piggy,;-0.25;5547;174
" Stay behind me , " Jon said to the fat boy .;Jon;Alliser,Halder,Pyp,Rast,;-0.4;5548;174
Suddenly Pyp was beside him . " Three to two will make for better sport , " the small boy said cheerfully .;Pyp;Alliser,Jon,Halder,Rast,;0.125;5552;174
Jon could feel Ser Alliser 's eyes . " Why are you waiting ? ";Jon;Alliser,Halder,Pyp,Rast,;0.0;5556;174
Facing two swords , Albett backed away . " I yield , " he shouted .;Albett;Alliser,Jon,Blood,Sam,Pyp,Grenn,;0.0;5573;175
Ser Alliser Thorne surveyed the scene with disgust . " The mummer 's farce has gone on long enough for today . ";Alliser;Albett,Jon,Blood,Sam,Pyp,Grenn,;-0.025;5574;175
The quarryman 's son wrenched off his helm and threw it across the yard . " For an instant , I thought I finally had you , Snow . ";Grenn;Albett,Alliser,Jon,Blood,Sam,Pyp,;0.0;5578;175
" For an instant , you did , " Jon replied .;Jon;Albett,Alliser,Blood,Sam,Pyp,Grenn,;0.0;5579;175
" Let me , " a voice said .;Grenn;Albett,Alliser,Jon,Blood,Sam,Pyp,;0.0;5582;175
Thick-fingered hands unfastened helm from gorget and lifted it off gently . " Did he hurt you ? ";Jon;Albett,Alliser,Blood,Sam,Pyp,Grenn,;0.0;5583;175
" I 've been bruised before . ";Grenn;Albett,Alliser,Jon,Blood,Sam,Pyp,;0.0;5584;175
Blood matted the fat boy 's hair where Halder had split his helm asunder . " My name is Samwell Tarly , of Horn ... ";Blood;Sam,;0.0;5587;175
He stopped and licked his lips . " I mean , I was of Horn Hill , until I ... left . I 've come to take the black . My father is Lord Randyll , a bannerman to the Tyrells of Highgarden . I used to be his heir , only ... ";Grenn;Lord,;-0.119791666667;5588;175
" I 'm Jon Snow , Ned Stark 's bastard , of Winterfell . ";Jon;Jon,;-0.2;5590;175
Samwell Tarly nodded . " I ... if you want , you can call me Sam . My mother calls me Sam . ";Sam;Sam,;0.0;5591;175
" You can call him Lord Snow , " Pyp said as he came up to join them . " You do n't want to know what his mother calls him . ";Pyp;Snow,;0.0;5592;175
" These two are Grenn and Pypar , " Jon said .;Jon;Pyp,;0.0;5593;175
" Grenn 's the ugly one , " Pyp said .;Pyp;Grenn,;-0.7;5594;175
Grenn scowled . " You 're uglier than me . At least I do n't have ears like a bat . ";Grenn;Albett,Alliser,Jon,Blood,Sam,Pyp,;-0.3;5595;175
" My thanks to all of you , " the fat boy said gravely .;Jon;Albett,Alliser,Blood,Sam,Pyp,Grenn,;0.2;5596;175
" Why did n't you get up and fight ? ";Grenn;Albett,Alliser,Jon,Blood,Sam,Pyp,;0.0;5597;175
" I wanted to , truly . I just ... I could n't . I did n't want him to hit me anymore . ";Jon;Albett,Alliser,Blood,Sam,Pyp,Grenn,;0.0;5599;175
He looked at the ground . " I ... I fear I 'm a coward . My lord father always said so . ";Grenn;Albett,Alliser,Jon,Blood,Sam,Pyp,;0.0;5600;175
His eyes met Jon 's and darted away , quick as frightened animals . " I ... I 'm sorry , " he said . " I do n't mean to ... to be like I am . ";Jon;Albett,Alliser,Blood,Sam,Pyp,Grenn,;-0.159722222222;5605;175
Jon called after him . " You were hurt , " he said . " Tomorrow you 'll do better . ";Jon;Albett,Alliser,Blood,Sam,Pyp,Grenn,;0.5;5607;175
Sam looked mournfully back over one shoulder . " No I wo n't , " he said , blinking back tears . " I never do better . ";Sam;Albett,Alliser,Jon,Blood,Pyp,Grenn,;0.166666666667;5608;175
When he was gone , Grenn frowned . " Nobody likes cravens , " he said uncomfortably . " I wish we had n't helped him . What if they think we 're craven too ? ";Grenn;Albett,Alliser,Jon,Blood,Sam,Pyp,;0.0;5609;175
" You 're too stupid to be craven , " Pyp told him .;Pyp;Albett,Alliser,Jon,Blood,Sam,Grenn,;-0.8;5610;175
" I am not , " Grenn said .;Grenn;Albett,Alliser,Jon,Blood,Sam,Pyp,;0.0;5611;175
" Yes you are . If a bear attacked you in the woods , you'd be too stupid to run away . ";Jon;Albett,Alliser,Blood,Sam,Pyp,Grenn,;-0.8;5612;175
" I would not , " Grenn insisted . " I'd run away faster than you . ";Grenn;I'd,;0.0;5613;175
The fat boy 's eyes widened at the sight of Ghost . " Is that a wolf ? ";Jon;Sam,;0.0;5642;176
" A direwolf , " Jon said . " His name is Ghost . The direwolf is the sigil of my father 's House . ";Jon;Sam,;0.0;5643;176
" Ours is a striding huntsman , " Samwell Tarly said .;Sam;Jon,;0.0;5644;176
" Do you like to hunt ? ";Jon;Sam,;0.0;5645;176
The fat boy shuddered . " I hate it . ";Jon;Sam,;-0.8;5646;176
" What 's wrong now ? ";Jon;Sam,;-0.5;5648;176
Jon asked him . " Why are you always so frightened ? ";Jon;Sam,;0.0;5649;176
He stood . " Let 's go outside . ";Jon;Sam,;0.0;5653;176
The round fat face looked up at him , suspicious . " Why ? What will we do outside ? ";Jon;Sam,;-0.1;5654;176
" Talk , " Jon said . " Have you seen the Wall ? ";Jon;King,;0.0;5655;176
" I 'm fat , not blind , " Samwell Tarly said . " Of course I saw it , it 's seven hundred feet high . ";Sam;Jon,;-0.17;5656;176
Ghost padded along beside them . " I never thought it would be like this , " Sam said as they walked , his words steaming in the cold air .;Sam;Jon,;-0.6;5658;176
Already he was huffing and puffing as he tried to keep up . " All the buildings are falling down , and it 's so ... so ... ";Jon;Sam,;-0.155555555556;5659;176
" Cold ? ";Jon;Sam,;-0.6;5660;176
Sam nodded miserably . " I hate the cold , " he said . " Last night I woke up in the dark and the fire had gone out and I was certain I was going to freeze to death by morning . ";Sam;Jon,;-0.267142857143;5662;176
" It must have been warmer where you come from . ";Jon;Sam,;0.0;5663;176
" I never saw snow until last month . We were crossing the barrowlands , me and the men my father sent to see me north , and this white stuff began to fall , like a soft rain . At first I thought it was so beautiful , like feathers drifting from the sky , but it kept on and on , until I was frozen to the bone . The men had crusts of snow in their beards and more on their shoulders , and still it kept coming . I was afraid it would never end . ";Jon;Sam,;0.157142857143;5664;176
In the sky above , the stars burned clear and sharp . " Are they going to make me go up there ? ";Jon;Sam,;-0.00833333333333;5667;176
His face curdled like old milk as he looked at the great wooden stairs . " I 'll die if I have to climb that . ";Jon;Sam,;0.3;5669;176
" There 's a winch , " Jon said , pointing . " They can draw you up in a cage . ";Jon;Sam,;0.0;5670;176
Samwell Tarly sniffled . " I do n't like high places . ";Sam;Jon,;0.16;5671;176
Jon frowned , incredulous . " Are you afraid of everything ? ";Jon;Sam,;-0.6;5673;176
he asked . " I do n't understand . If you are truly so craven , why are you here ? Why would a coward want to join the Night 's Watch ? ";Jon;Night,;0.0;5674;176
" Sometimes I dream about it , " he said . " I 'm walking down this long empty hall . My voice echoes all around , but no one answers , so I walk faster , opening doors , shouting names . I do n't even know who I 'm looking for . Most nights it 's my father , but sometimes it 's Robb instead , or my little sister Arya , or my uncle . ";Winterfell;instead,;0.00138888888889;5688;177
" Do you ever find anyone in your dream ? ";Sam;Winterfell,Jon,;0.0;5693;177
Jon shook his head . " No one . The castle is always empty . ";Jon;Winterfell,Sam,;-0.1;5695;177
He had never told anyone of the dream , and he did not understand why he was telling Sam now , yet somehow it felt good to talk of it . " Even the ravens are gone from the rookery , and the stables are full of bones . That always scares me . I start to run then , throwing open doors , climbing the tower three steps at a time , screaming for someone , for anyone . And then I find myself in front of the door to the crypts . It 's black inside , and I can see the steps spiraling down . Somehow I know I have to go down there , but I do n't want to . I 'm afraid of what might be waiting for me . The old Kings of Winter are down there , sitting on their thrones with stone wolves at their feet and iron swords across their laps , but it 's not them I 'm afraid of . I scream that I 'm not a Stark , that this is n't my place , but it 's no good , I have to go anyway , so I start down , feeling the walls as I descend , with no torch to light the way . It gets darker and darker , until I want to scream . ";Sam;Winterfell,;-0.00277777777778;5696;177
He stopped , frowning , embarrassed . " That 's when I always wake . ";Winterfell;Jon,Sam,;0.0;5697;177
He would go back to sleep with his face pressed into the direwolf 's shaggy white fur . " Do you dream of Horn Hill ? ";Jon;Winterfell,Sam,;0.0;5700;177
" No . ";Winterfell;Jon,Sam,;0.0;5702;177
Sam 's mouth grew tight and hard . " I hated it there . ";Sam;Winterfell,Jon,;-0.456746031746;5703;177
He only grew fatter and more frightened , until Lord Randyll 's disappointment turned to anger and then to loathing . " One time , " Sam confided , his voice dropping from a whisper , " two men came to the castle , warlocks from Qarth with white skin and blue lips . They slaughtered a bull aurochs and made me bathe in the hot blood , but it did n't make me brave as they'd promised . I got sick and retched . Father had them scourged . ";Sam;Father,;-0.0515873015873;5716;178
Three men-at-arms had escorted him into a wood near Horn Hill , where his father was skinning a deer . " You are almost a man grown now , and my heir , " Lord Randyll Tarly had told his eldest son , his long knife laying bare the carcass as he spoke . " You have given me no cause to disown you , but neither will I allow you to inherit the land and title that should be Dickon ' s. Heartsbane must go to a man strong enough to wield her , and you are not worthy to touch her hilt . So I have decided that you shall this day announce that you wish to take the black . You will forsake all claim to your brother 's inheritance and start north before evenfall .;Lord;Heartsbane,Dickon,;0.1;5721;178
" If you do not , then on the morrow we shall have a hunt , and somewhere in these woods your horse will stumble , and you will be thrown from the saddle to die ... or so I will tell your mother . She has a woman 's heart and finds it in her to cherish even you , and I have no wish to cause her pain . Please do not imagine that it will truly be that easy , should you think to defy me . Nothing would please me more than to hunt you down like the pig you are . ";Jon;Sam,Lord,Grenn,Jeren,;0.259259259259;5722;178
His arms were red to the elbow as he laid the skinning knife aside . " So . There is your choice . The Night 's Watch"-he reached inside the deer , ripped out its heart , and held it in his fist , red and dripping-"or this . ";Sam;Lord,Jon,Grenn,Jeren,;0.0;5723;178
Finally Jon said , " We should go back to the common hall . ";Jon;Sam,Lord,Grenn,Jeren,;-0.15;5728;178
" Why ? ";Sam;Lord,Jon,Grenn,Jeren,;0.0;5729;178
Jon shrugged . " There 's hot cider to drink , or mulled wine if you prefer . Some nights Dareon sings for us , if the mood is on him . He was a singer , before ... well , not truly , but almost , an apprentice singer . ";Jon;Dareon,;0.25;5731;178
" How did he come here ? ";Sam;Lord,Jon,Grenn,Jeren,;0.0;5732;178
" Lord Rowan of Goldengrove found him in bed with his daughter . The girl was two years older , and Dareon swears she helped him through her window , but under her father 's eye she named it rape , so here he is . When Maester Aemon heard him sing , he said his voice was honey poured over thunder . ";Lord;Gold,Dareon,Maester,;0.166666666667;5734;178
Jon smiled . " Toad sometimes sings too , if you call it singing . Drinking songs he learned in his father 's winesink . Pyp says his voice is piss poured over a fart . ";Jon;Pyp,;0.6;5735;178
" I should like to hear them both , " Sam admitted , " but they would not want me there . ";Sam;Lord,Jon,Grenn,Jeren,;0.0;5737;178
His face was troubled . " He 's going to make me fight again on the morrow , is n't he ? ";Lord;Sam,Jon,Grenn,Jeren,;-0.5;5738;178
" He is , " Jon was forced to say .;Jon;Sam,Lord,Grenn,Jeren,;-0.3;5739;178
Sam got awkwardly to his feet . " I had better try to sleep , " He huddled down in his cloak and plodded off .;Sam;Lord,Jon,Grenn,Jeren,;0.172222222222;5740;178
The others were still in the common room when Jon returned , alone but for Ghost . " Where have you been ? ";Jon;Sam,Lord,Grenn,Jeren,;-0.3;5741;178
" Talking with Sam , " he said .;Sam;Lord,Jon,Grenn,Jeren,;0.0;5743;178
" He truly is craven , " said Grenn . " At supper , there were still places on the bench when he got his pie , but he was too scared to come sit with us . ";Grenn;Sam,Lord,Jon,Jeren,;0.0;5744;178
" The Lord of Ham thinks he 's too good to eat with the likes of us , " suggested Jeren .;Jeren;Ham,;0.65;5745;178
" I saw him eat a pork pie , " Toad said , smirking . " Do you think it was a brother ? ";Jon;Sam,Lord,Grenn,Jeren,;0.0;5746;178
" Stop it ! ";Sam;Lord,Jon,Grenn,Jeren,;0.0;5748;178
The other boys fell silent , taken aback by his sudden fury . " Listen to me , " Jon said into the quiet , and he told them how it was going to be .;Jon;Sam,Lord,Grenn,Jeren,;-0.03125;5750;178
" You girls do as you please , " Rast said , " but if Thorne sends me against Lady Piggy , I 'm going to slice me off a rasher of bacon . ";Rast;Alliser,Piggy,;0.0;5757;179
The direwolf 's eyes burned red as embers as his teeth nipped lightly at the soft skin of the boy 's throat , just enough to draw blood . " Remember , we know where you sleep , " Jon said softly .;Jon;Rast,;0.0333333333333;5762;179
One night he visited Jon in his cell . " I do n't know what you did , " he said , " but I know you did it . ";Jon;Sam,;0.0;5771;180
He looked away shyly . " I 've never had a friend before . ";Jon;Sam,;0.0;5772;180
" We 're not friends , " Jon said .;Jon;Sam,;0.0;5773;180
He put a hand on Sam 's broad shoulder . " We 're brothers . ";Sam;Jon,;0.0625;5774;180
" My uncle spoke truly , " he whispered to Ghost .;Jon;Sam,;0.0;5779;180
" It 's the Hand 's tourney that 's the cause of all the trouble , my lords , " the Commander of the City Watch complained to the king 's council .;Commander;Ned,Varys,Lord,Slynt,Maester,Littlefinger,;-0.3;5784;181
" The king 's tourney , " Ned corrected , wincing . " I assure you , the Hand wants no part of it . ";Ned;Commander,Varys,Lord,Slynt,Maester,Littlefinger,;0.2;5785;181
" Call it what you will , my lord . Knights have been arriving from all over the realm , and for every knight we get two freeriders , three craftsmen , six men-at-arms , a dozen merchants , two dozen whores , and more thieves than I dare guess . This cursed heat had half the city in a fever to start , and now with all these visitors ... last night we had a drowning , a tavern riot , three knife fights , a rape , two fires , robberies beyond count , and a drunken horse race down the Street of the Sisters . The night before a woman 's head was found in the Great Sept , floating in the rainbow pool . No one seems to know how it got there or who it belongs to . ";Lord;Knight,;0.195555555556;5786;181
" How dreadful , " Varys said with a shudder .;Varys;Commander,Ned,Lord,Slynt,Maester,Littlefinger,;-1.0;5787;181
Lord Renly Baratheon was less sympathetic . " If you cannot keep the king 's peace , Janos , perhaps the City Watch should be commanded by someone who can . ";Lord;Commander,Ned,Varys,Slynt,Maester,Littlefinger,;0.166666666667;5788;181
Stout , jowly Janos Slynt puffed himself up like an angry frog , his bald pate reddening . " Aegon the Dragon himself could not keep the peace , Lord Renly . I need more men . ";Slynt;Commander,Ned,Varys,Lord,Maester,Littlefinger,;0.0;5789;181
" How many ? ";Ned;Commander,Varys,Lord,Slynt,Maester,Littlefinger,;0.5;5790;181
" As many as can be gotten , Lord Hand . ";Slynt;Commander,Ned,Varys,Lord,Maester,Littlefinger,;0.5;5793;181
" Hire fifty new men , " Ned told him . " Lord Baelish will see that you get the coin . ";Ned;Lord,;0.136363636364;5794;181
" I will ? ";Slynt;Commander,Ned,Varys,Lord,Maester,Littlefinger,;0.0;5795;181
" You will . You found forty thousand golden dragons for a champion 's purse , surely you can scrape together a few coppers to keep the king 's peace . ";Lord;Commander,Ned,Varys,Slynt,Maester,Littlefinger,;0.05;5797;181
Ned turned back to Janos Slynt . " I will also give you twenty good swords from my own household guard , to serve with the Watch until the crowds have left . ";Ned;Commander,Varys,Lord,Slynt,Maester,Littlefinger,;0.3125;5798;181
" All thanks , Lord Hand , " Slynt said , bowing . " I promise you , they shall be put to good use . ";Slynt;Commander,Ned,Varys,Lord,Maester,Littlefinger,;0.425;5799;181
When the Commander had taken his leave , Eddard Stark turned to the rest of the council . " The sooner this folly is done with , the better I shall like it . ";Commander;Ned,Varys,Lord,Slynt,Maester,Littlefinger,;0.15;5800;181
As if the expense and trouble were not irksome enough , all and sundry insisted on salting Ned 's wound by calling it " the Hand 's tourney , " as if he were the cause of it .;Ned;Commander,Varys,Lord,Slynt,Maester,Littlefinger,;0.0;5801;181
" The realm prospers from such events , my lord , " Grand Maester Pycelle said . " They bring the great the chance of glory , and the lowly a respite from their woes . ";Maester;Commander,Ned,Varys,Lord,Slynt,Littlefinger,;0.433333333333;5803;181
" And put coins in many a pocket , " Littlefinger added . " Every inn in the city is full , and the whores are walking bowlegged and jingling with each step . ";Littlefinger;Commander,Ned,Varys,Lord,Slynt,Maester,;0.425;5804;181
Lord Renly laughed . " We 're fortunate my brother Stannis is not with us . Remember the time he proposed to outlaw brothels ? The king asked him if perhaps he'd like to outlaw eating , shitting , and breathing while he was at it . If truth be told , I ofttimes wonder how Stannis ever got that ugly daughter of his . He goes to his marriage bed like a man marching to a battlefield , with a grim look in his eyes and a determination to do his duty . ";Lord;Stannis,;-0.15;5805;181
Ned had not joined the laughter . " I wonder about your brother Stannis as well . I wonder when he intends to end his visit to Dragonstone and resume his seat on this council . ";Ned;Commander,Varys,Lord,Slynt,Maester,Littlefinger,;0.0;5806;181
" No doubt as soon as we 've scourged all those whores into the sea , " Littlefinger replied , provoking more laughter .;Littlefinger;Commander,Ned,Varys,Lord,Slynt,Maester,;0.5;5807;181
" I have heard quite enough about whores for one day , " Ned said , rising . " Until the morrow . ";Ned;Commander,Varys,Lord,Slynt,Maester,Littlefinger,;0.0;5808;181
Harwin had the door when Ned returned to the Tower of the Hand . " Summon Jory to my chambers and tell your father to saddle my horse , " Ned told him , too brusquely .;Ned;Jory,;0.0;5809;181
" As you say , my lord . ";Slynt;Commander,Ned,Varys,Lord,Maester,Littlefinger,;0.0;5810;181
The Red Keep and the " Hand 's tourney " were chafing him raw , Ned reflected as he climbed .;Ned;Commander,Varys,Lord,Slynt,Maester,Littlefinger,;-0.115384615385;5811;181
Ned closed Malleon 's tome and bid him enter . " I 've promised the City Watch twenty of my guard until the tourney is done , " he told him . " I rely on you to make the choice . Give Alyn the command , and make certain the men understand that they are needed to stop fights , not start them . ";Ned;Jory,;0.0571428571429;5826;182
Rising , Ned opened a cedar chest and removed a light linen undertunic . " Did you find the stableboy ? ";Ned;Jory,;0.4;5827;182
" The watchman , my lord , " Jory said . " He vows he 'll never touch another horse . ";Jory;Ned,;0.0;5828;182
" What did he have to say ? ";Ned;Jory,;0.0;5829;182
" He claims he knew Lord Arryn well . Fast friends , they were . ";Ned;Lord,;0.2;5830;182
Jory snorted . " The Hand always gave the lads a copper on their name days , he says . Had a way with horses . Never rode his mounts too hard , and brought them carrots and apples , so they were always pleased to see him . ";Jory;Ned,;0.104166666667;5831;182
" Carrots and apples , " Ned repeated .;Ned;Jory,;0.0;5832;182
" Did our watchman recall anything else of note ? ";Lord;Ned,Jory,;0.0;5844;183
" The lad swears Lord Jon was as strong as a man half his age . Often went riding with Lord Stannis , he says . ";Jory;Jon,;0.133333333333;5845;183
He had given no word as to when he might return . " Where did they go on these rides ? ";Ned;Lord,Jory,;0.0;5850;183
" The boy says that they visited a brothel . ";Jory;Lord,Ned,;0.0;5852;183
" A brothel ? ";Lord;Ned,Jory,;0.0;5853;183
Ned said . " The Lord of the Eyrie and Hand of the King visited a brothel with Stannis Baratheon ? ";Ned;King,;0.0;5854;183
" The boy insists it 's true . The Hand took three guardsmen with him , and the boy says they were joking of it when he took their horses afterward . ";Jory;Lord,Ned,;0.35;5857;183
" Which brothel ? ";Ned;Lord,Jory,;0.0;5858;183
" The boy did not know . The guards would . ";Jory;Lord,Ned,;0.0;5860;183
" A pity Lysa carried them off to the Vale , " Ned said dryly . " The gods are doing their best to vex us . Lady Lysa , Maester Colemon , Lord Stannis ... everyone who might actually know the truth of what happened to Jon Arryn is a thousand leagues away . ";Ned;Lysa,Jon,;1.0;5861;183
" Will you summon Lord Stannis back from Dragonstone ? ";Jory;Stannis,;0.0;5862;183
" Not yet , " Ned said . " Not until I have a better notion of what this is all about and where he stands . ";Ned;Lord,Jory,;0.5;5863;183
" Bring me my doublet , if you would . The grey , with the direwolf sigil . I want this armorer to know who I am . It might make him more forthcoming . ";Lord;Ned,Jory,;0.225;5869;183
Jory went to the wardrobe . " Lord Renly is brother to Lord Stannis as well as the king . ";Jory;Lord,;0.0;5870;183
" Yet it seems that he was not invited on these rides . ";Lord;Ned,Jory,;0.0;5871;183
The maid was Loras Tyrell 's sister Margaery , he'd confessed , but there were those who said she looked like Lyanna . " No , " Ned had told him , bemused .;Ned;Lord,Jory,;0.0;5876;183
Jory held out the doublet , and Ned slid his hands through the armholes . " Perhaps Lord Stannis will return for Robert 's tourney , " he said as Jory laced the garment up the back .;Jory;Lord,;0.0;5879;183
" That would be a stroke of fortune , my lord , " Jory said .;Jory;Lord,Ned,;0.0;5880;183
Ned buckled on a longsword . " In other words , not bloody likely . ";Ned;Lord,Jory,;-0.308333333333;5881;183
Jory draped Ned 's cloak across his shoulders and clasped it at the throat with the Hand 's badge of office . " The armorer lives above his shop , in a large house at the top of the Street of Steel . Alyn knows the way , my lord . ";Jory;Alyn,;0.238095238095;5883;183
Ned nodded . " The gods help this potboy if he 's sent me off haring after shadows . ";Ned;Lord,Jory,;0.0;5884;183
" Is there any other service I might perform ? ";Jory;Lord,Ned,;-0.125;5890;183
" I suppose you'd best begin visiting whorehouses . ";Ned;Lord,Jory,;1.0;5891;183
" Hard duty , my lord . ";Lord;Ned,Jory,;-0.291666666667;5892;183
Jory grinned . " The men will be glad to help . Porther has made a fair start already . ";Jory;Port,;0.6;5893;183
In the shadow of the wall , farmers stood beside their wagons , bellowing out , " Apples , the best apples , cheap at twice the price , " and " Blood melons , sweet as honey , " and " Turnips , onions , roots , here you go here , here you go , turnips , onions , roots , here you go here . ";Gate;Lord,;0.583333333333;5906;184
The silk rippled in the wind like a living thing ; across the fabric was blazoned a night sky slashed with purple lightning . " Make way for Lord Beric ! ";Gate;Lord,;0.0;5910;184
the rider shouted . " Make way for Lord Beric ! ";Gate;Lord,;0.0;5911;184
And close behind came the young lord himself , a dashing figure on a black courser , with red-gold hair and a black satin cloak dusted with stars . " Here to fight in the Hand 's tourney , my lord ? ";Gate;Lord,;-0.158333333333;5912;184
a guardsman called out to him . " Here to win the Hand 's tourney , " Lord Beric shouted back as the crowd cheered .;Lord;Gate,;0.4;5913;184
The slim young serving girl took quick note of Ned 's badge and the sigil on his doublet , and the master came hurrying out , all smiles and bows . " Wine for the King 's Hand , " he told the girl , gesturing Ned to a couch . " I am Tobho Mott , my lord , please , please , put yourself at ease . ";Ned;Tobho,;0.216666666667;5920;185
Around his neck was a heavy silver chain and a sapphire as large as a pigeon 's egg . " If you are in need of new arms for the Hand 's tourney , you have come to the right shop . ";Ned;;0.109090909091;5922;185
Ned did not bother to correct him . " My work is costly , and I make no apologies for that , my lord , " he said as he filled two matching silver goblets . " You will not find craftsmanship equal to mine anywhere in the Seven Kingdoms , I promise you . Visit every forge in King 's Landing if you like , and compare for yourself . Any village smith can hammer out a shirt of mail ; my work is art . ";Ned;;0.2;5923;185
Only a man who knew the spells could take old weapons and forge them anew . " The direwolf is the sigil of House Stark , is it not ? I could fashion a direwolf helm so real that children will run from you in the street , " he vowed .;Tobho;Ned,Robb,;0.0;5930;186
Ned smiled . " Did you make a falcon helm for Lord Arryn ? ";Ned;Tobho,Robb,;0.6;5931;186
Tobho Mott paused a long moment and set aside his wine . " The Hand did call upon me , with Lord Stannis , the king 's brother . I regret to say , they did not honor me with their patronage . ";Tobho;Ned,Robb,;-0.05;5932;186
" They asked to see the boy , " the armorer said , " so I took them back to the forge . ";Robb;Ned,Tobho,;0.0;5936;186
" The boy , " Ned echoed .;Ned;Tobho,Robb,;0.0;5937;186
He had no notion who the boy might be . " I should like to see the boy as well . ";Robb;Ned,Tobho,;0.0;5938;186
Tobho Mott gave him a cool , careful look . " As you wish , my lord , " he said with no trace of his former friendliness .;Tobho;Ned,Robb,;0.0833333333333;5939;186
The master called over a tall lad about Robb 's age , his arms and chest corded with muscle . " This is Lord Stark , the new Hand of the King , " he told him as the boy looked at Ned through sullen blue eyes and pushed back sweat-soaked hair with his fingers .;Robb;Lord,;-0.0159090909091;5944;186
The shadow of a new beard darkened his jaw . " This is Gendry . Strong for his age , and he works hard . Show the Hand that helmet you made , lad . ";Tobho;Gendry,;0.0926767676768;5946;186
It was raw steel , unpolished but expertly shaped . " This is fine work . I would be pleased if you would let me buy it . ";Ned;Tobho,Robb,;0.228632478632;5949;186
The boy snatched it out of his hands . " It 's not for sale . ";Robb;Ned,Tobho,;0.0;5950;186
Tobho Mott looked horror-struck . " Boy , this is the King 's Hand . If his lordship wants this helm , make him a gift of it . He honors you by asking . ";Tobho;King,;0.2;5951;186
" I made it for me , " the boy said stubbornly .;Robb;Ned,Tobho,;0.0;5952;186
" A hundred pardons , my lord , " his master said hurriedly to Ned . " The boy is crude as new steel , and like new steel would profit from some beating . That helm is journeyman 's work at best . Forgive him and I promise I will craft you a helm like none you have ever seen . ";Ned;Tobho,Robb,;0.143181818182;5953;186
" He 's done nothing that requires my forgiveness . Gendry , when Lord Arryn came to see you , what did you talk about ? ";Tobho;Lord,;0.0;5954;186
" He asked me questions is all , m'lord . ";Ned;Tobho,Robb,;0.0;5955;186
" What sort of questions ? ";Tobho;Ned,Robb,;0.0;5956;186
The boy shrugged . " How was I , and was I well treated , and if I liked the work , and stuff about my mother . Who she was and what she looked like and all . ";Robb;Ned,Tobho,;0.6;5957;186
" What did you tell him ? ";Ned;Tobho,Robb,;0.0;5958;186
The boy shoved a fresh fall of black hair off his forehead . " She died when I was little . She had yellow hair , and sometimes she used to sing to me , I remember . She worked in an alehouse . ";Tobho;Ned,Robb,;-0.0135416666667;5960;186
" Did Lord Stannis question you as well ? ";Ned;Tobho,Robb,;0.0;5961;186
" The bald one ? No , not him . He never said no word , just glared at me , like I was some raper who done for his daughter . ";Tobho;Ned,Robb,;0.0;5962;186
" Mind your filthy tongue , " the master said . " This is the King 's own Hand . ";Ned;King,;-0.1;5963;186
The boy lowered his eyes . " A smart boy , but stubborn . That helm ... the others call him bullheaded , so he threw it in their teeth . ";Tobho;Ned,Robb,;0.214285714286;5964;186
Ned touched the boy 's head , fingering the thick black hair . " Look at me , Gendry . ";Ned;Tobho,Robb,;-0.233333333333;5965;186
Yes , he thought , I see it . " Go back to your work , lad . I 'm sorry to have bothered you . ";Tobho;Ned,Robb,;-0.25;5968;186
He walked back to the house with the master . " Who paid the boy 's apprentice fee ? ";Ned;Tobho,Robb,;0.0;5969;186
Mott looked fretful . " You saw the boy . Such a strong boy . Those hands of his , those hands were made for hammers . He had such promise , I took him on without a fee . ";Tobho;Ned,Robb,;0.144444444444;5971;186
" The truth now , " Ned urged . " The streets are full of strong boys . The day you take on an apprentice without a fee will be the day the Wall comes down . Who paid for him ? ";Ned;King,;0.209259259259;5972;186
" A lord , " the master said reluctantly . " He gave no name , and wore no sigil on his coat . He paid in gold , twice the customary sum , and said he was paying once for the boy , and once for my silence . ";Tobho;Ned,Robb,;0.0;5973;186
" Describe him . ";Ned;Tobho,Robb,;0.0;5974;186
" He was stout , round of shoulder , not so tall as you . Brown beard , but there was a bit of red in it , I 'll swear . He wore a rich cloak , that I do remember , heavy purple velvet worked with silver threads , but the hood shadowed his face and I never did see him clear . ";Tobho;Ned,Robb,;0.015;5975;186
He hesitated a moment . " My lord , I want no trouble . ";Robb;Ned,Tobho,;0.0;5976;186
" None of us wants trouble , but I fear these are troubled times , Master Mott , " Ned said . " You know who the boy is . ";Ned;Tobho,Robb,;-0.15;5977;186
" I am only an armorer , my lord . I know what I 'm told . ";Tobho;Ned,Robb,;0.0;5978;186
" You know who the boy is , " Ned repeated patiently . " That is not a question . ";Ned;Tobho,Robb,;0.0;5979;186
" The boy is my apprentice , " the master said .;Tobho;Ned,Robb,;0.0;5980;186
He looked Ned in the eye , stubborn as old iron . " Who he was before he came to me , that 's none of my concern . ";Ned;Tobho,Robb,;0.1;5981;186
He decided that he liked Tobho Mott , master armorer . " If the day ever comes when Gendry would rather wield a sword than forge one , send him to me . He has the look of a warrior . Until then , you have my thanks , Master Mott , and my promise . Should I ever want a helm to frighten children , this will be the first place I visit . ";Tobho;Gendry,;0.35;5983;186
His guard was waiting outside with the horses . " Did you find anything , my lord ? ";Robb;Ned,Tobho,;0.0;5984;186
" I did , " Ned told him , wondering .;Ned;Tobho,Robb,;0.0;5986;186
" My lady , you ought cover your head , " Ser Rodrik told her as their horses plodded north . " You will take a chill . ";Rodrik;Catelyn,;0.0;5991;187
" It is only water , Ser Rodrik , " Catelyn replied .;Catelyn;Rodrik,;0.0;5992;187
" I am soaked through , " Ser Rodrik complained . " Even my bones are wet . ";Rodrik;Catelyn,;-0.2;6005;188
The woods pressed close around them , and the steady pattering of rain on leaves was accompanied by the small sucking sounds their horses made as their hooves pulled free of the mud . " We will want a fire tonight , my lady , and a hot meal would serve us both . ";Rodrik;Catelyn,;0.141666666667;6006;188
" There is an inn at the crossroads up ahead , " Catelyn told him .;Catelyn;Rodrik,;0.0;6007;188
" An inn , " Ser Rodrik repeated wistfully . " If only ... but we dare not risk it . If we wish to remain unknown , I think it best we seek out some small holdfast ... ";Rodrik;Catelyn,;0.1625;6013;188
He broke off as they heard sounds up the road ; splashing water , the clink of mail , a horse 's whinny . " Riders , " he warned , his hand dropping to the hilt of his sword .;Rodrik;Catelyn,;0.0;6014;188
The banner in the hand of the foremost rider hung sodden and limp , but the guardsmen wore indigo cloaks and on their shoulders flew the silver eagle of Seagard . " Mallisters , " Ser Rodrik whispered to her , as if she had not known . " My lady , best pull up your hood . ";Rodrik;Catelyn,;0.4;6018;188
" He did not know you , " Ser Rodrik said after , wondering .;Rodrik;Masha,;0.0;6030;189
" He saw a pair of mud-spattered travelers by the side of the road , wet and tired . It would never occur to him to suspect that one of them was the daughter of his liege lord . I think we shall be safe enough at the inn , Ser Rodrik . ";Rodrik;Masha,;0.0;6031;189
Masha Heddle was fatter and greyer than Catelyn remembered , still chewing her sourleaf , but she gave them only the most cursory of looks , with nary a hint of her ghastly red smile . " Two rooms at the top of the stair , that 's all there is , " she said , chewing all the while . " They 're under the bell tower , you wo n't be missing meals , though there 's some thinks it too noisy . Ca n't be helped . We 're full up , or near as makes no matter . It 's those rooms or the road . ";Masha;Rodrik,;0.19375;6033;189
It was those rooms , low , dusty garrets at the top of a cramped narrow staircase . " Leave your boots down here , " Masha told them after she'd taken their coin . " The boy will clean them . I wo n't have you tracking mud up my stairs . Mind the bell . Those who come late to meals do n't eat . ";Masha;Rodrik,;-0.0269841269841;6034;189
Ser Rodrik came for her just as the bell ceased its clangor . " We had best make haste if we hope to eat tonight , my lady . ";Rodrik;Catelyn,;1.0;6071;190
" It might be safer if we were not knight and lady until we pass the Neck , " she told him . " Common travelers attract less notice . A father and daughter taken to the road on some family business , say . ";Rodrik;Neck,;-0.233333333333;6072;190
" As you say , my lady , " Ser Rodrik agreed .;Rodrik;Catelyn,;0.0;6073;190
It was only when she laughed that he realized what he'd done . " The old courtesies die hard , my-my daughter . ";Rodrik;Catelyn,;0.127083333333;6074;190
Catelyn took his arm . " Come , Father , " she said . " You 'll find that Masha Heddle sets a good table , I think , but try not to praise her . You truly do n't want to see her smile . ";Catelyn;Masha,;0.475;6076;190
Across the table a handsome youth was fingering a woodharp . " Seven blessings to you , goodfolk , " he said as they sat .;Rodrik;Catelyn,Winterfell,Marillion,Masha,Lannister,;0.5;6087;191
" And to you , singer , " Catelyn returned .;Catelyn;Rodrik,Winterfell,Marillion,Masha,Lannister,;0.0;6089;191
The singer , a youth of some eighteen years , eyed them boldly and asked where they were going , and from whence they had come , and what news they had , letting the questions fly as quick as arrows and never pausing for an answer . " We left King 's Landing a fortnight ago , " Catelyn replied , answering the safest of his questions .;Catelyn;King,;0.377777777778;6091;191
" That 's where I 'm bound , " the youth said .;Rodrik;Catelyn,Winterfell,Marillion,Masha,Lannister,;0.0;6092;191
Singers loved nothing half so well as the sound of their own voices . " The Hand 's tourney means rich lords with fat purses . The last time I came away with more silver than I could carry ... or would have , if I had n't lost it all betting on the Kingslayer to win the day . ";Catelyn;Rodrik,Winterfell,Marillion,Masha,Lannister,;0.401041666667;6094;191
" The gods frown on the gambler , " Ser Rodrik said sternly .;Rodrik;Catelyn,Winterfell,Marillion,Masha,Lannister,;0.0;6095;191
" They frowned on me , for certain , " the singer said . " Your cruel gods and the Knight of Flowers altogether did me in . ";Catelyn;Flowers,;-0.392857142857;6097;191
" No doubt that was a lesson for you , " Ser Rodrik said .;Rodrik;Catelyn,Winterfell,Marillion,Masha,Lannister,;0.0;6098;191
" It was . This time my coin will champion Ser Loras . ";Catelyn;Loras,;0.0;6099;191
" My name is Marillion , " the singer said , plucking a string on his woodharp . " Doubtless you 've heard me play somewhere ? ";Rodrik;Marillion,;0.0;6104;191
Few wandering singers ever ventured as far north as Winterfell , but she knew his like from her girlhood in Riverrun . " I fear not , " she told him .;Winterfell;Catelyn,Rodrik,Marillion,Masha,Lannister,;-0.05;6106;191
He drew a plaintive chord from the woodharp . " That is your loss , " he said . " Who was the finest singer you 've ever heard ? ";Catelyn;Rodrik,Winterfell,Marillion,Masha,Lannister,;0.0;6107;191
" Alia of Braavos , " Ser Rodrik answered at once .;Rodrik;Catelyn,Winterfell,Marillion,Masha,Lannister,;0.0;6108;191
" Oh , I 'm much better than that old stick , " Marillion said . " If you have the silver for a song , I 'll gladly show you . ";Marillion;Catelyn,Rodrik,Winterfell,Masha,Lannister,;0.3;6109;191
" I might have a copper or two , but I'd sooner toss it down a well than pay for your howling , " Ser Rodrik groused .;Rodrik;I'd,;-0.155555555556;6110;191
" Your grandfather has a sour nature , " Marillion said to Catelyn . " I meant to do you honor . An homage to your beauty . In truth , I was made to sing for kings and high lords . ";Marillion;Catelyn,Rodrik,Winterfell,Masha,Lannister,;0.16;6112;191
" Oh , I can see that , " Catelyn said . " Lord Tully is fond of song , I hear . No doubt you 've been to Riverrun . ";Catelyn;Lord,;0.0;6113;191
" A hundred times , " the singer said airily . " They keep a chamber for me , and the young lord is like a brother . ";Rodrik;Catelyn,Winterfell,Marillion,Masha,Lannister,;0.1;6114;191
Another singer had once bedded a girl her brother fancied ; he had hated the breed ever since . " And Winterfell ? ";Catelyn;Rodrik,Winterfell,Marillion,Masha,Lannister,;-0.9;6116;191
she asked him . " Have you traveled north ? ";Rodrik;Catelyn,Winterfell,Marillion,Masha,Lannister,;0.0;6117;191
" Why would I ? ";Catelyn;Rodrik,Winterfell,Marillion,Masha,Lannister,;0.0;6118;191
Marillion asked . " It 's all blizzards and bearskins up there , and the Starks know no music but the howling of wolves . ";Marillion;Catelyn,Rodrik,Winterfell,Masha,Lannister,;0.0;6119;191
" Innkeep , " a servant 's voice called out behind her , " we have horses that want stabling , and my lord of Lannister requires a room and a hot bath . ";Catelyn;Lannister,;-0.075;6121;191
" Oh , gods , " Ser Rodrik said before Catelyn reached out to silence him , her fingers tightening hard around his forearm .;Rodrik;Catelyn,Winterfell,Marillion,Masha,Lannister,;-0.291666666667;6122;191
Masha Heddle was bowing and smiling her hideous red smile . " I 'm sorry , m'lord , truly , we 're full up , every room . ";Masha;Catelyn,Rodrik,Winterfell,Marillion,Lannister,;0.0375;6123;191
and him , standing there small and bold as life . " My men will sleep in your stable , and as for myself , well , I do not require a large room , as you can plainly see . ";Catelyn;Rodrik,Winterfell,Marillion,Masha,Lannister,;0.0992063492063;6126;191
He flashed a mocking grin . " So long as the fire 's warm and the straw reasonably free of fleas , I am a happy man . ";Rodrik;Catelyn,Winterfell,Marillion,Masha,Lannister,;0.4375;6127;191
Masha Heddle was beside herself . " M'lord , there 's nothing , it 's the tourney , there 's no help for it , oh ... ";Masha;Catelyn,Rodrik,Winterfell,Marillion,Lannister,;0.0;6128;191
A freerider in a faded blue cloak lurched to his feet . " You 're welcome to my room , m'lord . ";Catelyn;Rodrik,Winterfell,Marillion,Masha,Lannister,;0.4;6131;191
" Now there 's a clever man , " Lannister said as he sent the coin spinning across the room .;Lannister;Catelyn,Rodrik,Winterfell,Marillion,Masha,;0.166666666667;6132;191
The freerider snatched it from the air . " And a nimble one to boot . ";Catelyn;Rodrik,Winterfell,Marillion,Masha,Lannister,;0.0;6133;191
The dwarf turned back to Masha Heddle . " You will be able to manage food , I trust ? ";Masha;Catelyn,Rodrik,Winterfell,Marillion,Lannister,;0.25;6134;191
" Anything you like , m'lord , anything at all , " the innkeep promised .;Catelyn;Rodrik,Winterfell,Marillion,Masha,Lannister,;0.0;6135;191
Lannister glanced at the nearest tables . " My men will have whatever you 're serving these people . Double portions , we 've had a long hard ride . I 'll take a roast fowl-chicken , duck , pigeon , it makes no matter . And send up a flagon of your best wine . Yoren , will you sup with me ? ";Lannister;Catelyn,Rodrik,Winterfell,Marillion,Masha,;0.164583333333;6137;191
" Aye , m'lord , I will , " the black brother replied .;Rodrik;Catelyn,Winterfell,Marillion,Masha,Lannister,;-0.166666666667;6138;191
The dwarf had not so much as glanced toward the far end of the room , and Catelyn was thinking how grateful she was for the crowded benches between them when suddenly Marillion bounded to his feet . " My lord of Lannister ! ";Catelyn;Rodrik,Winterfell,Marillion,Masha,Lannister,;0.125;6139;191
he called out . " I would be pleased to entertain you while you eat . Let me sing you the lay of your father 's great victory at King 's Landing ! ";Rodrik;Catelyn,Winterfell,Marillion,Masha,Lannister,;0.8125;6140;191
" Nothing would be more likely to ruin my supper , " the dwarf said dryly .;Catelyn;Rodrik,Winterfell,Marillion,Masha,Lannister,;0.25;6141;191
The dwarf was smiling . " Lady Stark , what an unexpected pleasure , " he said . " I was sorry to miss you at Winterfell . ";Rodrik;Winterfell,;-0.2;6146;191
" Lady ... Stark ? ";Masha;Catelyn,Rodrik,Winterfell,Marillion,Lannister,;-0.2;6150;191
" I was still Catelyn Tully the last time I bedded here , " she told the innkeep .;Rodrik;Catelyn,Winterfell,Marillion,Masha,Lannister,;0.0;6152;191
There was no time to think it through , only the moment and the sound of her own voice ringing in her ears . " You in the corner , " she said to an older man she had not noticed until now . " Is that the black bat of Harrenhal I see embroidered on your surcoat , ser ? ";Catelyn;Rodrik,Winterfell,Marillion,Masha,Lannister,;0.2;6156;191
The man got to his feet . " It is , my lady . ";Rodrik;Catelyn,Winterfell,Marillion,Masha,Lannister,;0.0;6157;191
" And is Lady Whent a true and honest friend to my father , Lord Hoster Tully of Riverrun ? ";Catelyn;Lady,;0.475;6158;191
" She is , " the man replied stoutly .;Rodrik;Catelyn,Winterfell,Marillion,Masha,Lannister,;0.0;6159;191
" The red stallion was ever a welcome sight in Riverrun , " she said to the trio by the fire . " My father counts Jonos Bracken among his oldest and most loyal bannermen . ";Catelyn;Rodrik,Winterfell,Marillion,Masha,Lannister,;0.408333333333;6162;191
The three men-at-arms exchanged uncertain looks . " Our lord is honored by his trust , " one of them said hesitantly .;Rodrik;Catelyn,Winterfell,Marillion,Masha,Lannister,;0.0;6163;191
" I envy your father all these fine friends , " Lannister quipped , " but I do not quite see the purpose of this , Lady Stark . ";Lannister;Catelyn,Rodrik,Winterfell,Marillion,Masha,;0.108333333333;6164;191
They were the heart of the matter ; there were more than twenty of them . " I know your sigil as well : the twin towers of Frey . How fares your good lord , sers ? ";Catelyn;Rodrik,Winterfell,Marillion,Masha,Lannister,;0.575;6166;191
Their captain rose . " Lord Walder is well , my lady . He plans to take a new wife on his ninetieth name day , and has asked your lord father to honor the wedding with his presence . ";Rodrik;Lord,;0.368181818182;6167;191
That was when Catelyn knew he was hers . " This man came a guest into my house , and there conspired to murder my son , a boy of seven , " she proclaimed to the room at large , pointing .;Catelyn;Rodrik,Winterfell,Marillion,Masha,Lannister,;0.214285714286;6169;191
Ser Rodrik moved to her side , his sword in hand . " In the name of King Robert and the good lords you serve , I call upon you to seize him and help me return him to Winterfell to await the king 's justice . ";Rodrik;Catelyn,Winterfell,Marillion,Masha,Lannister,;0.65;6170;191
" It is better than the songs , " she whispered when they found the places that her father had promised her , among the high lords and ladies .;Sansa;;0.33;6180;192
Sansa remembered Lord Yohn Royce , who had guested at Winterfell two years before . " His armor is bronze , thousands and thousands of years old , engraved with magic runes that ward him against harm , " she whispered to Jeyne .;Sansa;;0.3;6186;192
The Hound entered the lists as well , and so too the king 's brother , handsome Lord Renly of Storm 's End. Jory , Alyn , and Harwin rode for Winterfell and the north . " Jory looks a beggar among these others , " Septa Mordane sniffed when he appeared .;Hound;Jory,;0.5;6199;193
To the other maidens he had given white roses , but the one he plucked for her was red . " Sweet lady , " he said , " no victory is half so beautiful as you . ";Sansa;Mordane,;0.151388888889;6256;194
He was short , with a pointed beard and a silver streak in his hair , almost as old as her father . " You must be one of her daughters , " he said to her .;Sansa;Mordane,;0.05;6261;194
He had grey-green eyes that did not smile when his mouth did . " You have the Tully look . ";Sansa;Mordane,;0.3;6262;194
" I 'm Sansa Stark , " she said , ill at ease .;Sansa;Sansa,;-0.35;6263;194
The man wore a heavy cloak with a fur collar , fastened with a silver mockingbird , and he had the effortless manner of a high lord , but she did not know him . " I have not had the honor , my lord . ";Sansa;Mordane,;-0.02;6264;194
Septa Mordane quickly took a hand . " Sweet child , this is Lord Petyr Baelish , of the king 's small council . ";Mordane;Lord,;0.05;6265;194
" Your mother was my queen of beauty once , " the man said quietly .;Sansa;Mordane,;0.0;6266;194
His breath smelled of mint . " You have her hair . ";Sansa;Mordane,;0.0;6267;194
Instead Joffrey smiled and kissed her hand , handsome and gallant as any prince in the songs , and said , " Ser Loras has a keen eye for beauty , sweet lady . ";Joffrey;Loras,;0.483333333333;6285;195
" He was too kind , " she demurred , trying to remain modest and calm , though her heart was singing . " Ser Loras is a true knight . Do you think he will win tomorrow , my lord ? ";Joffrey;Loras,;0.43;6286;195
" No , " Joffrey said . " My dog will do for him , or perhaps my uncle Jaime . And in a few years , when I am old enough to enter the lists , I shall do for them all . ";Joffrey;;-0.0333333333333;6287;195
Now everybody heard him . " No , " he thundered in a voice that drowned out all other speech .;Cersei;;-0.125;6312;196
He had a goblet of wine in one hand , and he was drunk as a man could be . " You do not tell me what to do , woman , " he screamed at Queen Cersei . " I am king here , do you understand ? I rule here , and if I say that I will fight tomorrow , I will fight ! ";Cersei;;-0.625;6314;196
The king guffawed . " The great knight . I can still knock you in the dirt . Remember that , Kingslayer . ";Lannister;Lord,Sansa,Mordane,Joffrey,;0.8;6321;197
He slapped his chest with the jeweled goblet , splashing wine all over his satin tunic . " Give me my hammer and not a man in the realm can stand before me ! ";Sansa;Lannister,Lord,Mordane,Joffrey,;0.0;6322;197
Jaime Lannister rose and brushed himself off . " As you say , Your Grace . ";Lannister;Lord,Sansa,Mordane,Joffrey,;0.3;6323;197
Lord Renly came forward , smiling . " You 've spilled your wine , Robert . Let me bring you a fresh goblet . ";Lord;Lannister,Sansa,Mordane,Joffrey,;0.3;6325;197
Sansa started as Joffrey laid his hand on her arm . " It grows late , " the prince said .;Sansa;Lannister,Lord,Mordane,Joffrey,;-0.3;6326;197
He had a queer look on his face , as if he were not seeing her at all . " Do you need an escort back to the castle ? ";Lannister;Lord,Sansa,Mordane,Joffrey,;0.0;6327;197
" No , " Sansa began .;Sansa;Lannister,Lord,Mordane,Joffrey,;0.0;6328;197
She looked for Septa Mordane , and was startled to find her with her head on the table , snoring soft and ladylike snores . " I mean to say ... yes , thank you , that would be most kind . I am tired , and the way is so dark . I should be glad for some protection . ";Mordane;Lannister,Lord,Sansa,Joffrey,;0.119642857143;6329;197
Joffrey called out , " Dog ! ";Joffrey;Lannister,Lord,Sansa,Mordane,;0.0;6330;197
The light of the torches made his burned face shine a dull red . " Yes , Your Grace ? ";Sansa;Lannister,Lord,Mordane,Joffrey,;0.0361111111111;6333;197
" Take my betrothed back to the castle , and see that no harm befalls her , " the prince told him brusquely .;Lannister;Lord,Sansa,Mordane,Joffrey,;0.0;6335;197
Sansa could feel the Hound watching her . " Did you think Joff was going to take you himself ? ";Sansa;Joffrey,;0.0;6337;197
He had a laugh like the snarling of dogs in a pit . " Small chance of that . ";Lannister;Lord,Sansa,Mordane,Joffrey,;0.025;6339;197
He pulled her unresisting to her feet . " Come , you 're not the only one needs sleep . I 've drunk too much , and I may need to kill my brother tomorrow . ";Sansa;Lannister,Lord,Mordane,Joffrey,;-0.133333333333;6340;197
A true lady would not notice his face , she told herself . " You rode gallantly today , Ser Sandor , " she made herself say .;Hound;Clegane,Sansa,;0.35;6351;198
Sandor Clegane snarled at her . " Spare me your empty little compliments , girl ... and your ser ' s. I am no knight . I spit on them and their vows . My brother is a knight . Did you see him ride today ? ";Clegane;Sansa,Hound,;-0.14375;6352;198
" Yes , " Sansa whispered , trembling . " He was ... ";Sansa;Clegane,Hound,;0.0;6353;198
" Gallant ? ";Clegane;Sansa,Hound,;0.0;6354;198
He was mocking her , she realized . " No one could withstand him , " she managed at last , proud of herself .;Hound;Clegane,Sansa,;0.4;6356;198
She had no choice but to stop beside him . " Some septa trained you well . You 're like one of those birds from the Summer Isles , are n't you ? A pretty little talking bird , repeating all the pretty little words they taught you to recite . ";Sansa;Clegane,Hound,;0.03125;6359;198
" That 's unkind . ";Hound;Clegane,Sansa,;0.0;6360;198
Sansa could feel her heart fluttering in her chest . " You 're frightening me . I want to go now . ";Sansa;Clegane,Hound,;-0.5;6361;198
" No one could withstand him , " the Hound rasped . " That 's truth enough . No one could ever withstand Gregor . That boy today , his second joust , oh , that was a pretty bit of business . You saw that , did you ? Fool boy , he had no business riding in this company . No money , no squire , no one to help him with that armor . That gorget was n't fastened proper . You think Gregor did n't notice that ? You think Ser Gregor 's lance rode up by chance , do you ? Pretty little talking girl , you believe that , you 're empty-headed as a bird for true . Gregor 's lance goes where Gregor wants it to go . Look at me . Look at me ! ";Hound;Gregor,;0.119140625;6362;198
He squatted in front of her , and moved the torch close . " There 's a pretty for you . Take a good long stare . You know you want to . I 've watched you turning away all the way down the kingsroad . Piss on that . Take your look . ";Sansa;Clegane,Hound,;0.173611111111;6364;198
He let go of her then , and snuffed out the torch in the dirt . " No pretty words for that , girl ? No little compliment the septa taught you ? ";Sansa;;0.03125;6377;199
When there was no answer , he continued . " Most of them , they think it was some battle . A siege , a burning tower , an enemy with a torch . One fool asked if it was dragonsbreath . ";Sansa;;0.5;6378;199
His laugh was softer this time , but just as bitter . " I 'll tell you what it was , girl , " he said , a voice from the night , a shadow leaning so close now that she could smell the sour stench of wine on his breath . " I was younger than you , six , maybe seven . A woodcarver set up shop in the village under my father 's keep , and to buy favor he sent us gifts . The old man made marvelous toys . I do n't remember what I got , but it was Gregor 's gift I wanted . A wooden knight , all painted up , every joint pegged separate and fixed with strings , so you could make him fight . Gregor is five years older than me , the toy was nothing to him , he was already a squire , near six foot tall and muscled like an ox . So I took his knight , but there was no joy to it , I tell you . I was scared all the while , and true enough , he found me . There was a brazier in the room . Gregor never said a word , just picked me up under his arm and shoved the side of my face down in the burning coals and held me there while I screamed and screamed . You saw how strong he is . Even then , it took three grown men to drag him off me . The septons preach about the seven hells . What do they know ? Only a man who 's been burned knows what hell is truly like .;Sansa;Gregor,;0.206296296296;6379;199
" My father told everyone my bedding had caught fire , and our maester gave me ointments . Ointments ! Gregor got his ointments too . Four years later , they anointed him with the seven oils and he recited his knightly vows and Rhaegar Targaryen tapped him on the shoulder and said , ' Arise , Ser Gregor . ' ";Sansa;Gregor,Targaryen,;0.0;6380;199
She found his massive shoulder with her hand . " He was no true knight , " she whispered to him .;Sansa;Hound,;0.175;6387;200
Sansa stumbled back , away from him , but he caught her arm . " No , " he growled at her , " no , little bird , he was no true knight . ";Sansa;Hound,;0.0541666666667;6389;200
" Thank you , my lord , " Sansa said meekly .;Sansa;Hound,;0.0;6395;200
The Hound caught her by the arm and leaned close . " The things I told you tonight , " he said , his voice sounding even rougher than usual . " If you ever tell Joffrey ... your sister , your father ... any of them ... ";Hound;Joffrey,;-0.25;6396;200
" I wo n't , " Sansa whispered . " I promise . ";Sansa;Hound,;0.0;6397;200
It was not enough . " If you ever tell anyone , " he finished , " I 'll kill you . ";Sansa;Hound,;0.0;6398;200
" I stood last vigil for him myself , " Ser Barristan Selmy said as they looked down at the body in the back of the cart . " He had no one else . A mother in the Vale , I am told . ";Serrett;Selmy,Ned,King,Robert,;-0.0518518518519;6402;201
" Hugh was Jon Arryn 's squire for four years , " Selmy went on . " The king knighted him before he rode north , in Jon 's memory . The lad wanted it desperately , yet I fear he was not ready . ";Selmy;Hugh,;0.2;6408;201
Ned had slept badly last night and he felt tired beyond his years . " None of us is ever ready , " he said .;Ned;Serrett,Selmy,King,Robert,;-0.0666666666667;6409;201
" For knighthood ? ";Serrett;Selmy,Ned,King,Robert,;0.0;6410;201
" For death . ";Ned;Serrett,Selmy,King,Robert,;0.0;6411;201
When his mother asked why her son was dead , he reflected bitterly , they would tell her he had fought to honor the King 's Hand , Eddard Stark . " This was needless . War should not be a game . ";King;Warden,;-0.325;6413;201
The silent sisters prepared men for the grave , and it was ill fortune to look on the face of death . " Send his armor home to the Vale . The mother will want to have it . ";Ned;Serrett,Selmy,King,Robert,;-0.25;6415;201
" It is worth a fair piece of silver , " Ser Barristan said . " The boy had it forged special for the tourney . Plain work , but good . I do not know if he had finished paying the smith . ";Serrett;Selmy,Ned,King,Robert,;0.358571428571;6416;201
" He paid yesterday , my lord , and he paid dearly , " Ned replied .;Ned;Serrett,Selmy,King,Robert,;0.0;6417;201
And to the silent sister he said , " Send the mother the armor . I will deal with this smith . ";Serrett;Selmy,Ned,King,Robert,;0.0;6418;201
A serving man with a goose under his arm bent his knee when he caught sight of them . " M'lords , " he muttered as the goose honked and pecked at his fingers .;Ned;Serrett,Selmy,King,Robert,;0.0;6424;201
" The king means to fight in the melee today , " Ser Barristan said as they were passing Ser Meryn 's shield , its paint sullied by a deep gash where Loras Tyrell 's lance had scarred the wood as he drove him from his saddle .;Serrett;Selmy,Ned,King,Robert,;0.0;6426;201
" Yes , " Ned said grimly .;Ned;Serrett,Selmy,King,Robert,;0.0;6427;201
Ser Barristan 's look was troubled . " They say night 's beauties fade at dawn , and the children of wine are oft disowned in the morning light . ";Serrett;Selmy,Ned,King,Robert,;-0.05;6430;201
" They say so , " Ned agreed , " but not of Robert . ";Ned;Serrett,Selmy,King,Robert,;0.0;6431;201
They found Robert drinking beer from a polished horn and roaring his displeasure at two young squires who were trying to buckle him into his armor . " Your Grace , " one was saying , almost in tears , " it 's made too small , it wo n't go . ";Serrett;Selmy,Ned,King,Robert,;-0.075;6437;201
" Seven hells ! ";Ned;Serrett,Selmy,King,Robert,;0.0;6439;201
Robert swore . " Do I have to do it myself ? Piss on the both of you . Pick it up . Do n't just stand there gaping , Lancel , pick it up ! ";Robert;Serrett,Selmy,Ned,King,;0.0;6440;201
The lad jumped , and the king noticed his company . " Look at these oafs , Ned . My wife insisted I take these two to squire for me , and they 're worse than useless . Ca n't even put a man 's armor on him properly . Squires , they say . I say they 're swineherds dressed up in silk . ";Serrett;Selmy,Ned,King,Robert,;-0.45;6441;201
Ned only needed a glance to understand the difficulty . " The boys are not at fault , " he told the king . " You 're too fat for your armor , Robert . ";Ned;Serrett,Selmy,King,Robert,;0.0;6442;201
Robert Baratheon took a long swallow of beer , tossed the empty horn onto his sleeping furs , wiped his mouth with the back of his hand , and said darkly , " Fat ? Fat , is it ? Is that how you speak to your king ? ";Robert;Serrett,Selmy,Ned,King,;-0.05;6443;201
He let go his laughter , sudden as a storm . " Ah , damn you , Ned , why are you always right ? ";Ned;Serrett,Selmy,King,Robert,;0.142857142857;6444;201
The squires smiled nervously until the king turned on them . " You . Yes , both of you . You heard the Hand . The king is too fat for his armor . Go find Ser Aron Santagar . Tell him I need the breastplate stretcher . Now ! What are you waiting for ? ";Robert;Aron,;0.75;6445;201
" Ah , I wish I could be there to see Santagar 's face , " Robert said . " I hope he 'll have the wit to send them to someone else . We ought to keep them running all day ! ";Robert;Aron,;0.0;6454;202
" Those boys , " Ned asked him . " Lannisters ? ";Ned;Robert,Serrett,Selmy,Joffrey,;0.0;6455;202
Robert nodded , wiping tears from his eyes . " Cousins . Sons of Lord Tywin 's brother . One of the dead ones . Or perhaps the live one , now that I come to think on it . I do n't recall . My wife comes from a very large family , Ned . ";Robert;Ned,Serrett,Selmy,Joffrey,;0.071645021645;6456;202
The Lannister appetite for offices and honors seemed to know no bounds . " The talk is you and the queen had angry words last night . ";Ned;Robert,Serrett,Selmy,Joffrey,;-0.25;6459;202
The mirth curdled on Robert 's face . " The woman tried to forbid me to fight in the melee . She 's sulking in the castle now , damn her . Your sister would never have shamed me like that . ";Robert;Ned,Serrett,Selmy,Joffrey,;0.0;6460;202
" You never knew Lyanna as I did , Robert , " Ned told him . " You saw her beauty , but not the iron underneath . She would have told you that you have no business in the melee . ";Ned;Lyanna,;0.0;6461;202
" You too ? ";Robert;Ned,Serrett,Selmy,Joffrey,;0.0;6462;202
The king frowned . " You are a sour man , Stark . Too long in the north , all the juices have frozen inside you . Well , mine are still running . ";Serrett;Robert,Ned,Selmy,Joffrey,;-0.125;6463;202
" You are the king , " Ned reminded him .;Ned;Robert,Serrett,Selmy,Joffrey,;0.0;6465;202
" I sit on the damn iron seat when I must . Does that mean I do n't have the same hungers as other men ? A bit of wine now and again , a girl squealing in bed , the feel of a horse between my legs ? Seven hells , Ned , I want to hit someone . ";Robert;Ned,Serrett,Selmy,Joffrey,;-0.145833333333;6466;202
Ser Barristan Selmy spoke up . " Your Grace , " he said , " it is not seemly that the king should ride into the melee . It would not be a fair contest . Who would dare strike you ? ";Serrett;Robert,Ned,Selmy,Joffrey,;0.7;6467;202
Robert seemed honestly taken aback . " Why , all of them , damn it . If they can . And the last man left standing ... ";Robert;Ned,Serrett,Selmy,Joffrey,;0.0;6468;202
" ... will be you , " Ned finished .;Ned;Robert,Serrett,Selmy,Joffrey,;0.0;6469;202
The dangers of the melee were only a savor to Robert , but this touched on his pride . " Ser Barristan is right . There 's not a man in the Seven Kingdoms who would dare risk your displeasure by hurting you . ";Robert;Serrett,;0.142857142857;6471;202
The king rose to his feet , his face flushed . " Are you telling me those prancing cravens will let me win ? ";Serrett;Robert,Ned,Selmy,Joffrey,;0.7;6472;202
" For a certainty , " Ned said , and Ser Barristan Selmy bowed his head in silent accord .;Ned;Robert,Serrett,Selmy,Joffrey,;0.0;6473;202
Selmy dodged . " Get out , " the king said then , coldly . " Get out before I kill you . ";Selmy;Robert,Ned,Serrett,Joffrey,;0.0;6477;202
Ned was about to follow when the king called out again . " Not you , Ned . ";Ned;Robert,Serrett,Selmy,Joffrey,;0.0;6479;202
Robert took up his horn again , filled it with beer from a barrel in the corner , and thrust it at Ned . " Drink , " he said brusquely .;Robert;Ned,Serrett,Selmy,Joffrey,;0.4;6481;202
" I 've no thirst - ";Ned;Robert,Serrett,Selmy,Joffrey,;0.0;6482;202
" Drink . Your king commands it . ";Serrett;Robert,Ned,Selmy,Joffrey,;0.0;6483;202
Robert sat down again . " Damn you , Ned Stark . You and Jon Arryn , I loved you both . What have you done to me ? You were the one should have been king , you or Jon . ";Robert;Ned,Serrett,Selmy,Joffrey,;0.114814814815;6486;202
" You had the better claim , Your Grace . ";Ned;Robert,Serrett,Selmy,Joffrey,;0.5;6487;202
" I told you to drink , not to argue . You made me king , you could at least have the courtesy to listen when I talk , damn you . Look at me , Ned . Look at what kinging has done to me . Gods , too fat for my armor , how did it ever come to this ? ";Robert;Ned,Serrett,Selmy,Joffrey,;-0.3;6488;202
" Robert ... ";Ned;Robert,Serrett,Selmy,Joffrey,;0.0;6489;202
" Drink and stay quiet , the king is talking . I swear to you , I was never so alive as when I was winning this throne , or so dead as now that I 've won it . And Cersei ... I have Jon Arryn to thank for her . I had no wish to marry after Lyanna was taken from me , but Jon said the realm needed an heir . Cersei Lannister would be a good match , he told me , she would bind Lord Tywin to me should Viserys Targaryen ever try to win back his father 's throne , " The king shook his head . " I loved that old man , I swear it , but now I think he was a bigger fool than Moon Boy . Oh , Cersei is lovely to look at , truly , but cold ... the way she guards her cunt , you'd think she had all the gold of Casterly Rock between her legs . Here , give me that beer if you wo n't drink it . ";Robert;Lyanna,Lannister,Viserys,Jon,Lord,Cersei,;0.2125;6490;202
He took the horn , upended it , belched , wiped his mouth . " I am sorry for your girl , Ned . Truly . About the wolf , I mean . My son was lying , I'd stake my soul on it . My son ... you love your children , do n't you ? ";Serrett;I'd,;-0.104166666667;6491;202
" With all my heart , " Ned said .;Ned;Robert,Serrett,Selmy,Joffrey,;0.0;6492;202
" Let me tell you a secret , Ned . More than once , I have dreamed of giving up the crown . Take ship for the Free Cities with my horse and my hammer , spend my time warring and whoring , that 's what I was made for . The sellsword king , how the singers would love me . You know what stops me ? The thought of Joffrey on the throne , with Cersei standing behind him whispering in his ear . My son . How could I have made a son like that , Ned ? ";Robert;Cersei,;0.12;6493;202
" He 's only a boy , " Ned said awkwardly .;Ned;Robert,Serrett,Selmy,Joffrey,;0.0;6494;202
He had small liking for Prince Joffrey , but he could hear the pain in Robert 's voice . " Have you forgotten how wild you were at his age ? ";Joffrey;Robert,Ned,Serrett,Selmy,;-0.075;6495;202
" It would not trouble me if the boy was wild , Ned . You do n't know him as I do . ";Robert;Ned,Serrett,Selmy,Joffrey,;0.1;6496;202
He sighed and shook his head . " Ah , perhaps you are right . Jon despaired of me often enough , yet I grew into a good king . ";Ned;Jon,;0.311904761905;6497;202
Robert looked at Ned and scowled at his silence . " You might speak up and agree now , you know . ";Robert;Ned,Serrett,Selmy,Joffrey,;0.0;6498;202
" Your Grace ... ";Ned;Robert,Serrett,Selmy,Joffrey,;0.0;6499;202
Robert slapped Ned on the back . " Ah , say that I 'm a better king than Aerys and be done with it . You never could lie for love nor honor , Ned Stark . I 'm still young , and now that you 're here with me , things will be different . We 'll make this a reign to sing of , and damn the Lannisters to seven hells . I smell bacon . Who do you think our champion will be today ? Have you seen Mace Tyrell 's boy ? The Knight of Flowers , they call him . Now there 's a son any man would be proud to own to . Last tourney , he dumped the Kingslayer on his golden rump , you ought to have seen the look on Cersei 's face . I laughed till my sides hurt . Renly says he has this sister , a maid of fourteen , lovely as a dawn ... ";Robert;Renly,Lannister,Tyrell,King,;0.316666666667;6501;202
The king 's melancholy melted away with the morning mist , and before long Robert was eating an orange and waxing fond about a morning at the Eyrie when they had been boys . " ... had given Jon a barrel of oranges , remember ? Only the things had gone rotten , so I flung mine across the table and hit Dacks right in the nose . You remember , Redfort 's pock-faced squire ? He tossed one back at me , and before Jon could so much as fart , there were oranges flying across the High Hall in every direction . ";Robert;Jon,;0.082619047619;6503;202
" A hundred golden dragons on the Kingslayer , " Littlefinger announced loudly as Jaime Lannister entered the lists , riding an elegant blood bay destrier .;Littlefinger;Lord,;0.4;6519;203
" Done , " Lord Renly shouted back . " The Hound has a hungry look about him this morning . ";Lord;Hound,;0.0;6522;203
" Even hungry dogs know better than to bite the hand that feeds them , " Littlefinger called dryly .;Littlefinger;Lord,;0.5;6523;203
" I wonder how I ought spend your money , " Littlefinger called down to Lord Renly .;Littlefinger;;-0.155555555556;6534;204
Sansa said , " I knew the Hound would win . ";Sansa;Hound,;0.8;6542;205
Littlefinger overheard . " If you know who 's going to win the second match , speak up now before Lord Renly plucks me clean , " he called to her .;Littlefinger;Sansa,Lord,;0.388888888889;6543;205
" A pity the Imp is not here with us , " Lord Renly said . " I should have won twice as much . ";Lord;Imp,;0.1;6545;205
When the Knight of Flowers made his entrance , a murmur ran through the crowd , and he heard Sansa 's fervent whisper , " Oh , he 's so beautiful . ";Flowers;;0.85;6567;206
Sansa clutched at his arm . " Father , do n't let Ser Gregor hurt him , " she said .;Sansa;Gregor,;0.0;6575;207
" These are tourney lances , " he told his daughter . " They make them to splinter on impact , so no one is hurt . ";Sansa;;0.0;6578;207
His face was dark with fury and his hair fell down into his eyes . " My sword , " he shouted to his squire , and the boy ran it out to him .;Gregor;;-0.152777777778;6597;208
By then Gregor was striding down the lists toward Ser Loras Tyrell , his bloody sword clutched in his fist . " Stop him ! ";Gregor;;-0.597222222222;6602;208
But as Gregor lifted his sword for the killing blow , a rasping voice warned , " Leave him be , " and a steel-clad hand wrenched him away from the boy .;Gregor;Robert,Serrett,Hound,Ned,;0.0;6611;209
He used that voice now . " STOP THIS MADNESS , " he boomed , " IN THE NAME OF YOUR KING ! ";Serrett;Gregor,Robert,Hound,Ned,;0.0;6617;209
Wordlessly , he turned and strode off , shoving past Barristan Selmy . " Let him go , " Robert said , and as quickly as that , it was over .;Robert;Gregor,Serrett,Hound,Ned,;-0.25;6621;209
" Is the Hound the champion now ? ";Serrett;Hound,;0.0;6622;209
" No , " he told her . " There will be one final joust , between the Hound and the Knight of Flowers . ";Gregor;Robert,Serrett,Hound,Ned,;0.0;6624;209
A few moments later Ser Loras Tyrell walked back onto the field in a simple linen doublet and said to Sandor Clegane , " I owe you my life . The day is yours , ser . ";Serrett;Gregor,Robert,Hound,Ned,;-0.05;6626;209
" I am no ser , " the Hound replied , but he took the victory , and the champion 's purse , and , for perhaps the first time in his life , the love of the commons .;Hound;Gregor,Robert,Serrett,Ned,;0.375;6627;209
As Ned walked with Sansa to the archery field , Littlefinger and Lord Renly and some of the others fell in with them . " Tyrell had to know the mare was in heat , " Littlefinger was saying . " I swear the boy planned the whole thing . Gregor has always favored huge , ill-tempered stallions with more spirit than sense . ";Ned;Tyrell,Gregor,;0.475;6629;209
It did not amuse Ser Barristan Selmy . " There is small honor in tricks , " the old man said stiffly .;Serrett;Gregor,Robert,Hound,Ned,;-0.075;6631;209
" Small honor and twenty thousand golds . ";Gregor;Robert,Serrett,Hound,Ned,;-0.25;6632;209
Jory brought Arya down to join them , and Sansa spoke to her sister pleasantly . " The tournament was magnificent , " she sighed . " You should have come . How was your dancing ? ";Jory;Arya,Sansa,Syrio,Ned,;0.422222222222;6645;210
" I 'm sore all over , " Arya reported happily , proudly displaying a huge purple bruise on her leg .;Arya;Jory,Sansa,Syrio,Ned,;0.4;6646;210
" You must be a terrible dancer , " Sansa said doubtfully .;Sansa;Jory,Arya,Syrio,Ned,;-1.0;6647;210
Later , while Sansa was off listening to a troupe of singers perform the complex round of interwoven ballads called the " Dance of the Dragons , " Ned inspected the bruise himself . " I hope Forel is not being too hard on you , " he said .;Sansa;Syrio,;-0.197916666667;6648;210
She was getting much better at that of late . " Syrio says that every hurt is a lesson , and every lesson makes you better . ";Arya;Syrio,;0.233333333333;6650;210
Before that , he had her doing spins and back flips . " Arya , are you certain you want to persist in this ? ";Syrio;Jory,Arya,Sansa,Ned,;0.107142857143;6655;210
She nodded . " Tomorrow we 're going to catch cats . ";Sansa;Jory,Arya,Syrio,Ned,;0.0;6656;210
" Cats . ";Arya;Jory,Sansa,Syrio,Ned,;0.0;6657;210
Ned sighed . " Perhaps it was a mistake to hire this Braavosi . If you like , I will ask Jory to take over your lessons . Or I might have a quiet word with Ser Barristan . He was the finest sword in the Seven Kingdoms in his youth . ";Ned;Braavos,;0.0;6658;210
" I do n't want them , " Arya said . " I want Syrio . ";Arya;Syrio,;0.0;6659;210
Any decent master-at-arms could give Arya the rudiments of slash-and-parry without this nonsense of blindfolds , cartwheels , and hopping about on one leg , but he knew his youngest daughter well enough to know there was no arguing with that stubborn jut of jaw . " As you wish , " he said .;Sansa;Jory,Arya,Syrio,Ned,;0.0833333333333;6661;210
Surely she would grow tired of this soon . " Try to be careful . ";Arya;Jory,Sansa,Syrio,Ned,;-0.25;6662;210
" I will , " she promised solemnly as she hopped smoothly from her right leg to her left .;Sansa;Jory,Arya,Syrio,Ned,;0.142857142857;6663;210
His musings were ended by a soft rap on his door . " A man to see you , my lord , " Harwin called . " He will not give his name . ";Harwin;Ned,Varys,moment,Stark,;0.1;6696;211
" Send him in , " Ned said , wondering .;Ned;Harwin,Varys,moment,Stark,;0.0;6697;211
" Who are you ? ";Varys;Harwin,Ned,moment,Stark,;0.0;6699;211
" A friend , " the cowled man said in a strange , low voice . " We must speak alone , Lord Stark . ";Ned;Harwin,Varys,moment,Stark,;-0.0833333333333;6701;211
Curiosity was stronger than caution . " Harwin , leave us , " he commanded .;Varys;Harwin,Ned,moment,Stark,;0.0;6702;211
" Lord Varys ? ";Ned;Harwin,Varys,moment,Stark,;0.0;6704;211
" Lord Stark , " Varys said politely , seating himself . " I wonder if I might trouble you for a drink ? ";Varys;Harwin,Ned,moment,Stark,;-0.2;6706;211
Ned filled two cups with summerwine and handed one to Varys . " I might have passed within a foot of you and never recognized you , " he said , incredulous .;Ned;Harwin,Varys,moment,Stark,;0.4;6707;211
" That was my dearest hope , " Varys said . " It would not do if certain people learned that we had spoken in private . The queen watches you closely . This wine is very choice . Thank you . ";Varys;Harwin,Ned,moment,Stark,;0.138095238095;6709;211
" How did you get past my other guards ? ";Ned;Harwin,Varys,moment,Stark,;-0.1875;6710;211
" The Red Keep has ways known only to ghosts and spiders . ";moment;Harwin,Ned,Varys,Stark,;0.0;6713;211
Varys smiled apologetically . " I will not keep you long , my lord . There are things you must know . You are the King 's Hand , and the king is a fool . ";Varys;King,;0.275;6714;211
The eunuch 's cloying tones were gone ; now his voice was thin and sharp as a whip . " Your friend , I know , yet a fool nonetheless ... and doomed , unless you save him . Today was a near thing . They had hoped to kill him during the melee . ";Ned;Harwin,Varys,moment,Stark,;-0.141666666667;6715;211
For a moment Ned was speechless with shock . " Who ? ";moment;Harwin,Ned,Varys,Stark,;0.0;6716;211
Varys sipped his wine . " If I truly need to tell you that , you are a bigger fool than Robert and I am on the wrong side . ";Varys;Harwin,Ned,moment,Stark,;-0.25;6717;211
" The Lannisters , " Ned said . " The queen ... no , I will not believe that , not even of Cersei . She asked him not to fight ! ";Ned;Harwin,Varys,moment,Stark,;0.0;6718;211
" She forbade him to fight , in front of his brother , his knights , and half the court . Tell me truly , do you know any surer way to force King Robert into the melee ? I ask you . ";Varys;King,;-0.166666666667;6719;211
The eunuch had hit upon a truth ; tell Robert Baratheon he could not , should not , or must not do a thing , and it was as good as done . " Even if he'd fought , who would have dared to strike the king ? ";Ned;Harwin,Varys,moment,Stark,;0.65;6721;211
Varys shrugged . " There were forty riders in the melee . The Lannisters have many friends . Amidst all that chaos , with horses screaming and bones breaking and Thoros of Myr waving that absurd firesword of his , who could name it murder if some chance blow felled His Grace ? ";Varys;Lannister,Myrcella,Grace,;0.0;6722;211
He went to the flagon and refilled his cup . " After the deed was done , the slayer would be beside himself with grief . I can almost hear him weeping . So sad . Yet no doubt the gracious and compassionate widow would take pity , lift the poor unfortunate to his feet , and bless him with a gentle kiss of forgiveness . Good King Joffrey would have no choice but to pardon him . ";Ned;Joffrey,;-0.225;6723;211
The eunuch stroked his cheek . " Or perhaps Cersei would let Ser Ilyn strike off his head . Less risk for the Lannisters that way , though quite an unpleasant surprise for their little friend . ";Varys;Cersei,;-0.334722222222;6724;211
Ned felt his anger rise . " You knew of this plot , and yet you did nothing . ";Ned;Harwin,Varys,moment,Stark,;-0.7;6725;211
" I command whisperers , not warriors . ";Varys;Harwin,Ned,moment,Stark,;0.0;6726;211
" You might have come to me earlier . ";Ned;Harwin,Varys,moment,Stark,;0.0;6727;211
" Oh , yes , I confess it . And you would have rushed straight to the king , yes ? And when Robert heard of his peril , what would he have done ? I wonder . ";Varys;Robert,;0.2;6728;211
Ned considered that . " He would have damned them all , and fought anyway , to show he did not fear them . ";Ned;Harwin,Varys,moment,Stark,;0.0;6729;211
Varys spread his hands . " I will make another confession , Lord Eddard . I was curious to see what you would do . Why not come to me ? you ask , and I must answer , Why , because I did not trust you , my lord . ";Varys;Harwin,Ned,moment,Stark,;-0.1;6730;211
" You did not trust me ? ";Ned;Harwin,Varys,moment,Stark,;0.0;6731;211
" The Red Keep shelters two sorts of people , Lord Eddard , " Varys said . " Those who are loyal to the realm , and those who are loyal only to themselves . Until this morning , I could not say which you might be ... so I waited to see ... and now I know , for a certainty . ";Varys;Harwin,Ned,moment,Stark,;0.166666666667;6733;211
He smiled a plump tight little smile , and for a moment his private face and public mask were one . " I begin to comprehend why the queen fears you so much . Oh , yes I do . ";moment;Harwin,Ned,Varys,Stark,;0.0905612244898;6734;211
" You are the one she ought to fear , " Ned said .;Ned;Harwin,Varys,moment,Stark,;0.0;6735;211
" No . I am what I am . The king makes use of me , but it shames him . A most puissant warrior is our Robert , and such a manly man has little love for sneaks and spies and eunuchs . If a day should come when Cersei whispers , ' Kill that man , ' Ilyn Payne will snick my head off in a twinkling , and who will mourn poor Varys then ? North or south , they sing no songs for spiders . ";Varys;Payne,Robert,Varys,;0.0825;6736;211
He reached out and touched Ned with a soft hand . " But you , Lord Stark ... I think ... no , I know ... he would not kill you , not even for his queen , and there may lie our salvation . ";Ned;Harwin,Varys,moment,Stark,;-0.05;6737;211
For a moment Eddard Stark wanted nothing so much as to return to Winterfell , to the clean simplicity of the north , where the enemies were winter and the wildlings beyond the Wall . " Surely Robert has other loyal friends , " he protested . " His brothers , his - ";Stark;Robert,;0.095;6739;211
" - wife ? ";Ned;Harwin,Varys,moment,Stark,;0.0;6740;211
Varys finished , with a smile that cut . " His brothers hate the Lannisters , true enough , but hating the queen and loving the king are not quite the same thing , are they ? Ser Barristan loves his honor , Grand Maester Pycelle loves his office , and Littlefinger loves Littlefinger . ";Varys;Serrett,Littlefinger,;0.135714285714;6741;211
" The Kingsguard - ";Ned;Harwin,Varys,moment,Stark,;0.0;6742;211
" A paper shield , " the eunuch said . " Try not to look so shocked , Lord Stark . Jaime Lannister is himself a Sworn Brother of the White Swords , and we all know what his oath is worth . The days when men like Ryam Redwyne and Prince Aemon the Dragonknight wore the white cloak are gone to dust and song . Of these seven , only Ser Barristan Selmy is made of the true steel , and Selmy is old . Ser Boros and Ser Meryn are the queen 's creatures to the bone , and I have deep suspicions of the others . No , my lord , when the swords come out in earnest , you will be the only true friend Robert Baratheon will have . ";Varys;Lannister,Dragon,Serrett,Robert,Brothers,;0.0181818181818;6743;211
" Robert must be told , " Ned said . " If what you say is true , if even a part of it is true , the king must hear it for himself . ";Ned;Robert,;0.35;6744;211
" And what proof shall we lay before him ? My words against theirs ? My little birds against the queen and the Kingslayer , against his brothers and his council , against the Wardens of East and West , against all the might of Casterly Rock ? Pray , send for Ser Ilyn directly , it will save us all some time . I know where that road ends . ";Varys;Harwin,Ned,moment,Stark,;-0.1875;6745;211
" Yet if what you say is true , they will only bide their time and make another attempt . ";Ned;Harwin,Varys,moment,Stark,;0.175;6746;211
" Indeed they will , " said Varys , " and sooner rather than later , I do fear . You are making them most anxious , Lord Eddard . But my little birds will be listening , and together we may be able to forestall them , you and I. " He rose and pulled up his cowl so his face was hidden once more . " Thank you for the wine . We will speak again . When you see me next at council , be certain to treat me with your accustomed contempt . You should not find it difficult . ";Varys;Harwin,Ned,moment,Stark,;0.110010822511;6747;211
He was at the door when Ned called , " Varys , " The eunuch turned back . " How did Jon Arryn die ? ";Ned;Jon,;0.0;6748;211
" I wondered when you would get around to that . ";Varys;Harwin,Ned,moment,Stark,;0.0;6749;211
" Tell me . ";Ned;Harwin,Varys,moment,Stark,;0.0;6750;211
" The tears of Lys , they call it . A rare and costly thing , clear and sweet as water , and it leaves no trace . I begged Lord Arryn to use a taster , in this very room I begged him , but he would not hear of it . Only one who was less than a man would even think of such a thing , he told me . ";Varys;Lord,;0.111904761905;6751;211
Ned had to know the rest . " Who gave him the poison ? ";Ned;Harwin,Varys,moment,Stark,;0.0;6752;211
" Some dear sweet friend who often shared meat and mead with him , no doubt . Oh , but which one ? There were many such . Lord Arryn was a kindly , trusting man . ";Varys;Lord,;0.283333333333;6753;211
The eunuch sighed . " There was one boy . All he was , he owed Jon Arryn , but when the widow fled to the Eyrie with her household , he stayed in King 's Landing and prospered . It always gladdens my heart to see the young rise in the world . ";Ned;Jon,;0.1;6754;211
The whip was in his voice again , every word a stroke . " He must have cut a gallant figure in the tourney , him in his bright new armor , with those crescent moons on his cloak . A pity he died so untimely , before you could talk to him ... ";Varys;Harwin,Ned,moment,Stark,;0.418181818182;6755;211
Ned felt half-poisoned himself . " The squire , " he said . " Ser Hugh . ";Ned;Harwin,Varys,moment,Stark,;0.0;6756;211
Ned 's head was pounding . " Why ? Why now ? Jon Arryn had been Hand for fourteen years . What was he doing that they had to kill him ? ";Ned;Jon,;0.0;6758;211
" Asking questions , " Varys said , slipping out the door .;Varys;Harwin,Ned,moment,Stark,;-0.1;6759;211
" None of us will go hungry tonight , " Bronn said .;Bronn;Tyrion,Chiggen,Jyck,;0.0;6766;212
" Some of us may , " Tyrion told him . " I am not fond of eating horse . Particularly my horse . ";Tyrion;Bronn,Chiggen,Jyck,;0.0;6768;212
" Meat is meat , " Bronn said with a shrug . " The Dothraki like horse more than beef or pork . ";Bronn;Meat,;0.5;6769;212
" Do you take me for a Dothraki ? ";Tyrion;Dothraki,;0.0;6770;212
Chiggen sliced a thin strip of bloody meat off the carcass and held it up for inspection . " Want a taste , dwarf ? ";Chiggen;Bronn,Tyrion,Jyck,;-0.6;6774;212
" My brother Jaime gave me that mare for my twenty-third name day , " Tyrion said in a flat voice .;Tyrion;Jaime,;-0.025;6775;212
" Thank him for us , then . If you ever see him again . ";Bronn;Tyrion,Chiggen,Jyck,;0.0;6776;212
Chiggen grinned , showing yellow teeth , and swallowed the raw meat in two bites . " Tastes well bred . ";Chiggen;Bronn,Tyrion,Jyck,;-0.115384615385;6777;212
" Better if you fry it up with onions , " Bronn put in .;Bronn;Tyrion,Chiggen,Jyck,;0.5;6778;212
He had hours more riding ahead of him , followed by a few mouthfuls of food and a short , cold sleep on hard ground , and then another night of the same , and another , and another , and the gods only knew how it would end . " Damn her , " he muttered as he struggled up the road to rejoin his captors , remembering , " damn her and all the Starks . ";Tyrion;Bronn,Chiggen,Jyck,;-0.0845238095238;6782;212
One moment he'd been ordering supper , and an eye blink later he was facing a room of armed men , with Jyck reaching for a sword and the fat innkeep shrieking , " No swords , not here , please , m'lords . ";Jyck;Bronn,Tyrion,Chiggen,;0.0;6784;212
Tyrion wrenched down Jyck 's arm hurriedly , before he got them both hacked to pieces . " Where are your courtesies , Jyck ? Our good hostess said no swords . Do as she asks . ";Tyrion;Bronn,Chiggen,Jyck,;0.247222222222;6785;212
He forced a smile that must have looked as queasy as it felt . " You 're making a sad mistake , Lady Stark . I had no part in any attack on your son . On my honor - ";Bronn;Tyrion,Chiggen,Jyck,;-0.175;6786;212
" Lannister honor , " was all she said .;Tyrion;Bronn,Chiggen,Jyck,;0.0;6787;212
She held up her hands for all the room to see . " His dagger left these scars . The blade he sent to open my son 's throat . ";Bronn;Tyrion,Chiggen,Jyck,;0.0;6788;212
Tyrion felt the anger all around him , thick and smoky , fed by the deep cuts in the Stark woman 's hands . " Kill him , " hissed some drunken slattern from the back , and other voices took up the call , faster than he would have believed .;Tyrion;Bronn,Chiggen,Jyck,;-0.220833333333;6789;212
Tyrion spoke up loudly , trying to keep the quaver from his voice . " If Lady Stark believes I have some crime to answer for , I will go with her and answer for it . ";Tyrion;Stark,;-0.2;6791;212
And indeed , the black brother stepped aside silently when the old knight by Catelyn Stark 's side said , " Take their weapons , " and the sellsword Bronn stepped forward to pull the sword from Jyck 's fingers and relieve them all of their daggers . " Good , " the old man said as the tension in the common room ebbed palpably , " excellent . ";Bronn;Catelyn,Tyrion,;0.169047619048;6800;213
Scarlet-tinged spittle flew from the fat innkeep 's mouth as she begged of Catelyn Stark , " Do n't kill him here ! ";Catelyn;Bronn,Tyrion,;-0.25;6802;213
" Do n't kill him anywhere , " Tyrion urged .;Tyrion;Bronn,Catelyn,;0.0;6803;213
" Take him somewheres else , no blood here , m'lady , I wants no high lordlin 's quarrels . ";Catelyn;Bronn,Tyrion,;0.18;6804;213
" We are taking him back to Winterfell , " she said , and Tyrion thought , Well , perhaps ...;Tyrion;Bronn,Catelyn,;0.0;6805;213
" Winterfell it is , then , " he said instead .;Frey;Rodrik,;0.0;6815;214
So many things could happen along the way . " My father will wonder what has become of me , " he added , catching the eye of the swordsman who'd offered to yield up his room . " He 'll pay a handsome reward to any man who brings him word of what happened here today . ";Frey;Rodrik,;0.533333333333;6817;214
Ser Rodrik glanced at his lady , his look worried , as well it might be . " His men come with him , " the old knight announced . " And we 'll thank the rest of you to stay quiet about what you 've seen here . ";Rodrik;Frey,;0.05;6819;214
Catelyn Stark wasted no time . " We must ride at once . We 'll want fresh mounts , and provisions for the road . You men , know that you have the eternal gratitude of House Stark . If any of you choose to help us guard our captives and get them safe to Winterfell , I promise you shall be well rewarded . ";Catelyn;;0.04;6831;215
The wretched singer had come along with them . " There is a great song to be made from this , and I 'm the one to make it , " he told Catelyn Stark when he announced his intention of riding with them to see how the " splendid adventure " turned out .;Catelyn;Stark,;0.477777777778;6844;216
When he saw the narrow stony road , the foothills rising high and wild all around them , and the jagged snowcapped peaks on the distant horizon , all the hope went out of him in a rush . " This is the high road , " he gasped , looking at Lady Stark with accusation . " The eastern road . You said we were riding for Winterfell ! ";Stark;Catelyn,;-0.0191666666667;6848;216
Catelyn Stark favored him with the faintest of smiles . " Often and loudly , " she agreed . " No doubt your friends will ride that way when they come after us . I wish them good speed . ";Catelyn;Stark,;0.416666666667;6849;216
" We must have some rest , my lady , " the hedge knight Ser Willis Wode was saying to Catelyn Stark as Tyrion approached .;Willis;Rodrik,Tyrion,Kurleket,Stark,Lord,Catelyn,Marillion,Mohor,Bronn,;-0.2;6872;217
" Ser Willis speaks truly , my lady , " Ser Rodrik said . " This is the third horse we have lost - ";Rodrik;Willis,;0.0;6874;217
" We will lose more than horses if we 're overtaken by the Lannisters , " she reminded them .;Catelyn;Willis,Rodrik,Tyrion,Kurleket,Stark,Lord,Marillion,Mohor,Bronn,;0.5;6875;217
" Small chance of that here , " Tyrion put in .;Tyrion;Willis,Rodrik,Kurleket,Stark,Lord,Catelyn,Marillion,Mohor,Bronn,;-0.25;6877;217
" The lady did not ask your views , dwarf , " snapped Kurleket , a great fat oaf with short-cropped hair and a pig 's face .;Kurleket;Willis,Rodrik,Tyrion,Stark,Lord,Catelyn,Marillion,Mohor,Bronn,;0.8;6878;217
" Let him speak , " Lady Stark commanded .;Stark;Willis,Rodrik,Tyrion,Kurleket,Lord,Catelyn,Marillion,Mohor,Bronn,;-0.2;6884;217
Tyrion Lannister seated himself on a rock . " By now our pursuit is likely racing across the Neck , chasing your lie up the kingsroad ... assuming there is a pursuit , which is by no means certain . Oh , no doubt the word has reached my father ... but my father does not love me overmuch , and I am not at all sure that he will bother to bestir himself . ";Tyrion;Willis,Rodrik,Kurleket,Stark,Lord,Catelyn,Marillion,Mohor,Bronn,;0.303571428571;6885;217
It was only half a lie ; Lord Tywin Lannister cared not a fig for his deformed son , but he tolerated no slights on the honor of his House . " This is a cruel land , Lady Stark . You 'll find no succor until you reach the Vale , and each mount you lose burdens the others all the more . Worse , you risk losing me . I am small , and not strong , and if I die , then what 's the point ? ";Lord;Vale,;-0.135416666667;6886;217
" It might be said that your death is the point , Lannister , " Catelyn Stark replied .;Catelyn;Willis,Rodrik,Tyrion,Kurleket,Stark,Lord,Marillion,Mohor,Bronn,;-0.2;6888;217
" I think not , " Tyrion said . " If you wanted me dead , you had only to say the word , and one of these staunch friends of yours would gladly have given me a red smile . ";Tyrion;Willis,Rodrik,Kurleket,Stark,Lord,Catelyn,Marillion,Mohor,Bronn,;0.025;6889;217
" The Starks do not murder men in their beds . ";Catelyn;Stark,;0.0;6891;217
" Nor do I , " he said . " I tell you again , I had no part in the attempt to kill your son . ";Tyrion;Willis,Rodrik,Kurleket,Stark,Lord,Catelyn,Marillion,Mohor,Bronn,;0.0;6892;217
" The assassin was armed with your dagger . ";Catelyn;Willis,Rodrik,Tyrion,Kurleket,Stark,Lord,Marillion,Mohor,Bronn,;0.0;6893;217
Tyrion felt the heat rise in him . " It was not my dagger , " he insisted . " How many times must I swear to that ? Lady Stark , whatever you may believe of me , I am not a stupid man . Only a fool would arm a common footpad with his own blade . ";Tyrion;Willis,Rodrik,Kurleket,Stark,Lord,Catelyn,Marillion,Mohor,Bronn,;-0.0333333333333;6894;217
Just for a moment , he thought he saw a flicker of doubt in her eyes , but what she said was , " Why would Petyr lie to me ? ";Catelyn;Petyr,;0.0;6895;217
" Why does a bear shit in the woods ? ";Tyrion;Willis,Rodrik,Kurleket,Stark,Lord,Catelyn,Marillion,Mohor,Bronn,;-0.2;6896;217
he demanded . " Because it is his nature . Lying comes as easily as breathing to a man like Littlefinger . You ought to know that , you of all people . ";Catelyn;Willis,Rodrik,Tyrion,Kurleket,Stark,Lord,Marillion,Mohor,Bronn,;0.0;6897;217
She took a step toward him , her face tight . " And what does that mean , Lannister ? ";Kurleket;Willis,Rodrik,Tyrion,Stark,Lord,Catelyn,Marillion,Mohor,Bronn,;-0.245535714286;6898;217
Tyrion cocked his head . " Why , every man at court has heard him tell how he took your maidenhead , my lady . ";Tyrion;Willis,Rodrik,Kurleket,Stark,Lord,Catelyn,Marillion,Mohor,Bronn,;0.0;6899;217
" That is a lie ! ";Catelyn;Willis,Rodrik,Tyrion,Kurleket,Stark,Lord,Marillion,Mohor,Bronn,;0.0;6900;217
" Oh , wicked little imp , " Marillion said , shocked .;Marillion;Willis,Rodrik,Tyrion,Kurleket,Stark,Lord,Catelyn,Mohor,Bronn,;-0.44375;6902;217
Kurleket drew his dirk , a vicious piece of black iron . " At your word , m'lady , I 'll toss his lying tongue at your feet . ";Kurleket;Willis,Rodrik,Tyrion,Stark,Lord,Catelyn,Marillion,Mohor,Bronn,;-0.583333333333;6903;217
Catelyn Stark stared at Tyrion with a coldness on her face such as he had never seen . " Petyr Baelish loved me once . He was only a boy . His passion was a tragedy for all of us , but it was real , and pure , and nothing to be made mock of . He wanted my hand . That is the truth of the matter . You are truly an evil man , Lannister . ";Catelyn;Petyr,;-0.0265306122449;6905;217
" And you are truly a fool , Lady Stark . Littlefinger has never loved anyone but Littlefinger , and I promise you that it is not your hand that he boasts of , it 's those ripe breasts of yours , and that sweet mouth , and the heat between your legs . ";Kurleket;Littlefinger,;0.283333333333;6906;217
Tyrion felt the cold kiss of steel beneath his chin . " Shall I bleed him , my lady ? ";Tyrion;Willis,Rodrik,Kurleket,Stark,Lord,Catelyn,Marillion,Mohor,Bronn,;-0.6;6908;217
" Kill me and the truth dies with me , " Tyrion gasped .;Tyrion;Willis,Rodrik,Kurleket,Stark,Lord,Catelyn,Marillion,Mohor,Bronn,;0.0;6909;217
" Let him talk , " Catelyn Stark commanded .;Catelyn;Willis,Rodrik,Tyrion,Kurleket,Stark,Lord,Marillion,Mohor,Bronn,;-0.2;6910;217
Tyrion took a deep breath . " How did Littlefinger tell you I came by this dagger of his ? Answer me that . ";Tyrion;Littlefinger,;0.0;6912;217
" You won it from him in a wager , during the tourney on Prince Joffrey 's name day . ";Catelyn;Willis,Rodrik,Tyrion,Kurleket,Stark,Lord,Marillion,Mohor,Bronn,;0.0;6913;217
" When my brother Jaime was unhorsed by the Knight of Flowers , that was his story , no ? ";Tyrion;Jaime,;0.0;6914;217
" It was , " she admitted .;Catelyn;Willis,Rodrik,Tyrion,Kurleket,Stark,Lord,Marillion,Mohor,Bronn,;0.0;6915;217
" Riders ! ";Tyrion;Willis,Rodrik,Kurleket,Stark,Lord,Catelyn,Marillion,Mohor,Bronn,;0.0;6917;217
Catelyn Stark was the first to react . " Ser Rodrik , Ser Willis , to horse , " she shouted . " Get the other mounts behind us . Mohor , guard the prisoners - ";Catelyn;Willis,Rodrik,Tyrion,Kurleket,Stark,Lord,Marillion,Mohor,Bronn,;-0.11875;6921;217
" Arm us ! ";Kurleket;Willis,Rodrik,Tyrion,Stark,Lord,Catelyn,Marillion,Mohor,Bronn,;0.0;6922;217
Tyrion sprang to his feet and seized her by the arm . " You will need every sword . ";Tyrion;Willis,Rodrik,Kurleket,Stark,Lord,Catelyn,Marillion,Mohor,Bronn,;0.0;6923;217
" I hear them ! ";Kurleket;Willis,Rodrik,Tyrion,Stark,Lord,Catelyn,Marillion,Mohor,Bronn,;0.0;6928;217
He landed breathless in front of Catelyn Stark , an ungainly-looking man with wild tufts of rust-colored hair sticking out from under a conical steel cap . " Twenty men , maybe twenty-five , " he said , breathless . " Milk Snakes or Moon Brothers , by my guess . They must have eyes out , m'lady ... hidden watchers ... they know we 're here . ";Catelyn;Willis,Rodrik,Tyrion,Kurleket,Stark,Lord,Marillion,Mohor,Bronn,;-0.0888888888889;6933;217
Mohor crouched behind a boulder , both hands on his iron-tipped spear , a dagger between his teeth . " You , singer , " Ser Willis Wode called out . " Help me with this breastplate . ";Mohor;Willis,Rodrik,Tyrion,Kurleket,Stark,Lord,Catelyn,Marillion,Bronn,;-0.4;6935;217
Tyrion kept his grip on Catelyn Stark . " You have no choice , " he told her . " Three of us , and a fourth man wasted guarding us ... four men can be the difference between life and death up here . ";Tyrion;Willis,Rodrik,Kurleket,Stark,Lord,Catelyn,Marillion,Mohor,Bronn,;-0.133333333333;6937;217
" Give me your word that you will put down your swords again after the fight is done . ";Catelyn;Willis,Rodrik,Tyrion,Kurleket,Stark,Lord,Marillion,Mohor,Bronn,;-0.155555555556;6938;217
" My word ? ";Kurleket;Willis,Rodrik,Tyrion,Stark,Lord,Catelyn,Marillion,Mohor,Bronn,;0.0;6939;217
Tyrion grinned crookedly . " Oh , that you have , my lady ... on my honor as a Lannister . ";Tyrion;Willis,Rodrik,Kurleket,Stark,Lord,Catelyn,Marillion,Mohor,Bronn,;0.0;6941;217
For a moment he thought she would spit at him , but instead she snapped , " Arm them , " and as quick as that she was pulling away .;Catelyn;Willis,Rodrik,Tyrion,Kurleket,Stark,Lord,Marillion,Mohor,Bronn,;0.333333333333;6942;217
" I have never fought with an axe . ";Tyrion;Willis,Rodrik,Kurleket,Stark,Lord,Catelyn,Marillion,Mohor,Bronn,;0.0;6947;217
" Pretend you 're splitting logs , " Bronn said , drawing his longsword from the scabbard across his back .;Bronn;Willis,Rodrik,Tyrion,Kurleket,Stark,Lord,Catelyn,Marillion,Mohor,;0.0;6950;217
" Logs do n't bleed , " Tyrion said to no one in particular .;Tyrion;Willis,Rodrik,Kurleket,Stark,Lord,Catelyn,Marillion,Mohor,Bronn,;0.166666666667;6953;217
He looked around for a rock and ran over to where Marillion was hiding . " Move over . ";Marillion;Willis,Rodrik,Tyrion,Kurleket,Stark,Lord,Catelyn,Mohor,Bronn,;0.0;6955;217
" Go away ! ";Tyrion;Willis,Rodrik,Kurleket,Stark,Lord,Catelyn,Marillion,Mohor,Bronn,;0.0;6956;217
the boy screamed back at him . " I 'm a singer , I want no part of this fight ! ";Catelyn;Willis,Rodrik,Tyrion,Kurleket,Stark,Lord,Marillion,Mohor,Bronn,;0.0;6957;217
" What , lost your taste for adventure ? ";Tyrion;Willis,Rodrik,Kurleket,Stark,Lord,Catelyn,Marillion,Mohor,Bronn,;0.0;6958;217
Ser Rodrik shouted " Winterfell ! ";Rodrik;Willis,Tyrion,Kurleket,Stark,Lord,Catelyn,Marillion,Mohor,Bronn,;0.0;6964;217
Ser Willis Wode followed , swinging a spiked morningstar around his head . " Harrenhal ! Harrenhal ! ";Willis;Rodrik,Tyrion,Kurleket,Stark,Lord,Catelyn,Marillion,Mohor,Bronn,;0.0;6966;217
Tyrion felt a sudden urge to leap up , brandish his axe , and boom out , " Casterly Rock ! ";Tyrion;Willis,Rodrik,Kurleket,Stark,Lord,Catelyn,Marillion,Mohor,Bronn,;0.0;6968;217
As he struggled to yank the blade loose , he heard Marillion moaning under the bodies . " Someone help me , " the singer gasped . " Gods have mercy , I 'm bleeding . ";Marillion;Gods,;-0.0769230769231;6985;218
" I believe that 's horse blood , " Tyrion said .;Tyrion;Marillion,;0.0;6986;218
Tyrion put his heel on the grasping fingers and felt a satisfying crunch . " Close your eyes and pretend you 're dead , " he advised the singer before he hefted the axe and turned away .;Tyrion;Marillion,;0.15;6988;218
" Your first battle ? ";Tyrion;Bronn,;0.25;7015;219
Tyrion nodded . " My father will be so proud , " he said .;Tyrion;Bronn,;0.8;7018;219
" You need a woman now , " Bronn said with a glint in his black eyes .;Bronn;Tyrion,;-0.166666666667;7021;219
He shoved the boots into his saddlebag . " Nothing like a woman after a man 's been blooded , take my word . ";Tyrion;Bronn,;0.0;7022;219
Tyrion glanced over to where Lady Stark was dressing Ser Rodrik 's wounds . " I 'm willing if she is , " he said .;Tyrion;Bronn,;0.025;7024;219
" Lady Stark , I urge you to press on , with all haste , " Ser Willis Wode said , his eyes scanning the ridgetops warily through the slit in his helm . " We drove them off for the moment , but they will not have gone far . ";Willis;Bronn,Rodrik,Tyrion,Lharys,Catelyn,;-0.05;7035;220
" We must bury our dead , Ser Willis , " she said . " These were brave men . I will not leave them to the crows and shadowcats . ";Tyrion;Willis,Bronn,Rodrik,Lharys,Catelyn,;0.3;7036;220
" This soil is too stony for digging , " Ser Willis said .;Willis;Bronn,Rodrik,Tyrion,Lharys,Catelyn,;0.0;7037;220
" Then we shall gather stones for cairns . ";Tyrion;Willis,Bronn,Rodrik,Lharys,Catelyn,;0.0;7038;220
" Gather all the stones you want , " Bronn told her , " but do it without me or Chiggen . I 've better things to do than pile rocks on dead men ... breathing , for one . ";Bronn;Chiggen,;0.15;7039;220
He looked over the rest of the survivors . " Any of you who hope to be alive come nightfall , ride with us . ";Willis;Bronn,Rodrik,Tyrion,Lharys,Catelyn,;0.1;7040;220
" My lady , I fear he speaks the truth , " Ser Rodrik said wearily .;Rodrik;Willis,Bronn,Tyrion,Lharys,Catelyn,;0.0;7041;220
The old knight had been wounded in the fight , a deep gash in his left arm and a spear thrust that grazed his neck , and he sounded his age . " If we linger here , they will be on us again for a certainty , and we may not live through a second attack . ";Willis;Bronn,Rodrik,Tyrion,Lharys,Catelyn,;0.0472727272727;7042;220
Tyrion could see the anger in Catelyn 's face , but she had no choice . " May the gods forgive us , then . We will ride at once . ";Tyrion;Willis,Bronn,Rodrik,Lharys,Catelyn,;-0.7;7043;220
He was about to mount when Lharys stepped up and said , " I 'll take that dirk now , dwarf . ";Lharys;Willis,Bronn,Rodrik,Tyrion,Catelyn,;0.0;7046;220
" Let him keep it . ";Willis;Bronn,Rodrik,Tyrion,Lharys,Catelyn,;0.0;7047;220
Catelyn Stark looked down from her horse . " And see that he has his axe back as well . We may have need of it if we are attacked again . ";Catelyn;Willis,Bronn,Rodrik,Tyrion,Lharys,;-0.118518518519;7048;220
" You have my thanks , lady , " Tyrion said , mounting up .;Tyrion;Willis,Bronn,Rodrik,Lharys,Catelyn,;0.2;7049;220
" Save them , " she said curtly . " I trust you no more than I did before . ";Willis;Bronn,Rodrik,Tyrion,Lharys,Catelyn,;0.5;7050;220
Tyrion trotted up beside him . " Craven , " he said , " rhymes nicely with raven . ";Tyrion;;0.0;7062;221
" As I was saying before we were so rudely interrupted , " Tyrion began , " there is a serious flaw in Littlefinger 's fable . Whatever you may believe of me , Lady Stark , I promise you this-I never bet against my family . ";Tyrion;;-0.266666666667;7065;221
When she'd run to him with her hands bleeding , he had said , " So slow ? Be quicker , girl . Your enemies will give you more than scratches . ";Syrio;;0.1;7076;222
all but this one , this one-eared black devil of a tomcat . " That 's the real king of this castle right there , " one of the gold cloaks had told her . " Older than sin and twice as mean . One time , the king was feasting the queen 's father , and that black bastard hopped up on the table and snatched a roast quail right out of Lord Tywin 's fingers . Robert laughed so hard he like to burst . You stay away from that one , child . ";Syrio;Robert,;0.0667328042328;7081;222

To her brother she said , " He 's a ragged boy , is n't he ? Look at him . ";Myrcella;Tom,;0.0;7103;224
" A ragged dirty smelly boy , " Tommen agreed .;Tom;Myrcella,;-0.6;7105;224
The old fat septa moved forward . " Boy , how did you come here ? You have no business in this part of the castle . ";Mordane;Arya,;0.1;7114;225
" You ca n't keep this sort out , " one of the red cloaks said . " Like trying to keep out rats . ";Mordane;Arya,;0.0;7115;225
" Who do you belong to , boy ? ";Mordane;Arya,;0.0;7116;225
the septa demanded . " Answer me . What 's wrong with you , are you mute ? ";Arya;Mordane,;-0.5;7117;225
" Godwyn , bring him here , " the septa said .;Mordane;Arya,;0.0;7120;225
Arya slid between legs as thick and white as marble columns , bounded to her feet , bowled into Prince Tommen and hopped over him when he sat down hard and said " Oof , " spun away from the second guard , and then she was past them all , running full out .;Arya;;-0.0924603174603;7132;226
" It 's dead , " she said aloud . " It 's just a skull , it ca n't hurt me . ";Arya;;-0.2;7180;227
" ... found one bastard , " one said . " The rest will come soon . A day , two days , a fortnight ... ";Arya;direction,;0.0;7215;228
" And when he learns the truth , what will he do ? ";Arya;direction,;0.0;7216;228
" The gods alone know , " the first voice said .;Arya;direction,;0.25;7218;228
Arya could see a wisp of grey smoke drifting up off the torch , writhing like a snake as it rose . " The fools tried to kill his son , and what 's worse , they made a mummer 's farce of it . He 's not a man to put that aside . I warn you , the wolf and lion will soon be at each other 's throats , whether we will it or no . ";Arya;direction,;0.00625;7219;228
" Too soon , too soon , " the voice with the accent complained . " What good is war now ? We are not ready . Delay . ";Arya;direction,;0.183333333333;7220;228
" As well bid me stop time . Do you take me for a wizard ? ";Arya;direction,;0.0;7221;228

" Before is not now , and this Hand is not the other , " the scarred man said as they stepped out into the hall .;Arya;direction,;-0.125;7239;228
" Perhaps so , " the forked beard replied , pausing to catch his breath after the long climb . " Nonetheless , we must have time . The princess is with child . The khal will not bestir himself until his son is born . You know how they are , these savages . ";Arya;direction,;-0.05;7242;228
" If he does not bestir himself soon , it may be too late , " the stout man in the steel cap said . " This is no longer a game for two players , if ever it was . Stannis Baratheon and Lysa Arryn have fled beyond my reach , and the whispers say they are gathering swords around them . The Knight of Flowers writes Highgarden , urging his lord father to send his sister to court . The girl is a maid of fourteen , sweet and beautiful and tractable , and Lord Renly and Ser Loras intend that Robert should bed her , wed her , and make a new queen . Littlefinger ... the gods only know what game Littlefinger is playing . Yet Lord Stark 's the one who troubles my sleep . He has the bastard , he has the book , and soon enough he 'll have the truth . And now his wife has abducted Tyrion Lannister , thanks to Littlefinger 's meddling . Lord Tywin will take that for an outrage , and Jaime has a queer affection for the Imp. If the Lannisters move north , that will bring the Tullys in as well . Delay , you say . Make haste , I reply .

" What I can do , I will , " the one with the torch said softly . " I must have gold , and another fifty birds . ";direction;Arya,;0.0;7250;228
" So many ? ";Arya;direction,;0.5;7253;228
The voices were fainter as the light dwindled ahead of her . " The ones you need are hard to find ... so young , to know their letters ... perhaps older ... not die so easy ... ";Arya;direction,;0.161666666667;7254;228

The gold cloaks who had the watch sneered when she told them to let her in . " Off with you , " one said . " The kitchen scraps are gone , and we 'll have no begging after dark . ";King;Arya,Father,Stark,Ned,Tom,Desmond,Yoren,;-0.15;7274;229

" I want to see my father . ";Arya;King,Father,Stark,Ned,Tom,Desmond,Yoren,;0.0;7277;229
The guards exchanged a glance . " I want to fuck the queen myself , for all the good it does me , " the younger one said .;Yoren;King,Arya,Father,Stark,Ned,Tom,Desmond,;0.0833333333333;7278;229
The older scowled . " Who 's this father of yours , boy , the city ratcatcher ? ";Desmond;King,Arya,Father,Stark,Ned,Tom,Yoren,;0.166666666667;7279;229
" The Hand of the King , " Arya told him .;Arya;King,Father,Stark,Ned,Tom,Desmond,Yoren,;0.0;7280;229
She danced back out of the way , untouched . " I 'm not a boy , " she spat at them . " I 'm Arya Stark of Winterfell , and if you lay a hand on me my lord father will have both your heads on spikes . If you do n't believe me , fetch Jory Cassel or Vayon Poole from the Tower of the Hand . ";Yoren;Arya,Jory,;-0.1;7283;229
She put her hands on her hips . " Now are you going to open the gate , or do you need a clout on the ear to help your hearing ? ";Father;King,Arya,Stark,Ned,Tom,Desmond,Yoren,;0.0;7284;229
" You realize I had half my guard out searching for you ? ";Arya;King,Father,Stark,Ned,Tom,Desmond,Yoren,;-0.166666666667;7288;229
Eddard Stark said when they were alone . " Septa Mordane is beside herself with fear . She 's in the sept praying for your safe return . Arya , you know you are never to go beyond the castle gates without my leave . ";Stark;Mordane,;0.15;7289;229
" I did n't go out the gates , " she blurted . " Well , I did n't mean to . I was down in the dungeons , only they turned into this tunnel . It was all dark , and I did n't have a torch or a candle to see by , so I had to follow . I could n't go back the way I came on account of the monsters . Father , they were talking about killing you ! Not the monsters , the two men . They did n't see me , I was being still as stone and quiet as a shadow , but I heard them . They said you had a book and a bastard and if one Hand could die , why not a second ? Is that the book ? Jon 's the bastard , I bet . ";Arya;Jon,;-0.0936507936508;7290;229
" Jon ? Arya , what are you talking about ? Who said this ? ";Yoren;King,Arya,Father,Stark,Ned,Tom,Desmond,;0.0;7291;229
" They did , " she told him . " There was a fat one with rings and a forked yellow beard , and another in mail and a steel cap , and the fat one said they had to delay but the other one told him he could n't keep juggling and the wolf and the lion were going to eat each other and it was a mummer 's farce . ";Arya;King,Father,Stark,Ned,Tom,Desmond,Yoren,;-0.0833333333333;7292;229
She had n't quite understood everything she'd heard , and now it was all mixed up in her head . " The fat one said the princess was with child . The one in the steel cap , he had the torch , he said that they had to hurry . I think he was a wizard . ";Yoren;King,Arya,Father,Stark,Ned,Tom,Desmond,;0.0;7294;229
" A wizard , " said Ned , unsmiling . " Did he have a long white beard and tall pointed hat speckled with stars ? ";Ned;King,Arya,Father,Stark,Tom,Desmond,Yoren,;-0.025;7295;229
" No ! It was n't like Old Nan 's stories . He did n't look like a wizard , but the fat one said he was . ";Arya;King,Father,Stark,Ned,Tom,Desmond,Yoren,;0.1;7296;229
" I warn you , Arya , if you 're spinning this thread of air - ";Yoren;King,Arya,Father,Stark,Ned,Tom,Desmond,;0.0;7297;229
" No , I told you , it was in the dungeons , by the place with the secret wall . I was chasing cats , and well ... ";Arya;King,Father,Stark,Ned,Tom,Desmond,Yoren,;-0.4;7298;229
If she admitted knocking over Prince Tommen , he would be really angry with her . " ... well , I went in this window . That 's where I found the monsters . ";Tom;King,Arya,Father,Stark,Ned,Desmond,Yoren,;-1.0;7300;229
" Monsters and wizards , " her father said . " It would seem you 've had quite an adventure . These men you heard , you say they spoke of juggling and mummery ? ";Yoren;King,Arya,Father,Stark,Ned,Tom,Desmond,;0.0;7301;229
" Yes , " Arya admitted , " only - ";Arya;King,Father,Stark,Ned,Tom,Desmond,Yoren,;0.0;7302;229
" Arya , they were mummers , " her father told her . " There must be a dozen troupes in King 's Landing right now , come to make some coin off the tourney crowds . I 'm not certain what these two were doing in the castle , but perhaps the king has asked for a show . ";Yoren;King,Arya,Father,Stark,Ned,Tom,Desmond,;0.25;7303;229
" No . ";Arya;King,Father,Stark,Ned,Tom,Desmond,Yoren,;0.0;7304;229
She shook her head stubbornly . " They were n't - ";Yoren;King,Arya,Father,Stark,Ned,Tom,Desmond,;0.0;7305;229
" You should n't be following people about and spying on them in any case . Nor do I cherish the notion of my daughter climbing in strange windows after stray cats . Look at you , sweetling . Your arms are covered with scratches . This has gone on long enough . Tell Syrio Forel that I want a word with him - ";Arya;Syrio,;-0.025;7306;229
He was interrupted by a short , sudden knock . " Lord Eddard , pardons , " Desmond called out , opening the door a crack , " but there 's a black brother here begging audience . He says the matter is urgent . I thought you would want to know . ";Desmond;King,Arya,Father,Stark,Ned,Tom,Yoren,;-0.0555555555556;7307;229
" My door is always open to the Night 's Watch , " Father said .;Father;King,Arya,Stark,Ned,Tom,Desmond,Yoren,;0.0;7308;229
" Yoren , as it please m'lord . My pardons for the hour . ";Yoren;King,Arya,Father,Stark,Ned,Tom,Desmond,;0.0;7311;229

" I 'm a girl , " Arya said , exasperated .;Arya;King,Father,Stark,Ned,Tom,Desmond,Yoren,;0.0;7313;229
If the old man was down from the Wall , he must have come by way of Winterfell . " Do you know my brothers ? ";King;Arya,Father,Stark,Ned,Tom,Desmond,Yoren,;-0.0277777777778;7314;229
she asked excitedly . " Robb and Bran are at Winterfell , and Jon 's on the Wall . Jon Snow , he 's in the Night 's Watch too , you must know him , he has a direwolf , a white one with red eyes . Is Jon a ranger yet ? I 'm Arya Stark . ";Yoren;Bran,Arya,;-0.0666666666667;7315;229
The old man in his smelly black clothes was looking at her oddly , but Arya could not seem to stop talking . " When you ride back to the Wall , would you bring Jon a letter if I wrote one ? ";Arya;King,Father,Stark,Ned,Tom,Desmond,Yoren,;-0.0222222222222;7316;229
" My daughter often forgets her courtesies , " Eddard Stark said with a faint smile that softened his words . " I beg your forgiveness , Yoren . Did my brother Benjen send you ? ";Stark;brother,;-0.133333333333;7319;229
" No one sent me , m'lord , saving old Mormont . I 'm here to find men for the Wall , and when Robert next holds court , I 'll bend the knee and cry our need , see if the king and his Hand have some scum in the dungeons they'd be well rid of . You might say as Benjen Stark is why we 're talking , though . His blood ran black . Made him my brother as much as yours . It 's for his sake I 'm come . Rode hard , I did , near killed my horse the way I drove her , but I left the others well behind . ";Arya;Stark,Mormont,;-0.0842592592593;7320;229
" The others ? ";Desmond;King,Arya,Father,Stark,Ned,Tom,Yoren,;0.0;7321;229
Yoren spat . " Sellswords and freeriders and like trash . That inn was full o ' them , and I saw them take the scent . The scent of blood or the scent of gold , they smell the same in the end . Not all o ' them made for King 's Landing , either . Some went galloping for Casterly Rock , and the Rock lies closer . Lord Tywin will have gotten the word by now , you can count on it .

Father frowned . " What word is this ? ";Father;King,Arya,Stark,Ned,Tom,Desmond,Yoren,;0.0;7323;229

" As you say . Desmond , see my daughter to her chambers . ";Arya;King,Father,Stark,Ned,Tom,Desmond,Yoren,;0.0;7325;229
He kissed her on the brow . " We 'll finish our talk on the morrow . ";Yoren;King,Arya,Father,Stark,Ned,Tom,Desmond,;0.0;7326;229
Arya stood rooted to the spot . " Nothing bad 's happened to Jon , has it ? ";Arya;King,Father,Stark,Ned,Tom,Desmond,Yoren,;-0.616666666667;7327;229
she asked Yoren . " Or Uncle Benjen ? ";Yoren;King,Arya,Father,Stark,Ned,Tom,Desmond,;0.0;7328;229
" Well , as to Stark , I ca n't say . The Snow boy was well enough when I left the Wall . It 's not them as concerns me . ";Arya;King,;-0.0666666666667;7329;229
Desmond took her hand . " Come along , milady . You heard your lord father . ";Desmond;King,Arya,Father,Stark,Ned,Tom,Yoren,;0.0;7330;229
With Tom , she might have been able to linger at the door on some excuse and hear what Yoren was saying , but Desmond was too single-minded to trick . " How many guards does my father have ? ";Yoren;King,Arya,Father,Stark,Ned,Tom,Desmond,;0.5;7332;229
" Here at King 's Landing ? Fifty . ";Arya;King,Father,Stark,Ned,Tom,Desmond,Yoren,;0.0;7334;229
" You would n't let anyone kill him , would you ? ";Yoren;King,Arya,Father,Stark,Ned,Tom,Desmond,;0.0;7335;229
Desmond laughed . " No fear on that count , little lady . Lord Eddard 's guarded night and day . He 'll come to no harm . ";Desmond;King,Arya,Father,Stark,Ned,Tom,Yoren,;0.304166666667;7337;229
" The Lannisters have more than fifty men , " Arya pointed out .;Arya;Lannister,;0.5;7338;229

" What if a wizard was sent to kill him ? ";Arya;King,Father,Stark,Ned,Tom,Desmond,Yoren,;0.0;7340;229

" The whore is pregnant ! ";Varys;Ned,Stark,Robert,Lord,Serrett,Maester,Littlefinger,;0.416666666667;7346;230
The king 's fist slammed down on the council table loud as a thunderclap . " I warned you this would happen , Ned . Back in the barrowlands , I warned you , but you did not care to hear it . Well , you 'll hear it now . I want them dead , mother and child both , and that fool Viserys as well . Is that plain enough for you ? I want them dead .

" Then let it be on my head , so long as it is done . I am not so blind that I cannot see the shadow of the axe when it is hanging over my own neck . ";Varys;Ned,Stark,Robert,Lord,Serrett,Maester,Littlefinger,;0.0166666666667;7351;230

" If ? ";Robert;Ned,Stark,Varys,Lord,Serrett,Maester,Littlefinger,;0.0;7353;230
Varys asked softly , wringing powdered hands together . " My lord , you wrong me . Would I bring lies to king and council ? ";Varys;Ned,Stark,Robert,Lord,Serrett,Maester,Littlefinger,;-0.5;7354;230
Ned looked at the eunuch coldly . " You would bring us the whisperings of a traitor half a world away , my lord . Perhaps Mormont is wrong . Perhaps he is lying . ";Ned;Mormont,;-0.333333333333;7355;230
" Ser Jorah would not dare deceive me , " Varys said with a sly smile . " Rely on it , my lord . The princess is with child . ";Varys;Jorah,;0.3;7356;230
" So you say . If you are wrong , we need not fear . If the girl miscarries , we need not fear . If she births a daughter in place of a son , we need not fear . If the babe dies in infancy , we need not fear . ";Ned;Stark,Varys,Robert,Lord,Serrett,Maester,Littlefinger,;-0.5;7357;230
" But if it is a boy ? ";Varys;Ned,Stark,Robert,Lord,Serrett,Maester,Littlefinger,;0.0;7358;230
Robert insisted . " If he lives ? ";Robert;Ned,Stark,Varys,Lord,Serrett,Maester,Littlefinger,;0.0;7359;230
" The narrow sea would still lie between us . I shall fear the Dothraki the day they teach their horses to run on water . ";Varys;Dothraki,;-0.2;7360;230
The king took a swallow of wine and glowered at Ned across the council table . " So you would counsel me to do nothing until the dragonspawn has landed his army on my shores , is that it ? ";Ned;Stark,Varys,Robert,Lord,Serrett,Maester,Littlefinger,;0.0;7361;230
" This ' dragonspawn ' is in his mother 's belly , " Ned said . " Even Aegon did no conquering until after he was weaned . ";Ned;Aegon,;0.0;7362;230
" Gods ! You are stubborn as an aurochs , Stark . ";Varys;Ned,Stark,Robert,Lord,Serrett,Maester,Littlefinger,;-0.2;7363;230

Varys gave the king an unctuous smile and laid a soft hand on Ned 's sleeve . " I understand your qualms , Lord Eddard , truly I do . It gave me no joy to bring this grievous news to council . It is a terrible thing we contemplate , a vile thing . Yet we who presume to rule must do vile things for the good of the realm , howevermuch it pains us .

Lord Renly shrugged . " The matter seems simple enough to me . We ought to have had Viserys and his sister killed years ago , but His Grace my brother made the mistake of listening to Jon Arryn . ";Lord;Ned,Stark,Varys,Robert,Serrett,Maester,Littlefinger,;0.0;7366;230
" Mercy is never a mistake , Lord Renly , " Ned replied . " On the Trident , Ser Barristan here cut down a dozen good men , Robert 's friends and mine . When they brought him to us , grievously wounded and near death , Roose Bolton urged us to cut his throat , but your brother said , ' I will not kill a man for loyalty , nor for fighting well , ' and sent his own maester to tend Ser Barristan 's wounds .

He gave the king a long cool look . " Would that man were here today . ";Varys;Ned,Stark,Robert,Lord,Serrett,Maester,Littlefinger,;0.15;7368;230
Robert had shame enough to blush . " It was not the same , " he complained . " Ser Barristan was a knight of the Kingsguard . ";Robert;Serrett,;-0.1;7369;230
" Whereas Daenerys is a fourteen-year-old girl . ";Varys;Daenerys,;0.0;7370;230
Ned knew he was pushing this well past the point of wisdom , yet he could not keep silent . " Robert , I ask you , what did we rise against Aerys Targaryen for , if not to put an end to the murder of children ? ";Ned;Stark,Varys,Robert,Lord,Serrett,Maester,Littlefinger,;-0.125;7371;230

Robert purpled . " No more , Ned , " he warned , pointing . " Not another word . Have you forgotten who is king here ? ";Robert;Ned,Stark,Varys,Lord,Serrett,Maester,Littlefinger,;0.5;7376;230
" No , Your Grace , " Ned replied . " Have you ? ";Ned;Stark,Varys,Robert,Lord,Serrett,Maester,Littlefinger,;0.0;7377;230
" Enough ! ";Varys;Ned,Stark,Robert,Lord,Serrett,Maester,Littlefinger,;0.0;7378;230

" We have no choice , " murmured Varys . " Sadly , sadly ... ";Varys;Ned,Stark,Robert,Lord,Serrett,Maester,Littlefinger,;0.0;7381;230
Ser Barristan Selmy raised his pale blue eyes from the table and said , " Your Grace , there is honor in facing an enemy on the battlefield , but none in killing him in his mother 's womb .

Grand Maester Pycelle cleared his throat , a process that seemed to take some minutes . " My order serves the realm , not the ruler . Once I counseled King Aerys as loyally as I counsel King Robert now , so I bear this girl child of his no ill will . Yet I ask you this-should war come again , how many soldiers will die ? How many towns will burn ? How many children will be ripped from their mothers to perish on the end of a spear ? ";Maester;King,;0.3;7383;230
He stroked his luxuriant white beard , infinitely sad , infinitely weary . " Is it not wiser , even kinder , that Daenerys Targaryen should die now so that tens of thousands might live ? ";Ned;Targaryen,;-0.121212121212;7384;230
" Kinder , " Varys said . " Oh , well and truly spoken , Grand Maester . It is so true . Should the gods in their caprice grant Daenerys Targaryen a son , the realm must bleed . ";Varys;Ned,Stark,Robert,Lord,Serrett,Maester,Littlefinger,;0.425;7385;230
As Ned looked to him , Lord Petyr stifled a yawn . " When you find yourself in bed with an ugly woman , the best thing to do is close your eyes and get on with it , " he declared . " Waiting wo n't make the maid any prettier . Kiss her and be done with it . ";Ned;Stark,Varys,Robert,Lord,Serrett,Maester,Littlefinger,;0.15;7387;230
" Kiss her ? ";Varys;Ned,Stark,Robert,Lord,Serrett,Maester,Littlefinger,;0.0;7388;230
" A steel kiss , " said Littlefinger .;Littlefinger;Ned,Stark,Varys,Robert,Lord,Serrett,Maester,;0.0;7390;230
Robert turned to face his Hand . " Well , there it is , Ned . You and Selmy stand alone on this matter . The only question that remains is , who can we find to kill her ? ";Robert;Selmy,;0.0;7391;230
" Mormont craves a royal pardon , " Lord Renly reminded them .;Lord;Mormont,;0.0;7392;230
" Desperately , " Varys said , " yet he craves life even more . By now , the princess nears Vaes Dothrak , where it is death to draw a blade . If I told you what the Dothraki would do to the poor man who used one on a khaleesi , none of you would sleep tonight . ";Varys;Dothraki,;0.05;7393;230
He stroked a powdered cheek . " Now , poison ... the tears of Lys , let us say . Khal Drogo need never know it was not a natural death . ";Ned;Stark,Varys,Robert,Lord,Serrett,Maester,Littlefinger,;0.1;7394;230
" Poison is a coward 's weapon , " the king complained .;Varys;Ned,Stark,Robert,Lord,Serrett,Maester,Littlefinger,;-0.3;7397;230
Ned had heard enough . " You send hired knives to kill a fourteen-year-old girl and still quibble about honor ? ";Ned;Stark,Varys,Robert,Lord,Serrett,Maester,Littlefinger,;0.0;7398;230
He pushed back his chair and stood . " Do it yourself , Robert . The man who passes the sentence should swing the sword . Look her in the eyes before you kill her . See her tears , hear her last words . You owe her that much at least . ";Varys;Ned,Stark,Robert,Lord,Serrett,Maester,Littlefinger,;-0.05;7399;230
" Gods , " the king swore , the word exploding out of him as if he could barely contain his fury . " You mean it , damn you . ";Ned;Stark,Varys,Robert,Lord,Serrett,Maester,Littlefinger,;-0.3125;7400;230
He reached for the flagon of wine at his elbow , found it empty , and flung it away to shatter against the wall . " I am out of wine and out of patience . Enough of this . Just have it done . ";Varys;Ned,Stark,Robert,Lord,Serrett,Maester,Littlefinger,;-0.05;7401;230
" I will not be part of murder , Robert . Do as you will , but do not ask me to fix my seal to it . ";Robert;Ned,Stark,Varys,Lord,Serrett,Maester,Littlefinger,;0.0;7402;230
He pointed an angry finger at Ned . " You are the King 's Hand , Lord Stark . You will do as I command you , or I 'll find me a Hand who will . ";Ned;King,;-0.35;7407;230
" I wish him every success . ";Varys;Ned,Stark,Robert,Lord,Serrett,Maester,Littlefinger,;0.3;7408;230
He laid it on the table in front of the king , saddened by the memory of the man who had pinned it on him , the friend he had loved . " I thought you a better man than this , Robert . I thought we had made a nobler king . ";Ned;Stark,Varys,Robert,Lord,Serrett,Maester,Littlefinger,;0.6;7410;230
Robert 's face was purple . " Out , " he croaked , choking on his rage . " Out , damn you , I 'm done with you . What are you waiting for ? Go , run back to Winterfell . And make certain I never look on your face again , or I swear , I 'll have your head on a spike ! ";Robert;Ned,Stark,Varys,Lord,Serrett,Maester,Littlefinger,;0.133928571429;7411;230
As he strode from the council chambers , the discussion resumed with scarcely a pause . " On Braavos there is a society called the Faceless Men , " Grand Maester Pycelle offered .;Maester;Ned,Stark,Varys,Robert,Lord,Serrett,Littlefinger,;0.5;7414;230
" Do you have any idea how costly they are ? ";Ned;Stark,Varys,Robert,Lord,Serrett,Maester,Littlefinger,;0.0;7415;230
Littlefinger complained . " You could hire an army of common sellswords for half the price , and that 's for a merchant . I do n't dare think what they might ask for a princess . ";Littlefinger;Ned,Stark,Varys,Robert,Lord,Serrett,Maester,;-0.255555555556;7416;230
The steward came at once . " You sent for me , my lord Hand ? ";Ned;;0.0;7425;231
" Hand no longer , " Ned told him . " The king and I have quarreled . We shall be returning to Winterfell . ";Ned;;0.0;7426;231
" I shall begin making arrangements at once , my lord . We will need a fortnight to ready everything for the journey . ";Ned;;0.2;7427;231
" We may not have a fortnight . We may not have a day . The king mentioned something about seeing my head on a spike . ";Ned;;0.0;7428;231
" It might be safest if I went on ahead , " he told Poole . " I will take my daughters and a few guardsmen . The rest of you can follow when you are ready . Inform Jory , but tell no one else , and do nothing until the girls and I have gone . The castle is full of eyes and ears , and I would rather my plans were not known . ";Jeyne;;0.116666666667;7438;232
" As you command , my lord . ";Jeyne;;0.0;7439;232
He summoned Vayon Poole again and sent him to the docks to make inquiries , quietly but quickly . " Find me a fast ship with a skilled captain , " he told the steward . " I care nothing for the size of its cabins or the quality of its appointments , so long as it is swift and safe . I wish to leave at once . ";Jeyne;Ned,Littlefinger,;0.2875;7476;233
Poole had no sooner taken his leave than Tomard announced a visitor . " Lord Baelish to see you , m'lord . ";Jeyne;Ned,Littlefinger,;0.0;7477;233
He was not free yet ; until he was , he must play their games . " Show him in , Tom . ";Littlefinger;Jeyne,Ned,;0.4;7479;233
Ned greeted him coldly . " Might I ask the reason for this visit , Lord Baelish ? ";Ned;Jeyne,Littlefinger,;0.0;7482;233
" I wo n't detain you long , I 'm on my way to dine with Lady Tanda . Lamprey pie and roast suckling pig . She has some thought to wed me to her younger daughter , so her table is always astonishing . If truth be told , I'd sooner marry the pig , but do n't tell her . I do love lamprey pie . ";Littlefinger;I'd,;0.2375;7483;233
" Do n't let me keep you from your eels , my lord , " Ned said with icy disdain . " At the moment , I cannot think of anyone whose company I desire less than yours . ";Ned;Jeyne,Littlefinger,;-0.133333333333;7484;233
" Oh , I 'm certain if you put your mind to it , you could come up with a few names . Varys , say . Cersei . Or Robert . His Grace is most wroth with you . He went on about you at some length after you took your leave of us this morning . The words insolence and ingratitude came into it frequently , I seem to recall . ";Jeyne;Grace,;0.171428571429;7485;233
Nor did he offer his guest a seat , but Littlefinger took one anyway . " After you stormed out , it was left to me to convince them not to hire the Faceless Men , " he continued blithely . " Instead Varys will quietly let it be known that we 'll make a lord of whoever does in the Targaryen girl . ";Littlefinger;Varys,;0.0;7487;233
Ned was disgusted . " So now we grant titles to assassins . ";Ned;Jeyne,Littlefinger,;-1.0;7488;233
Littlefinger shrugged . " Titles are cheap . The Faceless Men are expensive . If truth be told , I did the Targaryen girl more good than you with all your talk of honor . Let some sellsword drunk on visions of lordship try to kill her . Likely he 'll make a botch of it , and afterward the Dothraki will be on their guard . If we'd sent a Faceless Man after her , she'd be as good as buried . ";Littlefinger;Dothraki,;0.171428571429;7489;233
Ned frowned . " You sit in council and talk of ugly women and steel kisses , and now you expect me to believe that you tried to protect the girl ? How big a fool do you take me for ? ";Ned;Jeyne,Littlefinger,;-0.35;7490;233
" Well , quite an enormous one , actually , " said Littlefinger , laughing .;Littlefinger;Jeyne,Ned,;0.0;7491;233
" Do you always find murder so amusing , Lord Baelish ? ";Ned;Jeyne,Littlefinger,;0.6;7492;233
" It 's not murder I find amusing , Lord Stark , it 's you . You rule like a man dancing on rotten ice . I daresay you will make a noble splash . I believe I heard the first crack this morning . ";Littlefinger;Jeyne,Ned,;0.3125;7493;233
" The first and last , " said Ned . " I 've had my fill . ";Ned;Jeyne,Littlefinger,;0.125;7494;233
" When do you mean to return to Winterfell , my lord ? ";Littlefinger;Jeyne,Ned,;-0.3125;7495;233
" As soon as I can . What concern is that of yours ? ";Ned;Jeyne,Littlefinger,;0.0;7496;233
" None ... but if perchance you 're still here come evenfall , I'd be pleased to take you to this brothel your man Jory has been searching for so ineffectually . ";Jeyne;I'd,Jory,;0.5;7497;233
Littlefinger smiled . " And I wo n't even tell the Lady Catelyn . ";Littlefinger;Catelyn,;0.6;7498;233
" My lady , you should have sent word of your coming , " Ser Donnel Waynwood told her as their horses climbed the pass . " We would have sent an escort . The high road is not as safe as it once was , for a party as small as yours . ";Donnel;Catelyn,;0.136666666667;7502;234
" We learned that to our sorrow , Ser Donnel , " Catelyn said .;Catelyn;Donnel,;0.0;7503;234
Even their names were fading . " The clansmen harried us day and night . We lost three men in the first attack , and two more in the second , and Lannister 's serving man died of a fever when his wounds festered . When we heard your men approaching , I thought us doomed for certain . ";Donnel;Catelyn,;0.192857142857;7505;234
" The clans have grown bolder since Lord Jon died , " Ser Donnel said .;Donnel;Jon,;0.0;7509;234
He was a stocky youth of twenty years , earnest and homely , with a wide nose and a shock of thick brown hair . " If it were up to me , I would take a hundred men into the mountains , root them out of their fastnesses , and teach them some sharp lessons , but your sister has forbidden it . She would not even permit her knights to fight in the Hand 's tourney . She wants all our swords kept close to home , to defend the Vale ... against what , no one is certain . Shadows , some say . ";Donnel;Vale,;-0.0221428571429;7510;234
He looked at her anxiously , as if he had suddenly remembered who she was . " I hope I have not spoken out of turn , my lady . I meant no offense . ";Donnel;Catelyn,;0.0;7511;234
" Frank talk does not offend me , Ser Donnel . ";Catelyn;Frank,;0.0;7512;234
Resolute , she pushed her doubts away . " When we reach your keep , I would take it kindly if you could send for Maester Colemon at once . Ser Rodrik is feverish from his wounds . ";Resolute;Rodrik,;-0.1;7526;235
Ser Donnel hesitated before he answered . " The Lady Lysa has commanded the maester to remain at the Eyrie at all times , to care for Lord Robert , " he said . " We have a septon at the gate who tends to our wounded . He can see to your man 's hurts . ";Donnel;Lysa,;0.0;7530;235
His horse and his armor were grey , but his cloak was the rippling blue-and-red of Riverrun , and a shiny black fish , wrought in gold and obsidian , pinned its folds against his shoulder . " Who would pass the Bloody Gate ? ";Riverrun;Gate,;-0.338888888889;7536;235
" Ser Donnel Waynwood , with the Lady Catelyn Stark and her companions , " the young knight answered .;Catelyn;Resolute,Donnel,Riverrun,Gate,Brynden,;-0.05;7538;235
The Knight of the Gate lifted his visor . " I thought the lady looked familiar . You are far from home , little Cat . ";Gate;Resolute,Donnel,Riverrun,Catelyn,Brynden,;0.0958333333333;7539;235
" And you , Uncle , " she said , smiling despite all she had been through .;Catelyn;Resolute,Donnel,Riverrun,Gate,Brynden,;0.0;7540;235
" My home is at my back , " he said gruffly .;Resolute;Donnel,Riverrun,Gate,Catelyn,Brynden,;0.0;7542;235
" Your home is in my heart , " Catelyn told him . " Take off your helm . I would look on your face again . ";Catelyn;Resolute,Donnel,Riverrun,Gate,Brynden,;0.0;7543;235
" The years have not improved it , I fear , " Brynden Tully said , but when he lifted off the helm , Catelyn saw that he lied .;Catelyn;Resolute,Donnel,Riverrun,Gate,Brynden,;0.0;7544;235
His features were lined and weathered , and time had stolen the auburn from his hair and left him only grey , but the smile was the same , and the bushy eyebrows fat as caterpillars , and the laughter in his deep blue eyes . " Did Lysa know you were coming ? ";Resolute;Lysa,;0.0357142857143;7545;235
" There was no time to send word ahead , " Catelyn told him .;Catelyn;Resolute,Donnel,Riverrun,Gate,Brynden,;0.0;7546;235
The others were coming up behind her . " I fear we ride before the storm , Uncle . ";Resolute;Donnel,Riverrun,Gate,Catelyn,Brynden,;-0.4;7547;235
" May we enter the Vale ? ";Catelyn;Vale,;0.0;7548;235
" In the name of Robert Arryn , Lord of the Eyrie , Defender of the Vale , True Warden of the East , I bid you enter freely , and charge you to keep his peace , " Ser Brynden replied . " Come . ";Brynden;Resolute,Donnel,Riverrun,Gate,Catelyn,;0.35;7551;235
When her uncle saw that she had stopped , he moved his horse closer and pointed . " It 's there , beside Alyssa 's Tears . All you can see from here is a flash of white every now and then , if you look hard and the sun hits the walls just right . ";Marillion;Ned,Brynden,Serrett,Donnel,Bronn,;-0.00198412698413;7562;236
Seven towers , Ned had told her , like white daggers thrust into the belly of the sky , so high you can stand on the parapets and look down on the clouds . " How long a ride ? ";Ned;Brynden,Serrett,Donnel,Marillion,Bronn,;-0.0113888888889;7563;236
" We can be at the mountain by evenfall , " Uncle Brynden said , " but the climb will take another day . ";Brynden;Ned,Serrett,Donnel,Marillion,Bronn,;0.0;7565;236
Ser Rodrik Cassel spoke up from behind . " My lady , " he said , " I fear I can go no farther today . ";Serrett;Ned,Brynden,Donnel,Marillion,Bronn,;-0.4;7566;236
" Nor should you , " she said . " You have done all I could have asked of you , and a hundred times more . My uncle will see me the rest of the way to the Eyrie . Lannister must come with me , but there is no reason that you and the others should not rest here and recover your strength . ";Marillion;Lannister,;0.5;7568;236
" We should be honored to have them to guest , " Ser Donnel said with the grave courtesy of the young .;Donnel;Ned,Brynden,Serrett,Marillion,Bronn,;0.1;7569;236
" My lady , " Marillion said , riding forward . " I beg you allow me to accompany you to the Eyrie , to see the end of the tale as I saw its beginnings . ";Marillion;Ned,Brynden,Serrett,Donnel,Bronn,;0.0;7571;236
Perhaps she owed him something for having come this far . " Very well , " she told him .;Brynden;Ned,Serrett,Donnel,Marillion,Bronn,;0.15;7575;236
" I 'll come as well , " Bronn announced .;Bronn;Ned,Brynden,Serrett,Donnel,Marillion,;0.0;7576;236
She would have preferred to separate him from the dwarf here and now , but having agreed that Marillion might continue to the Eyrie , she could see no gracious way to deny that same right to Bronn . " As you wish , " she said , although she noted that he had not actually asked her permission .;Marillion;Ned,Brynden,Serrett,Donnel,Bronn,;0.142857142857;7582;236
Not until they were a third of the way down the mountain path , well out of earshot of the others , did Brynden Tully turn to her and say , " So , child . Tell me about this storm of yours . ";Tully;Catelyn,;-0.0777777777778;7589;237
" I have not been a child in many years , Uncle , " Catelyn said , but she told him nonetheless .;Catelyn;Tully,;0.5;7590;237
During one of their louder quarrels , when Catelyn was eight , Lord Hoster had called Brynden " the black goat of the Tully flock . ";Catelyn;Tully,;-0.166666666667;7596;237
When she was done , her uncle remained silent for a long time , as his horse negotiated the steep , rocky trail . " Your father must be told , " he said at last . " If the Lannisters should march , Winterfell is remote and the Vale walled up behind its mountains , but Riverrun lies right in their path . ";Tully;Lannister,Riverrun,;-0.0440476190476;7605;238
" I'd had the same fear , " Catelyn admitted . " I shall ask Maester Colemon to send a bird when we reach the Eyrie . ";Catelyn;I'd,Maester,Eyrie,;0.0;7606;238
She had other messages to send as well ; the commands that Ned had given her for his bannermen , to ready the defenses of the north . " What is the mood in the Vale ? ";Ned;Catelyn,Tully,Lysa,Brynden,Tyrion,Black,;0.0375;7607;238
" Angry , " Brynden Tully admitted . " Lord Jon was much loved , and the insult was keenly felt when the king named Jaime Lannister to an office the Arryns had held for near three hundred years . Lysa has commanded us to call her son the True Warden of the East , but no one is fooled . Nor is your sister alone in wondering at the manner of the Hand 's death . None dare say Jon was murdered , not openly , but suspicion casts a long shadow . ";Tully;Jon,Arryn,Lannister,Warden,;0.12;7609;238
He gave Catelyn a look , his mouth tight . " And there is the boy . ";Catelyn;Ned,Tully,Lysa,Brynden,Tyrion,Black,;-0.178571428571;7610;238
" The boy ? What of him ? ";Tully;Catelyn,Ned,Lysa,Brynden,Tyrion,Black,;0.0;7611;238
Her uncle 's voice was troubled . " Lord Robert , " he sighed . " Six years old , sickly , and prone to weep if you take his dolls away . Jon Arryn 's trueborn heir , by all the gods , yet there are some who say he is too weak to sit his father 's seat . Nestor Royce has been high steward these past fourteen years , while Lord Jon served in King 's Landing , and many whisper that he should rule until the boy comes of age . Others believe that Lysa must marry again , and soon . Already the suitors gather like crows on a battlefield . The Eyrie is full of them . ";Lysa;Jon,Lysa,Eyrie,;-0.00214285714286;7613;238
" I might have expected that , " Catelyn said .;Catelyn;Ned,Tully,Lysa,Brynden,Tyrion,Black,;-0.1;7614;238
Small wonder there ; Lysa was still young , and the kingdom of Mountain and Vale made a handsome wedding gift . " Will Lysa take another husband ? ";Lysa;Lysa,;0.116666666667;7615;238
" She says yes , provided she finds a man who suits her , " Brynden Tully said , " but she has already rejected Lord Nestor and a dozen other suitable men . She swears that this time she will choose her lord husband . ";Tully;Catelyn,Ned,Lysa,Brynden,Tyrion,Black,;0.2125;7616;238
" You of all people can scarce fault her for that . ";Catelyn;Ned,Tully,Lysa,Brynden,Tyrion,Black,;0.0;7617;238
Ser Brynden snorted . " Nor do I , but ... it seems to me Lysa is only playing at courtship . She enjoys the sport , but I believe your sister intends to rule herself until her boy is old enough to be Lord of the Eyrie in truth as well as name . ";Brynden;Lysa,Lord,;0.0333333333333;7618;238
" A woman can rule as wisely as a man , " Catelyn said .;Catelyn;Ned,Tully,Lysa,Brynden,Tyrion,Black,;0.0;7619;238
" The right woman can , " her uncle said with a sideways glance . " Make no mistake , Cat . Lysa is not you . ";Tully;Lysa,;0.285714285714;7620;238
He hesitated a moment . " If truth be told , I fear you may not find your sister as ... helpful as you would like . ";Catelyn;Ned,Tully,Lysa,Brynden,Tyrion,Black,;0.0;7621;238
She was puzzled . " What do you mean ? ";Tully;Catelyn,Ned,Lysa,Brynden,Tyrion,Black,;-0.3125;7622;238
" The Lysa who came back from King 's Landing is not the same girl who went south when her husband was named Hand . Those years were hard for her . You must know . Lord Arryn was a dutiful husband , but their marriage was made from politics , not passion . ";Catelyn;Landing,Lord,;-0.0972222222222;7623;238
" As was my own . ";Tully;Catelyn,Ned,Lysa,Brynden,Tyrion,Black,;0.6;7624;238
" They began the same , but your ending has been happier than your sister ' s. Two babes stillborn , twice as many miscarriages , Lord Arryn 's death ... Catelyn , the gods gave Lysa only the one child , and he is all your sister lives for now , poor boy . Small wonder she fled rather than see him handed over to the Lannisters . Your sister is afraid , child , and the Lannisters are what she fears most . She ran to the Vale , stealing away from the Red Keep like a thief in the night , and all to snatch her son out of the lion 's mouth ... and now you have brought the lion to her door . ";Lysa;Lannister,;-0.03125;7625;238
" In chains , " Catelyn said .;Catelyn;Ned,Tully,Lysa,Brynden,Tyrion,Black,;0.0;7626;238
" Oh ? ";Tully;Catelyn,Ned,Lysa,Brynden,Tyrion,Black,;0.0;7629;238
Her uncle glanced back , to where Tyrion Lannister was making his slow descent behind them . " I see an axe on his saddle , a dirk at his belt , and a sellsword that trails after him like a hungry shadow . Where are the chains , sweet one ? ";Tyrion;Catelyn,Ned,Tully,Lysa,Brynden,Black,;-0.0875;7630;238
Catelyn shifted uneasily in her seat . " The dwarf is here , and not by choice . Chains or no , he is my prisoner . Lysa will want him to answer for his crimes no less than I. It was her own lord husband the Lannisters murdered , and her own letter that first warned us against them . ";Catelyn;Lysa,Lannister,;0.320833333333;7631;238
Brynden Blackfish gave her a weary smile . " I hope you are right , child , " he sighed , in tones that said she was wrong .;Black;Catelyn,Ned,Tully,Lysa,Brynden,Tyrion,;0.0285714285714;7632;238
" The Gates of the Moon , " her uncle said as the party drew rein .;Catelyn;;0.0;7641;239
His standard-bearer rode to the edge of the moat to hail the men in the gatehouse . " Lord Nestor 's seat . He should be expecting us . Look up . ";Catelyn;;0.0;7642;239
" The Eyrie , " she heard Marillion murmur , awed .;Catelyn;Tyrion,Brynden,Lord,Yohn,Tully,Lannister,Mya,;0.0;7649;240
The sharp voice of Tyrion Lannister broke in . " The Arryns must not be overfond of company . If you 're planning to make us climb that mountain in the dark , I'd rather you kill me here . ";Tyrion;Arryn,;-0.1375;7650;240
" We 'll spend the night here and make the ascent on the morrow , " Brynden told him .;Brynden;Tyrion,Catelyn,Lord,Yohn,Tully,Lannister,Mya,;0.0;7651;240
" I can scarcely wait , " the dwarf replied . " How do we get up there ? I 've no experience at riding goats . ";Catelyn;Tyrion,Brynden,Lord,Yohn,Tully,Lannister,Mya,;0.0;7652;240
" Mules , " Brynden said , smiling .;Brynden;Tyrion,Catelyn,Lord,Yohn,Tully,Lannister,Mya,;0.0;7653;240
" There are steps carved into the mountain , " Catelyn said .;Catelyn;Tyrion,Brynden,Lord,Yohn,Tully,Lannister,Mya,;0.0;7654;240
Her uncle nodded . " It is too dark to see them , but the steps are there . Too steep and narrow for horses , but mules can manage them most of the way . The path is guarded by three waycastles , Stone and Snow and Sky . The mules will take us as far up as Sky . ";Lord;Tyrion,Brynden,Catelyn,Yohn,Tully,Lannister,Mya,;0.13;7656;240
Tyrion Lannister glanced up doubtfully . " And beyond that ? ";Tyrion;Brynden,Catelyn,Lord,Yohn,Tully,Lannister,Mya,;0.0;7657;240
Brynden smiled . " Beyond that , the path is too steep even for mules . We ascend on foot the rest of the way . Or perchance you'd prefer to ride a basket . The Eyrie clings to the mountain directly above Sky , and in its cellars are six great winches with long iron chains to draw supplies up from below . If you prefer , my lord of Lannister , I can arrange for you to ride up with the bread and beer and apples . ";Brynden;Eyrie,;0.3375;7658;240
The dwarf gave a bark of laughter . " Would that I were a pumpkin , " he said . " Alas , my lord father would no doubt be most chagrined if his son of Lannister went to his fate like a load of turnips . If you ascend on foot , I fear I must do the same . We Lannisters do have a certain pride . ";Lord;Lannister,;0.0785714285714;7659;240
" Pride ? ";Catelyn;Tyrion,Brynden,Lord,Yohn,Tully,Lannister,Mya,;0.0;7660;240
His mocking tone and easy manner made her angry . " Arrogance , some might call it . Arrogance and avarice and lust for power . ";Lord;Tyrion,Brynden,Catelyn,Yohn,Tully,Lannister,Mya,;-0.0333333333333;7662;240
" My brother is undoubtedly arrogant , " Tyrion Lannister replied . " My father is the soul of avarice , and my sweet sister Cersei lusts for power with every waking breath . I , however , am innocent as a little lamb . Shall I bleat for you ? ";Tyrion;Brynden,Catelyn,Lord,Yohn,Tully,Lannister,Mya,;0.220833333333;7663;240
Lord Nestor Royce , High Steward of the Vale and Keeper of the Gates of the Moon , was waiting in the yard to greet them , surrounded by his knights . " Lady Stark , " he said , bowing .;Lord;Tyrion,Brynden,Catelyn,Yohn,Tully,Lannister,Mya,;-0.02;7667;240
Catelyn dismounted to stand before him . " Lord Nestor , " she said .;Catelyn;Tyrion,Brynden,Lord,Yohn,Tully,Lannister,Mya,;0.0;7669;240
She knew the man only by reputation ; Bronze Yohn 's cousin , from a lesser branch of House Royce , yet still a formidable lord in his own right . " We have had a long and tiring journey . I would beg the hospitality of your roof tonight , if I might . ";Yohn;Tyrion,Brynden,Catelyn,Lord,Tully,Lannister,Mya,;0.167142857143;7670;240
" My roof is yours , my lady , " Lord Nestor returned gruffly , " but your sister the Lady Lysa has sent down word from the Eyrie . She wishes to see you at once . The rest of your party will be housed here and sent up at first light . ";Lord;Lysa,;0.164814814815;7671;240
Her uncle swung off his horse . " What madness is this ? ";Catelyn;Tyrion,Brynden,Lord,Yohn,Tully,Lannister,Mya,;0.0;7672;240
Brynden Tully had never been a man to blunt the edge of his words . " A night ascent , with the moon not even full ? Even Lysa should know that 's an invitation to a broken neck . ";Tully;Lysa,;-0.025;7674;240
" The mules know the way , Ser Brynden . ";Lord;Tyrion,Brynden,Catelyn,Yohn,Tully,Lannister,Mya,;0.0;7675;240
She bowed to Catelyn , more gracefully than her lord . " I promise you , my lady , no harm will come to you . It would be my honor to take you up . I 've made the dark climb a hundred times . Mychel says my father must have been a goat . ";Catelyn;Redfort,;0.175;7678;240
She sounded so cocky that Catelyn had to smile . " Do you have a name , child ? ";Catelyn;Tyrion,Brynden,Lord,Yohn,Tully,Lannister,Mya,;0.05;7679;240
" Mya Stone , if it please you , my lady , " the girl said .;Tyrion;Brynden,Catelyn,Lord,Yohn,Tully,Lannister,Mya,;0.0;7680;240
Lord Nestor filled the silence . " Mya 's a clever girl , and if she vows she will bring you safely to the Lady Lysa , I believe her . She has not failed me yet . ";Lord;Mya,;0.0222222222222;7685;240
" Then I put myself in your hands , Mya Stone , " Catelyn said . " Lord Nestor , I charge you to keep a close guard on my prisoner . ";Catelyn;Tyrion,Brynden,Lord,Yohn,Tully,Lannister,Mya,;0.0;7686;240
" And I charge you to bring the prisoner a cup of wine and a nicely crisped capon , before he dies of hunger , " Lannister said . " A girl would be pleasant as well , but I suppose that 's too much to ask of you . ";Lannister;Tyrion,Brynden,Catelyn,Lord,Yohn,Tully,Mya,;0.416666666667;7687;240
Lord Nestor ignored the banter . " As you say , my lady , so it will be done . ";Lord;Tyrion,Brynden,Catelyn,Yohn,Tully,Lannister,Mya,;0.0;7689;240
Only then did he look at the dwarf . " See our lord of Lannister to a tower cell , and bring him meat and mead . ";Catelyn;Tyrion,Brynden,Lord,Yohn,Tully,Lannister,Mya,;0.0;7690;240
Beyond was dense forest of pine and spruce , and the mountain like a black wall , but the steps were there , chiseled deep into the rock , ascending into the sky . " Some people find it easier if they close their eyes , " Mya said as she led the mules through the gate into the dark wood . " When they get frightened or dizzy , sometimes they hold on to the mule too tight . They do n't like that . ";Mya;Tyrion,Brynden,Catelyn,Lord,Yohn,Tully,Lannister,;-0.12380952381;7694;240
" I was born a Tully and wed to a Stark , " Catelyn said . " I do not frighten easily . Do you plan to light a torch ? ";Catelyn;Tully,;0.1;7695;240
The girl made a face . " Torches just blind you . On a clear night like this , the moon and the stars are enough . Mychel says I have the eyes of the owl . ";Lord;Redfort,;-0.133333333333;7697;240
" You mentioned Mychel before , " Catelyn said .;Catelyn;Redfort,;0.0;7700;240
" Mychel 's my love , " Mya explained . " Mychel Redfort . He 's squire to Ser Lyn Corbray . We 're to wed as soon as he becomes a knight , next year or the year after . ";Mya;Tyrion,Brynden,Catelyn,Lord,Yohn,Tully,Lannister,;0.25;7703;240
Perhaps she did doze for a moment , for suddenly a massive ironbound gate was looming before them . " Stone , " Mya announced cheerily , dismounting .;Mya;;0.0;7717;241
Mya had to dismount a half-dozen times to move fallen rocks from their path . " You do n't want your mule to break a leg up here , " she said .;Mya;;0.0;7727;242
The commander , an anxious young knight with a pockmarked face , offered bread and cheese and the chance to warm themselves before his fire , but Mya declined . " We ought to keep going , my lady , " she said . " If it please you . ";Mya;;0.15;7735;243
Mya smiled when she saw him . " Whitey 's a good one , my lady . Sure of foot , even on ice , but you need to be careful . He 'll kick if he does n't like you . ";Mya;White,;0.4125;7739;243
There was no ice either , and she was grateful for that as well . " My mother says that hundreds of years ago , this was where the snow began , " Mya told her . " It was always white above here , and the ice never melted . ";Mya;;0.0;7741;243
She shrugged . " I ca n't remember ever seeing snow this far down the mountain , but maybe it was that way once , in the olden times . ";Mya;;-0.0277777777778;7742;243
When they came to a high saddle between two spires of rock , Mya dismounted . " It 's best to lead the mules over , " she said . " The wind can be a little scary here , my lady . ";Mya;;0.118125;7752;244
" Lady Stark , " Mya called across the gulf .;Mya;Catelyn,;-0.2;7764;245
The girl sounded a thousand leagues away . " Are you well ? ";Mya;Catelyn,;0.0;7765;245
Catelyn Tully Stark swallowed what remained of her pride . " I ... I cannot do this , child , " she called out .;Catelyn;Mya,;-0.2;7766;245
" Yes you can , " the bastard girl said . " I know you can . Look how wide the path is . ";Mya;Catelyn,;-0.1;7767;245
" I do n't want to look . ";Mya;Catelyn,;0.0;7768;245
" I 'll come back for you , " Mya said . " Do n't move , my lady . ";Mya;Catelyn,;0.0;7771;245
Then Mya was there , taking her gently by the arm . " Keep your eyes closed if you like . Let go of the rope now , Whitey will take care of himself . Very good , my lady . I 'll lead you over , it 's easy , you 'll see . Give me a step now . That 's it , move your foot , just slide it forward . See . Now another . Easy . You could run across . Another one , go on . Yes . ";Mya;White,;0.402916666667;7774;245
A mouth yawned in the rock face in front of them . " The stables and barracks are in there , " Mya said . " The last part is inside the mountain . It can be a little dark , but at least you 're out of the wind . This is as far as the mules can go . Past here , well , it 's a sort of chimney , more like a stone ladder than proper steps , but it 's not too bad . Another hour and we 'll be there . ";Mya;Vardis,Maester,Catelyn,;-0.100462962963;7781;246
She remembered what her uncle had said of baskets and winches . " The Lannisters may have their pride , " she told Mya , " but the Tullys are born with better sense . I have ridden all day and the best part of a night . Tell them to lower a basket . I shall ride with the turnips . ";Mya;Lannister,Tully,;0.75;7786;246
Beside him stood Maester Colemon , thin and nervous , with too little hair and too much neck . " Lady Stark , " Ser Vardis said , " the pleasure is as great as it is unanticipated . ";Vardis;Mya,Maester,Catelyn,;0.0225;7789;246
Maester Colemon bobbed his head in agreement . " Indeed it is , my lady , indeed it is . I have sent word to your sister . She left orders to be awakened the instant you arrived . ";Maester;Mya,Vardis,Catelyn,;0.0;7790;246
" I hope she had a good night 's rest , " Catelyn said with a certain bite in her tone that seemed to go unnoticed .;Catelyn;Mya,Vardis,Maester,;0.221428571429;7791;246
A maid stood behind her , brushing out the night 's tangles , but when Catelyn entered , her sister rose to her feet , smiling . " Cat , " she said . " Oh , Cat , how good it is to see you . My sweet sister . ";Catelyn;Lysa,;0.3;7798;247
She ran across the chamber and wrapped her sister in her arms . " How long it has been , " Lysa murmured against her . " Oh , how very very long . ";Lysa;Catelyn,;0.0283333333333;7799;247
" You look well , " Catelyn lied , " but ... tired . ";Catelyn;Maester,Lysa,;-0.4;7809;248
Her sister broke the embrace . " Tired . Yes . Oh , yes . ";Lysa;Catelyn,Maester,;-0.4;7810;248
She seemed to notice the others then ; her maid , Maester Colemon , Ser Vardis . " Leave us , " she told them . " I wish to speak to my sister alone . ";Maester;Catelyn,Lysa,;0.0;7811;248
It was as if the sun had gone behind a cloud . " Have you taken leave of your senses ? ";Catelyn;Maester,Lysa,;-0.4;7816;248
Lysa snapped at her . " To bring him here , without a word of permission , without so much as a warning , to drag us into your quarrels with the Lannisters ... ";Lysa;Catelyn,Maester,;0.1;7817;248
" My quarrels ? ";Catelyn;Maester,Lysa,;0.0;7818;248
A great fire burned in the hearth , but there was no trace of warmth in Lysa 's voice . " They were your quarrels first , sister . It was you who sent me that cursed letter , you who wrote that the Lannisters had murdered your husband . ";Lysa;Lannister,;0.525;7820;248
" To warn you , so you could stay away from them ! I never meant to fight them ! Gods , Cat , do you know what you 've done ? ";Catelyn;Maester,Lysa,;0.0;7821;248
" Mother ? ";Lysa;Catelyn,Maester,;0.0;7822;248
The shaking sickness , the maesters called it . " I heard voices . ";Catelyn;Maester,Lysa,;0.0;7827;248
Still , her sister looked daggers at her . " This is your aunt Catelyn , baby . My sister , Lady Stark . Do you remember ? ";Lysa;Catelyn,;-0.2;7829;248
The boy glanced at her blankly . " I think so , " he said , blinking , though he had been less than a year old the last time Catelyn had seen him .;Catelyn;Maester,Lysa,;-0.0222222222222;7830;248
Lysa seated herself near the fire and said , " Come to Mother , my sweet one . ";Lysa;Catelyn,Maester,;0.225;7831;248
She straightened his bedclothes and fussed with his fine brown hair . " Is n't he beautiful ? And strong too , do n't you believe the things you hear . Jon knew . The seed is strong , he told me . His last words . He kept saying Robert 's name , and he grabbed my arm so hard he left marks . Tell them , the seed is strong . His seed . He wanted everyone to know what a good strong boy my baby was going to be . ";Maester;Jon,Robert,;0.335833333333;7832;248
" Lysa , " Catelyn said , " if you 're right about the Lannisters , all the more reason we must act quickly . We - ";Catelyn;Maester,Lysa,;0.392857142857;7833;248
" Not in front of the baby , " Lysa said . " He has a delicate temper , do n't you , sweet one ? ";Lysa;Catelyn,Maester,;0.025;7834;248
" The boy is Lord of the Eyrie and Defender of the Vale , " Catelyn reminded her , " and these are not times for delicacy . Ned thinks it may come to war . ";Catelyn;Lord,;0.0;7835;248
" Quiet ! ";Maester;Catelyn,Lysa,;0.0;7836;248
Lysa snapped at her . " You 're scaring the boy . ";Lysa;Catelyn,Maester,;0.0;7837;248
His doll fell to the rushes , and he pressed himself against his mother . " Do n't be afraid , my sweet baby , " Lysa whispered . " Mother 's here , nothing will hurt you . ";Lysa;Catelyn,Maester,;-0.125;7839;248
" We 're safe here , " Lysa was saying .;Lysa;Catelyn,Brynden,Robert,;0.5;7847;249
" Do n't be a fool , " Catelyn said , the anger rising in her . " No one is safe . If you think hiding here will make the Lannisters forget you , you are sadly mistaken . ";Catelyn;Lysa,Brynden,Robert,;-0.1;7849;249
Lysa covered her boy 's ear with her hand . " Even if they could bring an army through the mountains and past the Bloody Gate , the Eyrie is impregnable . You saw for yourself . No enemy could ever reach us up here . ";Lysa;Eyrie,Gate,;-0.525;7850;249
Uncle Brynden had tried to warn her , she realized . " No castle is impregnable . ";Brynden;Lysa,Catelyn,Robert,;0.0;7852;249
" This one is , " Lysa insisted . " Everyone says so . The only thing is , what am I to do with this Imp you have brought me ? ";Lysa;Catelyn,Brynden,Robert,;0.0;7853;249
" Is he a bad man ? ";Brynden;Lysa,Catelyn,Robert,;-0.616666666667;7854;249
" A very bad man , " Lysa told him as she covered herself , " but Mother wo n't let him harm my little baby . ";Lysa;Mother,;-0.494583333333;7856;249
" Make him fly , " Robert said eagerly .;Robert;Lysa,Catelyn,Brynden,;0.8;7857;249
Lysa stroked her son 's hair . " Perhaps we will , " she murmured . " Perhaps that is just what we will do . ";Lysa;Catelyn,Brynden,Robert,;0.0;7858;249
Ned paused at the foot of the stair and pulled on his gloves . " It 's time we took our leave . My business here is done . ";Ned;Heward,Littlefinger,;0.0;7866;250
Heward lurched to his feet , hurriedly gathering up his things . " As you will , my lord , " Jory said . " I 'll help Wyl bring round the horses . ";Heward;Wyl,;-0.2;7867;250
He kissed the black woman 's hand , whispered some joke that made her laugh aloud , and sauntered over to Ned . " Your business , " he said lightly , " or Robert ' s ? They say the Hand dreams the king 's dreams , speaks with the king 's voice , and rules with the king 's sword . Does that also mean you fuck with the king ' s - ";Ned;Heward,Littlefinger,;-0.144791666667;7870;250
" Lord Baelish , " Ned interrupted , " you presume too much . I am not ungrateful for your help . It might have taken us years to find this brothel without you . That does not mean I intend to endure your mockery . And I am no longer the King 's Hand . ";Ned;Heward,Littlefinger,;-0.10625;7871;250
" The direwolf must be a prickly beast , " said Littlefinger with a sharp twist of his mouth .;Littlefinger;Ned,Heward,;-0.125;7872;250
" Will we be going back to the castle now , my lord ? ";Ned;Heward,Littlefinger,;0.0;7878;250
" Chataya runs a choice establishment , " Littlefinger said as they rode . " I 've half a mind to buy it . Brothels are a much sounder investment than ships , I 've found . Whores seldom sink , and when they are boarded by pirates , why , the pirates pay good coin like everyone else . ";Littlefinger;Chataya,;0.194444444444;7883;250
" Robert will never keep to one bed , " Lyanna had told him at Winterfell , on the night long ago when their father had promised her hand to the young Lord of Storm 's End. " I hear he has gotten a child on some girl in the Vale . ";Lyanna;Robert,;0.025;7891;251
Lyanna had only smiled . " Love is sweet , dearest Ned , but it cannot change a man 's nature . ";Lyanna;Love,;0.3625;7893;251
She had light red hair and a powdering of freckles across the bridge of her nose , and when she slipped free a breast to give her nipple to the babe , he saw that her bosom was freckled as well . " I named her Barra , " she said as the child nursed . " She looks so like him , does she not , milord ? She has his nose , and his hair ... ";Ned;Barra,;0.266666666667;7896;251
" She does . ";Stark;Lyanna,Ned,Littlefinger,Jory,Lannister,Jaime,;0.0;7897;251
" Tell him that when you see him , milord , as it ... as it please you . Tell him how beautiful she is . ";Littlefinger;Lyanna,Stark,Ned,Jory,Lannister,Jaime,;0.85;7901;251
" I will , " Ned had promised her .;Ned;Lyanna,Stark,Littlefinger,Jory,Lannister,Jaime,;0.0;7902;251
" And tell him I 've not been with no one else . I swear it , milord , by the old gods and new . Chataya said I could have half a year , for the baby , and for hoping he'd come back . So you 'll tell him I 'm waiting , wo n't you ? I do n't want no jewels or nothing , just him . He was always good to me , truly . ";Littlefinger;Chataya,;0.143939393939;7906;251
Good to you , Ned thought hollowly . " I will tell him , child , and I promise you , Barra shall not go wanting . ";Ned;Barra,;0.65;7907;251
If the gods frowned so on bastards , he thought dully , why did they fill men with such lusts ? " Lord Baelish , what do you know of Robert 's bastards ? ";Littlefinger;Lyanna,Stark,Ned,Jory,Lannister,Jaime,;0.0;7910;251
" Well , he has more than you , for a start . ";Ned;Lyanna,Stark,Littlefinger,Jory,Lannister,Jaime,;0.5;7911;251
" How many ? ";Littlefinger;Lyanna,Stark,Ned,Jory,Lannister,Jaime,;0.5;7912;251
Rivulets of moisture twisted down the back of his cloak . " Does it matter ? If you bed enough women , some will give you presents , and His Grace has never been shy on that count . I know he 's acknowledged that boy at Storm 's End , the one he fathered the night Lord Stannis wed . He could hardly do otherwise . The mother was a Florent , niece to the Lady Selyse , one of her bedmaids . Renly says that Robert carried the girl upstairs during the feast , and broke in the wedding bed while Stannis and his bride were still dancing . Lord Stannis seemed to think that was a blot on the honor of his wife 's House , so when the boy was born , he shipped him off to Renly . ";Jaime;Grace,Night,Renly,Lord,;-0.231111111111;7914;251
He gave Ned a sideways glance . " I 've also heard whispers that Robert got a pair of twins on a serving wench at Casterly Rock , three years ago when he went west for Lord Tywin 's tourney . Cersei had the babes killed , and sold the mother to a passing slaver . Too much an affront to Lannister pride , that close to home . ";Ned;Robert,Cersei,;0.1;7915;251
The Robert he had known would not have , but the Robert he had known had never been so practiced at shutting his eyes to things he did not wish to see . " Why would Jon Arryn take a sudden interest in the king 's baseborn children ? ";Littlefinger;Jon,;0.0;7920;251
The short man gave a sodden shrug . " He was the King 's Hand . Doubtless Robert asked him to see that they were provided for . ";Jaime;Robert,King,;0.0;7921;251
Ned was soaked through to the bone , and his soul had grown cold . " It had to be more than that , or why kill him ? ";Ned;Lyanna,Stark,Littlefinger,Jory,Lannister,Jaime,;-0.05;7922;251
Littlefinger shook the rain from his hair and laughed . " Now I see . Lord Arryn learned that His Grace had filled the bellies of some whores and fishwives , and for that he had to be silenced . Small wonder . Allow a man like that to live , and next he 's like to blurt out that the sun rises in the east . ";Littlefinger;Lord,;0.197272727273;7923;251
Rivers of black water were running down the hill when Jory called out , " My lord , " his voice hoarse with alarm .;Jory;Lyanna,Stark,Ned,Littlefinger,Lannister,Jaime,;-0.161111111111;7928;251
He had no time to count , but there were ten at least , a line of them , on foot , blocking the street , with longswords and iron-tipped spears . " Behind ! ";Ned;Lyanna,Stark,Littlefinger,Jory,Lannister,Jaime,;-0.291666666667;7932;251
Jory 's sword came singing from its scabbard . " Make way or die ! ";Jory;Lyanna,Stark,Ned,Littlefinger,Lannister,Jaime,;0.0;7934;251
" The wolves are howling , " their leader said .;Littlefinger;Lyanna,Stark,Ned,Jory,Lannister,Jaime,;0.0;7935;251
Ned could see rain running down his face . " Such a small pack , though . ";Ned;Lyanna,Stark,Littlefinger,Jory,Lannister,Jaime,;-0.135185185185;7936;251
Littlefinger walked his horse forward , step by careful step . " What is the meaning of this ? This is the Hand of the King . ";Littlefinger;Lyanna,Stark,Ned,Jory,Lannister,Jaime,;-0.1;7937;251
" He was the Hand of the King . ";Ned;Lyanna,Stark,Littlefinger,Jory,Lannister,Jaime,;0.0;7938;251
On a golden breastplate , the lion of Lannister roared its defiance . " Now , if truth be told , I 'm not sure what he is . ";Lannister;Lyanna,Stark,Ned,Littlefinger,Jory,Jaime,;0.4;7941;251
" Lannister , this is madness , " Littlefinger said . " Let us pass . We are expected back at the castle . What do you think you 're doing ? ";Littlefinger;Lyanna,Stark,Ned,Jory,Lannister,Jaime,;-0.05;7942;251
" He knows what he 's doing , " Ned said calmly .;Ned;Lyanna,Stark,Littlefinger,Jory,Lannister,Jaime,;0.0;7943;251
Jaime Lannister smiled . " Quite true . I 'm looking for my brother . You remember my brother , do n't you , Lord Stark ? He was with us at Winterfell . Fair-haired , mismatched eyes , sharp of tongue . A short man . ";Lannister;Winterfell,;0.125;7944;251
" I remember him well , " Ned replied .;Ned;Lyanna,Stark,Littlefinger,Jory,Lannister,Jaime,;0.0;7945;251
" It would seem he has met some trouble on the road . My lord father is quite vexed . You would not perchance have any notion of who might have wished my brother ill , would you ? ";Littlefinger;Lyanna,Stark,Ned,Jory,Lannister,Jaime,;-0.5;7946;251
" Your brother has been taken at my command , to answer for his crimes , " Ned Stark said .;Ned;Lyanna,Stark,Littlefinger,Jory,Lannister,Jaime,;-0.2;7947;251
Littlefinger groaned in dismay . " My lords - ";Littlefinger;Lyanna,Stark,Ned,Jory,Lannister,Jaime,;0.0;7948;251
Ser Jaime ripped his longsword from its sheath and urged his stallion forward . " Show me your steel , Lord Eddard . I 'll butcher you like Aerys if I must , but I'd sooner you died with a blade in your hand . ";Jaime;Aerys,;0.0;7949;251
He gave Littlefinger a cool , contemptuous glance . " Lord Baelish , I'd leave here in some haste if I did not care to get bloodstains on my costly clothing . ";Ned;I'd,;0.35;7950;251
Littlefinger did not need to be urged . " I will bring the City Watch , " he promised Ned .;Littlefinger;Lyanna,Stark,Ned,Jory,Lannister,Jaime,;0.0;7951;251
A charge might win them free , but it seemed to Eddard Stark that they had a surer , safer tactic . " Kill me , " he warned the Kingslayer , " and Catelyn will most certainly slay Tyrion . ";Stark;Catelyn,;0.375;7957;251
Jaime Lannister poked at Ned 's chest with the gilded sword that had sipped the blood of the last of the Dragonkings . " Would she ? The noble Catelyn Tully of Riverrun murder a hostage ? I think ... not . ";Lannister;Riverrun,;0.3;7958;251
He sighed . " But I am not willing to chance my brother 's life on a woman 's honor . ";Ned;Lyanna,Stark,Littlefinger,Jory,Lannister,Jaime,;0.25;7959;251
Jaime slid the golden sword into its sheath . " So I suppose I 'll let you run back to Robert to tell him how I frightened you . I wonder if he 'll care . ";Jaime;Lyanna,Stark,Ned,Littlefinger,Jory,Lannister,;0.15;7960;251
When he was beyond the line of swordsmen , he glanced back at his captain . " Tregar , see that no harm comes to Lord Stark . ";Ned;Lyanna,Stark,Littlefinger,Jory,Lannister,Jaime,;-0.1;7962;251
" As you say , m'lord . ";Littlefinger;Lyanna,Stark,Ned,Jory,Lannister,Jaime,;0.0;7963;251
" Still ... we would n't want him to leave here entirely unchastened , so"-through the night and the rain , he glimpsed the white of Jaime 's smile-"kill his men . ";Jaime;Lyanna,Stark,Ned,Littlefinger,Jory,Lannister,;0.0;7964;251
" No ! ";Ned;Lyanna,Stark,Littlefinger,Jory,Lannister,Jaime,;0.0;7965;251
Suddenly Jory was back among them , a red rain flying from his sword . " No ! ";Jory;Ned,;0.0;7978;252
Ned shouted . " Jory , away ! ";Ned;Jory,;0.0;7979;252
Then Grand Maester Pycelle was looming over him , holding a cup , whispering , " Drink , my lord . Here . The milk of the poppy , for your pain . ";Maester;;0.5;7996;253
" Where is the city ? ";Jorah;;0.0;8016;254
" Ahead , " Ser Jorah answered . " Under the mountain . ";Jorah;;0.0;8019;254
" So many , " she said as her silver stepped slowly onward , " and from so many lands . ";Jorah;Viserys,Dany,Aggo,;0.5;8027;255
Viserys was less impressed . " The trash of dead cities , " he sneered .;Viserys;Dany,Aggo,Jorah,;0.211111111111;8028;255
He went on blithely . " All these savages know how to do is steal the things better men have built ... and kill . ";Jorah;Viserys,Dany,Aggo,;0.5;8030;255
He laughed . " They do know how to kill . Otherwise I'd have no use for them at all . ";Viserys;I'd,;0.7;8031;255
" They are my people now , " Dany said . " You should not call them savages , brother . ";Dany;Viserys,Aggo,Jorah,;0.0;8032;255
" The dragon speaks as he likes , " Viserys said ...;Viserys;Dany,Aggo,Jorah,;0.0;8033;255
He glanced over his shoulder at Aggo and Rakharo , riding behind them , and favored them with a mocking smile . " See , the savages lack the wit to understand the speech of civilized men . ";Aggo;Viserys,Dany,Jorah,;0.275;8035;255
Viserys gazed at it with boredom in his eyes . " How long must we linger amidst these ruins before Drogo gives me my army ? I grow tired of waiting . ";Viserys;Drogo,;-0.225;8037;255
" The princess must be presented to the dosh khaleen ... ";Jorah;Viserys,Dany,Aggo,;0.0;8038;255
" The crones , yes , " her brother interrupted , " and there 's to be some mummer 's show of a prophecy for the whelp in her belly , you told me . What is that to me ? I 'm tired of eating horsemeat and I 'm sick of the stink of these savages . ";Dany;Viserys,Aggo,Jorah,;-0.557142857143;8039;255
Ser Jorah Mormont said , " The Western Market will have food more to your taste , Your Grace . The traders from the Free Cities come there to sell their wares . The khal will honor his promise in his own time . ";Jorah;Market,;0.375;8044;255
" He had better , " Viserys said grimly . " I was promised a crown , and I mean to have it . The dragon is not mocked . ";Viserys;Dany,Aggo,Jorah,;0.09375;8045;255
Dany was relieved , yet no less anxious . " I pray that my sun-and-stars will not keep him waiting too long , " she told Ser Jorah when her brother was out of earshot .;Dany;Viserys,Aggo,Jorah,;-0.155555555556;8047;255
The knight looked after Viserys doubtfully . " Your brother should have bided his time in Pentos . There is no place for him in a khalasar . Illyrio tried to warn him . ";Viserys;Illyrio,;0.0;8048;255
" He will go as soon as he has his ten thousand . My lord husband promised a golden crown . ";Dany;Viserys,Aggo,Jorah,;0.15;8049;255
Ser Jorah grunted . " Yes , Khaleesi , but ... the Dothraki look on these things differently than we do in the west . I have told him as much , as Illyrio told him , but your brother does not listen . The horselords are no traders . Viserys thinks he sold you , and now he wants his price . Yet Khal Drogo would say he had you as a gift . He will give Viserys a gift in return , yes ... in his own time . You do not demand a gift , not of a khal . You do not demand anything of a khal . ";Jorah;Illyrio,Viserys,Drogo,;0.3;8050;255
" It is not right to make him wait . ";Viserys;Dany,Aggo,Jorah,;0.285714285714;8051;255
Dany did not know why she was defending her brother , yet she was . " Viserys says he could sweep the Seven Kingdoms with ten thousand Dothraki screamers . ";Dany;Viserys,;0.0;8052;255
Ser Jorah snorted . " Viserys could not sweep a stable with ten thousand brooms . ";Jorah;Viserys,;0.0;8053;255
Dany could not pretend to surprise at the disdain in his tone . " What ... what if it were not Viserys ? ";Dany;Viserys,Aggo,Jorah,;0.0;8054;255
she asked . " If it were someone else who led them ? Someone stronger ? Could the Dothraki truly conquer the Seven Kingdoms ? ";Viserys;Dothraki,;0.0;8055;255
Ser Jorah 's face grew thoughtful as their horses trod together down the godsway . " When I first went into exile , I looked at the Dothraki and saw half-naked barbarians , as wild as their horses . If you had asked me then , Princess , I should have told you that a thousand good knights would have no trouble putting to flight a hundred times as many Dothraki . ";Jorah;Viserys,Dany,Aggo,;0.290740740741;8056;255
" But if I asked you now ? ";Dany;Viserys,Aggo,Jorah,;0.0;8057;255
" Now , " the knight said , " I am less certain . They are better riders than any knight , utterly fearless , and their bows outrange ours . In the Seven Kingdoms , most archers fight on foot , from behind a shieldwall or a barricade of sharpened stakes . The Dothraki fire from horseback , charging or retreating , it makes no matter , they are full as deadly ... and there are so many of them , my lady . Your lord husband alone counts forty thousand mounted warriors in his khalasar . ";Jorah;Viserys,Dany,Aggo,;0.0830357142857;8058;255
" Is that truly so many ? ";Dany;Viserys,Aggo,Jorah,;0.5;8059;255
" Your brother Rhaegar brought as many men to the Trident , " Ser Jorah admitted , " but of that number , no more than a tenth were knights . The rest were archers , freeriders , and foot soldiers armed with spears and pikes . When Rhaegar fell , many threw down their weapons and fled the field . How long do you imagine such a rabble would stand against the charge of forty thousand screamers howling for blood ? How well would boiled leather jerkins and mailed shirts protect them when the arrows fall like rain ? ";Jorah;Rhaegar,;0.215740740741;8060;255
" Not long , " she said , " not well . ";Dany;Viserys,Aggo,Jorah,;-0.05;8061;255
He nodded . " Mind you , Princess , if the lords of the Seven Kingdoms have the wit the gods gave a goose , it will never come to that . The riders have no taste for siegecraft . I doubt they could take even the weakest castle in the Seven Kingdoms , but if Robert Baratheon were fool enough to give them battle ... ";Jorah;Robert,;0.0;8062;255
" Is he ? ";Viserys;Dany,Aggo,Jorah,;0.0;8063;255
Dany asked . " A fool , I mean ? ";Dany;Viserys,Aggo,Jorah,;-0.3125;8064;255
Ser Jorah considered that for a moment . " Robert should have been born Dothraki , " he said at last . " Your khal would tell you that only a coward hides behind stone walls instead of facing his enemy with a blade in hand . The Usurper would agree . He is a strong man , brave ... and rash enough to meet a Dothraki horde in the open field . But the men around him , well , their pipers play a different tune . His brother Stannis , Lord Tywin Lannister , Eddard Stark ... ";Jorah;Robert,Usurper,;0.0703703703704;8065;255
" You hate this Lord Stark , " Dany said .;Dany;Lord,;-0.5;8067;255
" He took from me all I loved , for the sake of a few lice-ridden poachers and his precious honor , " Ser Jorah said bitterly .;Jorah;Viserys,Dany,Aggo,;0.333333333333;8068;255
He changed the subject quickly . " There , " he announced , pointing . " Vaes Dothrak . The city of the horselords . ";Dany;Viserys,Aggo,Jorah,;-0.166666666667;8070;255
In place of walls , some palaces were surrounded by thorny hedges . " None of them are alike , " she said .;Jorah;;0.0;8078;256
" Your brother had part of the truth , " Ser Jorah admitted . " The Dothraki do not build . A thousand years ago , to make a house , they would dig a hole in the earth and cover it with a woven grass roof . The buildings you see were made by slaves brought here from lands they 've plundered , and they built each after the fashion of their own peoples . ";Jorah;Dothraki,;0.6;8079;256
Most of the halls , even the largest , seemed deserted . " Where are the people who live here ? ";Jorah;;0.318181818182;8080;256
" Only the crones of the dosh khaleen dwell permanently in the sacred city , them and their slaves and servants , " Ser Jorah replied , " yet Vaes Dothrak is large enough to house every man of every khalasar , should all the khals return to the Mother at once . The crones have prophesied that one day that will come to pass , and so Vaes Dothrak must be ready to embrace all its children . ";Jorah;Dothraki,;0.103571428571;8083;256
The " palace " was a cavernous wooden feasting hall , its rough-hewn timbered walls rising forty feet , its roof sewn silk , a vast billowing tent that could be raised to keep out the rare rains , or lowered to admit the endless sky .;Jorah;;0.04375;8086;256
Jhiqui had taught her that a bloodrider was more than a guard ; they were the khal 's brothers , his shadows , his fiercest friends . " Blood of my blood , " Drogo called them , and so it was ; they shared a single life .;Jhiqui;;0.214285714286;8099;257
" Khaleesi , " Cohollo said to her , in Dothraki . " Drogo , who is blood of my blood , commands me to tell you that he must ascend the Mother of Mountains this night , to sacrifice to the gods for his safe return . ";Cohollo;Mother,;0.5;8114;258
The khal 's bloodriders would go with him , and return at dawn . " Tell my sun-and-stars that I dream of him , and wait anxious for his return , " she replied , thankful .;khal;Cohollo,earth,Jhiqui,Viserys,Irri,;-0.25;8116;258
It was cool and dim within , like a tent made of earth . " Jhiqui , a bath , please , " she commanded , to wash the dust of travel from her skin and soak her weary bones .;earth;Cohollo,khal,Jhiqui,Viserys,Irri,;0.225;8120;258
The water was scalding hot , as she liked it . " I will give my brother his gifts tonight , " she decided as Jhiqui was washing her hair . " He should look a king in the sacred city . Doreah , run and find him and invite him to sup with me . ";Jhiqui;Cohollo,khal,earth,Viserys,Irri,;0.425;8122;258
Viserys was nicer to the Lysene girl than to her Dothraki handmaids , perhaps because Magister Illyrio had let him bed her back in Pentos . " Irri , go to the bazaar and buy fruit and meat . Anything but horseflesh . ";Viserys;Cohollo,khal,earth,Jhiqui,Irri,;0.0;8123;258
" Horse is best , " Irri said . " Horse makes a man strong . ";Irri;Horse,;0.716666666667;8124;258
" Viserys hates horsemeat . ";earth;Viserys,;0.0;8125;258
" As you say , Khaleesi . ";Jhiqui;Cohollo,khal,earth,Viserys,Irri,;0.0;8126;258
Her eye was red where he'd hit her . " How dare you send this whore to give me commands , " he said .;Viserys;Dany,Jhiqui,;0.0;8134;259
The anger took Dany utterly by surprise . " I only wanted ... Doreah , what did you say ? ";Dany;Viserys,Jhiqui,;-0.35;8136;259
" Khaleesi , pardons , forgive me . I went to him , as you bid , and told him you commanded him to join you for supper . ";Jhiqui;Viserys,Dany,;0.0;8137;259
" No one commands the dragon , " Viserys snarled . " I am your king ! I should have sent you back her head ! ";Viserys;Dany,Jhiqui,;0.0;8138;259
The Lysene girl quailed , but Dany calmed her with a touch . " Do n't be afraid , he wo n't hurt you . Sweet brother , please , forgive her , the girl misspoke herself , I told her to ask you to sup with me , if it pleases Your Grace . ";Dany;Grace,;-0.125;8139;259
She took him by the hand and drew him across the room . " Look . These are for you . ";Jhiqui;Viserys,Dany,;0.0;8140;259
Viserys frowned suspiciously . " What is all this ? ";Viserys;Dany,Jhiqui,;0.0;8141;259
" New raiment . I had it made for you . ";Jhiqui;Viserys,Dany,;0.136363636364;8142;259
He looked at her and sneered . " Dothraki rags . Do you presume to dress me now ? ";Dany;Viserys,Jhiqui,;0.0;8144;259
" Please ... you 'll be cooler and more comfortable , and I thought ... maybe if you dressed like them , the Dothraki ... ";Viserys;Dany,Jhiqui,;0.45;8145;259
" Next you 'll want to braid my hair . ";Dany;Viserys,Jhiqui,;0.0;8147;259
" I'd never ... ";Viserys;Dany,Jhiqui,;0.0;8148;259
She had only wanted to help . " You have no right to a braid , you have won no victories yet . ";Dany;Viserys,Jhiqui,;0.142857142857;8150;259
Viserys picked up the cloak and sniffed at it . " This stinks of manure . Perhaps I shall use it as a horse blanket . ";Viserys;Dany,Jhiqui,;0.0;8153;259
" I had Doreah sew it specially for you , " she told him , wounded . " These are garments fit for a khal . ";Dany;Doreah,;0.4;8154;259
" I am the Lord of the Seven Kingdoms , not some grass-stained savage with bells in his hair , " Viserys spat back at her .;Viserys;Lord,;0.0;8155;259
He grabbed her arm . " You forget yourself , slut . Do you think that big belly will protect you if you wake the dragon ? ";Jhiqui;Viserys,Dany,;0.0;8156;259
Blood ran down his cheek where the edge of one of the medallions had sliced it open . " You are the one who forgets himself , " Dany said to him . " Did n't you learn anything that day in the grass ? Leave me now , before I summon my khas to drag you out . And pray that Khal Drogo does not hear of this , or he will cut open your belly and feed you your own entrails . ";Dany;Drogo,;0.111111111111;8162;259
Viserys scrambled back to his feet . " When I come into my kingdom , you will rue this day , slut . ";Viserys;Dany,Jhiqui,;0.0;8163;259
" Your supper is ready , Khaleesi , " Jhiqui announced .;Jhiqui;Viserys,Dany,;0.2;8167;259
" I 'm not hungry , " Dany said sadly .;Dany;Viserys,Jhiqui,;0.0;8168;259
She was suddenly very tired . " Share the food among yourselves , and send some to Ser Jorah , if you would . ";Viserys;Dany,Jhiqui,;-0.52;8169;259
After a moment she added , " Please , bring me one of the dragon 's eggs . ";Jhiqui;Viserys,Dany,;0.0;8170;259
as if he were reaching out , brother to brother , blood to blood . " You are the dragon , " Dany whispered to him , " the true dragon . I know it . I know it . ";Dany;Viserys,Jhiqui,;0.35;8176;259
" Are you ready ? ";Robb;Bran,;0.2;8185;260
" Let 's ride , then . ";Robb;Bran,;0.0;8189;260
" Go , " Bran whispered to his own horse .;Bran;Robb,;0.6;8191;260
Theon spurred his mount to move up beside Robb . " Sweet Kyra , " he said with a laugh . " She squirms like a weasel in bed , but say a word to her on the street , and she blushes pink as a maid . Did I ever tell you about the night that she and Bessa - ";Theon;Robb,Bran,;0.183333333333;8220;261
" Not where my brother can hear , Theon , " Robb warned him with a glance at Bran .;Robb;Theon,Bran,;0.0;8221;261
Robb rode closer . " You are doing well , Bran . ";Robb;Theon,Bran,;0.0;8226;261
" I want to go faster , " Bran replied .;Bran;Theon,Robb,;0.0;8227;261
Robb smiled . " As you will . ";Robb;Theon,Bran,;0.6;8228;261
By the time he caught Robb on the edge of the wolfswood , two miles beyond the winter town , they had left the others well behind . " I can ride ! ";Robb;Bran,;-0.25;8238;262
" I'd race you , but I fear you'd win . ";Robb;Bran,;0.8;8241;262
" I do n't want to race . ";Robb;Bran,;0.0;8243;262
Both had vanished into the wood . " Did you hear Summer howling last night ? ";Robb;Summer,;0.0;8245;262
" Grey Wind was restless too , " Robb said .;Robb;Greyjoy,;-0.05;8246;262
His auburn hair had grown shaggy and unkempt , and a reddish stubble covered his jaw , making him look older than his fifteen years . " Sometimes I think they know things ... sense things ... ";Robb;Bran,;0.166666666667;8247;262
Robb sighed . " I never know how much to tell you , Bran . I wish you were older . ";Robb;Bran,;0.133333333333;8248;262
" I 'm eight now ! ";Robb;Bran,;0.0;8249;262
Bran said . " Eight is n't so much younger than fifteen , and I 'm the heir to Winterfell , after you . ";Bran;Robb,;0.0;8250;262
" So you are . ";Robb;Bran,;0.0;8251;262
Robb sounded sad , and even a little scared . " Bran , I need to tell you something . There was a bird last night . From King 's Landing . Maester Luwin woke me . ";Robb;Maester,;-0.229166666667;8252;262
Bran clung to hope . " Was the bird from Mother ? Is she coming home ? ";Bran;Robb,Jory,Hall,Lord,Theon,Maester,;0.0;8265;263
" The message was from Alyn in King 's Landing . Jory Cassel is dead . And Wyl and Heward as well . Murdered by the Kingslayer . ";Theon;Jory,;-0.2;8266;263
Robb lifted his face to the snow , and the flakes melted on his cheeks . " May the gods give them rest . ";Robb;Bran,Jory,Hall,Lord,Theon,Maester,;0.0;8267;263
Jory had been captain of the household guard at Winterfell since before Bran was born . " They killed Jory ? ";Jory;Jory,;0.0;8270;263
He could picture him striding across the yard in mail and plate , or sitting at his accustomed place on the bench in the Great Hall , joking as he ate . " Why would anyone kill Jory ? ";Hall;Jory,;0.8;8272;263
Robb shook his head numbly , the pain plain in his eyes . " I do n't know , and ... Bran , that 's not the worst of it . Father was caught beneath a falling horse in the fight . Alyn says his leg was shattered , and ... Maester Pycelle has given him the milk of the poppy , but they are n't sure when ... when he ... ";Robb;Father,Maester,;-0.238095238095;8273;263
The sound of hoofbeats made him glance down the road , to where Theon and the others were coming up . " When he will wake , " Robb finished .;Robb;Bran,Jory,Hall,Lord,Theon,Maester,;0.122222222222;8274;263
He laid his hand on the pommel of his sword then , and went on in the solemn voice of Robb the Lord . " Bran , I promise you , whatever might happen , I will not let this be forgotten . ";Lord;Bran,Robb,Jory,Hall,Theon,Maester,;0.0;8275;263
Something in his tone made Bran even more fearful . " What will you do ? ";Bran;Robb,Jory,Hall,Lord,Theon,Maester,;-0.2;8276;263
" Theon thinks I should call the banners , " Robb said .;Robb;Theon,;0.0;8278;263
" Blood for blood . ";Theon;Bran,Robb,Jory,Hall,Lord,Maester,;0.0;8279;263
" Only the lord can call the banners , " Bran said as the snow drifted down around them .;Bran;Robb,Jory,Hall,Lord,Theon,Maester,;-0.0777777777778;8282;263
" If your father dies , " Theon said , " Robb will be Lord of Winterfell . ";Theon;Robb,;0.0;8283;263
" He wo n't die ! ";Bran;Robb,Jory,Hall,Lord,Theon,Maester,;0.0;8284;263
Robb took his hand . " He wo n't die , not Father , " he said calmly . " Still ... the honor of the north is in my hands now . When our lord father took his leave of us , he told me to be strong for you and for Rickon . I 'm almost a man grown , Bran . ";Robb;Bran,Jory,Hall,Lord,Theon,Maester,;0.433333333333;8286;263
Bran shivered . " I wish Mother was back , " he said miserably .;Bran;Mother,;0.0;8287;263
He looked around for Maester Luwin ; his donkey was visible in the far distance , trotting over a rise . " Does Maester Luwin say to call the banners too ? ";Maester;Maester,;0.1;8288;263
" The maester is timid as an old woman , " said Theon .;Theon;Bran,Robb,Jory,Hall,Lord,Maester,;0.1;8289;263
" Father always listened to his counsel , " Bran reminded his brother . " Mother too . ";Bran;Father,;0.0;8290;263
" I listen to him , " Robb insisted . " I listen to everyone . ";Robb;Bran,Jory,Hall,Lord,Theon,Maester,;0.0;8291;263
Not so long ago , the thought of Robb calling the banners and riding off to war would have filled him with excitement , but now he felt only dread . " Can we go back now ? ";Robb;Bran,Jory,Hall,Lord,Theon,Maester,;0.0875;8293;263
he asked . " I 'm cold . ";Bran;Robb,Jory,Hall,Lord,Theon,Maester,;-0.6;8294;263
Robb glanced around . " We need to find the wolves . Can you stand to go a bit longer ? ";Robb;Bran,Jory,Hall,Lord,Theon,Maester,;0.0;8295;263
" I can go as long as you can . ";Bran;Robb,Jory,Hall,Lord,Theon,Maester,;-0.05;8296;263
" Let 's hunt down the hunters , then , " Robb said .;Robb;Bran,Jory,Hall,Lord,Theon,Maester,;-0.155555555556;8299;263
" Bran ? ";Robb;Bran,;0.0;8311;264
Robb asked . " What 's wrong ? ";Robb;Bran,;-0.5;8312;264
Bran shook his head . " I was just remembering , " he said . " Jory brought us here once , to fish for trout . You and me and Jon . Do you remember ? ";Bran;Jory,;0.0;8313;264
" I remember , " Robb said , his voice quiet and sad .;Robb;Bran,;-0.25;8314;264
" I did n't catch anything , " Bran said , " but Jon gave me his fish on the way back to Winterfell . Will we ever see Jon again ? ";Bran;Jon,;0.0;8315;264
" We saw Uncle Benjen when the king came to visit , " Robb pointed out . " Jon will visit too , you 'll see . ";Robb;Benjen,;0.0;8316;264
Bran raised his head to listen . " Summer , " he said .;Bran;Robb,;0.0;8326;265
" They 've made a kill , " Robb said as he remounted , " I'd best go and bring them back . Wait here , Theon and the others should be along shortly . ";Robb;Bran,;0.5;8328;265
" I want to go with you , " Bran said .;Bran;Robb,;0.0;8329;265
" I 'll find them faster by myself . ";Bran;Robb,;0.0;8330;265
" Good day to you , " he said nervously .;Bran;Greyjoy,;0.65;8339;266
" All alone , are you ? ";Bran;Greyjoy,;0.0;8344;266
said the biggest of them , a bald man with a raw windburnt face . " Lost in the wolfswood , poor lad . ";Bran;Greyjoy,;-0.315384615385;8345;266
" I 'm not lost . ";Bran;Greyjoy,;0.0;8346;266
He counted four , but when he turned his head , he saw two others behind him . " My brother rode off just a moment ago , and my guard will be here shortly . ";Bran;Greyjoy,;-0.4;8348;266
" Your guard , is it ? ";Bran;Greyjoy,;0.0;8349;266
Grey stubble covered his gaunt face . " And what would they be guarding , my little lord ? Is that a silver pin I see there on your cloak ? ";Greyjoy;Bran,;-0.11875;8351;266
" Pretty , " said a woman 's voice .;Bran;Greyjoy,;0.25;8352;266
" Let 's have a look , " said the big bald man .;Bran;Greyjoy,;0.0;8355;266
" The pin , lad , " the big man said .;Bran;Robb,Stiv,;0.0;8362;267
" We 'll take the horse too , " said another of them , a woman shorter than Robb , with a broad flat face and lank yellow hair . " Get down , and be quick about it . ";Robb;Bran,Stiv,;0.0430555555556;8364;267
" No , " Bran blurted . " I ca n't ... ";Bran;Robb,Stiv,;0.0;8366;267
The big man grabbed his reins before Bran could think to wheel Dancer around and gallop off . " You can , lordling ... and will , if you know what 's good for you . ";Bran;Robb,Stiv,;0.325;8367;267
" Stiv , look how he 's strapped on . ";Stiv;Robb,Bran,;0.0;8368;267
The tall woman pointed with her spear . " Might be it 's the truth he 's telling . ";Bran;Robb,Stiv,;0.0;8369;267
" Straps , is it ? ";Stiv;Robb,Bran,;0.0;8370;267
He drew a dagger from a sheath at his belt . " There 's ways to deal with straps . ";Bran;Robb,Stiv,;0.0;8372;267
" You some kind of cripple ? ";Stiv;Robb,Bran,;0.6;8373;267
Bran flared . " I 'm Brandon Stark of Winterfell , and you better let go of my horse , or I 'll see you all dead . ";Bran;Bran,;0.0333333333333;8375;267
The gaunt man with the grey stubbled face laughed . " The boy 's a Stark , true enough . Only a Stark would be fool enough to threaten where smarter men would beg . ";Stiv;Stark,;0.075;8376;267
" Cut his little cock off and stuff it in his mouth , " suggested the short woman . " That should shut him up . ";Bran;Robb,Stiv,;-0.09375;8377;267
" You 're as stupid as you are ugly , Hali , " said the tall woman . " The boy 's worth nothing dead , but alive ... gods be damned , think what Mance would give to have Benjen Stark 's own blood to hostage ! ";Stiv;Mance,;-0.110714285714;8378;267
" Mance be damned , " the big man cursed . " You want to go back there , Osha ? More fool you . Think the white walkers will care if you have a hostage ? ";Bran;Mance,;0.125;8379;267
" Put down your steel now , and I promise you shall have a quick and painless death , " Robb called out .;Robb;Hal,Osha,Bran,;0.0888888888889;8387;268
" The brother , " said the man with the grey stubbly face .;Hal;Robb,Osha,Bran,;-0.05;8391;268
" He 's a fierce one , he is , " mocked the short woman .;Robb;Hal,Osha,Bran,;0.0;8392;268
Hali , they called her . " You mean to fight us , boy ? ";Hal;Robb,Osha,Bran,;-0.3125;8393;268
" Do n't be a fool , lad . You 're one against six . ";Robb;Hal,Osha,Bran,;0.0;8394;268
The tall woman , Osha , leveled her spear . " Off the horse , and throw down the sword . We 'll thank you kindly for the mount and for the venison , and you and your brother can be on your way . ";Osha;Robb,Hal,Bran,;-0.155555555556;8395;268
" Wolves , " gasped Hali .;Hal;Robb,Osha,Bran,;0.0;8400;268
" Direwolves , " Bran said .;Bran;Robb,Hal,Osha,;0.0;8401;268
" Dogs , " the big bald man said contemptuously . " Yet I 'm told there 's nothing like a wolfskin cloak to warm a man by night . ";Hal;Robb,Osha,Bran,;0.3;8407;268
He made a sharp gesture . " Take them . ";Osha;Robb,Hal,Bran,;-0.125;8408;268
Robb shouted , " Winterfell ! ";Robb;Hal,Osha,Bran,;0.0;8409;268
He could not feel the cold of the water , but he felt the steel when Stiv pressed his dagger to his throat . " Back away , " the man warned , " or I 'll open the boy 's windpipe , I swear it . ";Stiv;;-0.2;8437;269
Grey Wind padded toward her , dripping wet . " Call him off ! ";Greyjoy;Robb,;-0.09375;8445;270
the big man shouted . " Call them both off , or the cripple boy dies now ! ";Greyjoy;Robb,;0.0;8446;270
" Grey Wind , Summer , to me , " Robb said .;Robb;Greyjoy,;-0.05;8447;270
Stiv was as scared as he was , he realized . " Starks , " the man muttered , " bloody Starks . ";Stiv;Robb,Bran,;-0.8;8456;271
He raised his voice . " Osha , kill the wolves and get his sword . ";Robb;Stiv,Bran,;0.0;8457;271
" Kill them yourself , " she replied . " I 'll not be getting near those monsters . ";Stiv;Robb,Bran,;0.1;8458;271
The stench of the man filled his nose ; he smelled of fear . " You , " he called out to Robb . " You have a name ? ";Robb;Stiv,Bran,;0.4;8461;271
" I am Robb Stark , the heir to Winterfell . ";Stiv;Robb,;-0.2;8462;271
" This is your brother ? ";Robb;Stiv,Bran,;0.0;8463;271
" Yes . ";Stiv;Robb,Bran,;0.0;8464;271
" You want him alive , you do what I say . Off the horse . ";Robb;Stiv,Bran,;0.1;8465;271
" Now kill the wolves . ";Stiv;Robb,Bran,;0.0;8468;271
" You do it . The wolves or the boy . ";Robb;Stiv,Bran,;0.0;8470;271
" No ! ";Stiv;Robb,Bran,;0.0;8471;271
The bald man took hold of his hair with his free hand and twisted it cruelly , till Bran sobbed in pain . " You shut your mouth , cripple , you hear me ? ";Bran;Stiv,Robb,;-0.05;8474;271
He twisted harder . " You hear me ? ";Robb;Stiv,Bran,;-0.3;8475;271
She threw down her spear . " Mercy , m'lord , " she called to Robb .;Robb;Bran,Quent,Theon,Maester,Greyjoy,;-0.155555555556;8484;272
Then he shook his head and waded across the stream to Bran 's side . " Are you hurt ? ";Bran;Robb,Quent,Theon,Maester,Greyjoy,;0.0;8488;272
" He cut my leg , " Bran said , " but I could n't feel it . ";Bran;Robb,Quent,Theon,Maester,Greyjoy,;0.0;8489;272
A half-dozen arrows were thrust into the soft ground at his feet , but it had taken only one . " A dead enemy is a thing of beauty , " he announced .;Maester;Robb,Bran,Quent,Theon,Greyjoy,;-0.0333333333333;8494;272
" Jon always said you were an ass , Greyjoy , " Robb said loudly . " I ought to chain you up in the yard and let Bran take a few practice shots at you . ";Robb;always,Bran,;-0.2;8495;272
" You should be thanking me for saving your brother 's life . ";Bran;Robb,Quent,Theon,Maester,Greyjoy,;0.0;8496;272
" What if you had missed the shot ? ";Maester;Robb,Bran,Quent,Theon,Greyjoy,;0.0;8497;272
Robb said . " What if you'd only wounded him ? What if you had made his hand jump , or hit Bran instead ? For all you knew , the man might have been wearing a breastplate , all you could see was the back of his cloak . What would have happened to my brother then ? Did you ever think of that , Greyjoy ? ";Robb;Bran,;0.0;8498;272
Robb glared at his guardsmen . " Where were you ? ";Robb;Bran,Quent,Theon,Maester,Greyjoy,;0.0;8501;272
he demanded of them . " I was sure you were close behind us . ";Bran;Robb,Quent,Theon,Maester,Greyjoy,;0.05;8502;272
The men traded unhappy glances . " We were following , m'lord , " said Quent , the youngest of them , his beard a soft brown fuzz . " Only first we waited for Maester Luwin and his ass , begging your pardons , and then , well , as it were ... ";Quent;Robb,Bran,Theon,Maester,Greyjoy,;-0.05;8503;272
" I spied a turkey , " Theon said , annoyed by the question . " How was I to know that you'd leave the boy alone ? ";Theon;Robb,Bran,Quent,Maester,Greyjoy,;-0.4;8505;272
Finally he knelt beside Maester Luwin . " How badly is my brother wounded ? ";Maester;Robb,Bran,Quent,Theon,Greyjoy,;0.0;8508;272
" No more than a scratch , " the maester said .;Bran;Robb,Quent,Theon,Maester,Greyjoy,;0.5;8509;272
He wet a cloth in the stream to clean the cut . " Two of them wear the black , " he told Robb as he worked .;Robb;Bran,Quent,Theon,Maester,Greyjoy,;0.0333333333333;8510;272
Robb glanced over at where Stiv lay sprawled in the stream , his ragged black cloak moving fitfully as the rushing waters tugged at it . " Deserters from the Night 's Watch , " he said grimly . " They must have been fools , to come so close to Winterfell . ";Robb;Bran,Quent,Theon,Maester,Greyjoy,;-0.166666666667;8511;272
" Folly and desperation are ofttimes hard to tell apart , " said Maester Luwin .;Maester;Robb,Bran,Quent,Theon,Greyjoy,;-0.291666666667;8512;272
" Shall we bury them , m'lord ? ";Bran;Robb,Quent,Theon,Maester,Greyjoy,;0.0;8513;272
" They would not have buried us , " Robb said . " Hack off their heads , we 'll send them back to the Wall . Leave the rest for the carrion crows . ";Robb;Bran,Quent,Theon,Maester,Greyjoy,;0.0;8515;272
" And this one ? ";Bran;Robb,Quent,Theon,Maester,Greyjoy,;0.0;8516;272
She was a head taller than he was , but she dropped to her knees at his approach . " Give me my life , m'lord of Stark , and I am yours . ";Robb;Bran,Quent,Theon,Maester,Greyjoy,;-0.2;8519;272
" Mine ? What would I do with an oathbreaker ? ";Bran;Robb,Quent,Theon,Maester,Greyjoy,;0.0;8520;272
" I broke no oaths . Stiv and Wallen flew down off the Wall , not me . The black crows got no place for women . ";Robb;Stiv,;-0.161111111111;8521;272
Theon Greyjoy sauntered closer . " Give her to the wolves , " he urged Robb .;Greyjoy;Robb,Bran,Quent,Theon,Maester,;0.0;8522;272
" She 's a woman , " Robb said .;Robb;Bran,Quent,Theon,Maester,Greyjoy,;0.0;8526;272
" A wildling , " Bran told him . " She said they should keep me alive so they could take me to Mance Rayder . ";Bran;Robb,Quent,Theon,Maester,Greyjoy,;0.1;8527;272
" Do you have a name ? ";Robb;Bran,Quent,Theon,Maester,Greyjoy,;0.0;8528;272
" Osha , as it please the lord , " she muttered sourly .;Bran;Robb,Quent,Theon,Maester,Greyjoy,;0.0;8530;272
Maester Luwin stood . " We might do well to question her . ";Maester;Robb,Bran,Quent,Theon,Greyjoy,;0.0;8531;272
Bran could see the relief on his brother 's face . " As you say , Maester . Wayn , bind her hands . She 'll come back to Winterfell with us ... and live or die by the truths she gives us . ";Bran;Robb,Quent,Theon,Maester,Greyjoy,;0.0681818181818;8532;272
" You want eat ? ";Tyrion;Mordane,;0.0;8536;273
Tyrion Lannister was starved , but he refused to let this brute see him cringe . " A leg of lamb would be pleasant , " he said , from the heap of soiled straw in the corner of his cell . " Perhaps a dish of peas and onions , some fresh baked bread with butter , and a flagon of mulled wine to wash it down . Or beer , if that 's easier . I try not to be overly particular . ";Tyrion;Mordane,;0.261111111111;8539;273
" Is beans , " Mord said . " Here . ";Mordane;Tyrion,;0.0;8540;273
Mord jerked it away , grinning . " Is here , " he said , holding it out beyond Tyrion 's reach .;Mordane;Tyrion,;0.0;8547;274
The dwarf climbed stiffly to his feet , every joint aching . " Must we play the same fool 's game with every meal ? ";Mordane;Tyrion,;-0.2;8548;274
Mord shambled backward , grinning through his rotten teeth . " Is here , dwarf man . ";Mordane;Tyrion,;0.0;8550;274
He held the plate out at arm 's length , over the edge where the cell ended and the sky began . " You not want eat ? Here . Come take . ";Mordane;Tyrion,;0.0;8551;274
All it would take would be a quick shove of Mord 's heavy white belly , and he would end up a sickening red splotch on the stones of Sky , like so many other prisoners of the Eyrie over the centuries . " Come to think on it , I 'm not hungry after all , " he declared , retreating to the corner of his cell .;Mordane;Tyrion,;-0.0559523809524;8553;274
Tyrion felt a pang of rage . " You fucking son of a pox-ridden ass , " he spat . " I hope you die of a bloody flux . ";Tyrion;Mordane,;-0.7;8558;274
For that , Mord gave him a kick , driving a steel-toed boot hard into Tyrion 's ribs on the way out . " I take it back ! ";Mordane;Tyrion,;-0.182291666667;8559;274
he gasped as he doubled over on the straw . " I 'll kill you myself , I swear it ! ";Mordane;Tyrion,;0.0;8560;274
" You fly , " Mord had promised him , when he'd shoved him into the cell . " Twenty day , thirty , fifty maybe . Then you fly . ";Mordane;;0.8;8571;275
Tyrion Lannister had been looked down on all his life , but seldom by rheumy-eyed six-year-olds who needed to stuff fat cushions under their cheeks to lift them to the height of a man . " Is he the bad man ? ";Tyrion;Lysa,Eyrie,High,;-0.386111111111;8585;276
" He is , " the Lady Lysa had said from the lesser throne beside him .;Lysa;Tyrion,Eyrie,High,;0.0;8587;276
" He 's so small , " the Lord of the Eyrie said , giggling .;Eyrie;Tyrion,Lysa,High,;-0.25;8589;276
" This is Tyrion the Imp , of House Lannister , who murdered your father . ";Lysa;Tyrion,;0.0;8590;276
She raised her voice so it carried down the length of High Hall of the Eyrie , ringing off the milk-white walls and the slender pillars , so every man could hear it . " He slew the Hand of the King ! ";High;Tyrion,Lysa,Eyrie,;0.00277777777778;8591;276
" Oh , did I kill him too ? ";Lysa;Tyrion,Eyrie,High,;0.0;8592;276
Bronn had carried him the rest of the way , and the humiliation poured oil on the flames of his anger . " It would seem I 've been a busy little fellow , " he said with bitter sarcasm . " I wonder when I found the time to do all this slaying and murdering . ";Bronn;Lysa,Tyrion,Robert,Arryn,Catelyn,;-0.221875;8601;277
" Imp , " Lysa said coldly , " you will guard that mocking tongue of yours and speak to my son politely , or I promise you will have cause to regret it . Remember where you are . This is the Eyrie , and these are knights of the Vale you see around you , true men who loved Jon Arryn well . Every one of them would die for me . ";Lysa;Eyrie,;0.525;8604;277
" Lady Arryn , should any harm come to me , my brother Jaime will be pleased to see that they do . ";Tyrion;Jaime,;0.5;8605;277
" Can you fly , my lord of Lannister ? ";Robert;Bronn,Lysa,Tyrion,Arryn,Catelyn,;0.8;8607;277
Lady Lysa asked . " Does a dwarf have wings ? If not , you would be wiser to swallow the next threat that comes to mind . ";Lysa;Bronn,Tyrion,Robert,Arryn,Catelyn,;0.0;8608;277
" I made no threats , " Tyrion said . " That was a promise . ";Tyrion;Bronn,Lysa,Robert,Arryn,Catelyn,;0.0;8609;277
Little Lord Robert hopped to his feet at that , so upset he dropped his doll . " You ca n't hurt us , " he screamed . " No one can hurt us here . Tell him , Mother , tell him he ca n't hurt us here . ";Robert;Bronn,Lysa,Tyrion,Arryn,Catelyn,;-0.1875;8610;277
" The Eyrie is impregnable , " Lysa Arryn declared calmly .;Arryn;Eyrie,;0.0;8612;277
She drew her son close , holding him safe in the circle of her plump white arms . " The Imp is trying to frighten us , sweet baby . The Lannisters are all liars . No one will hurt my sweet boy . ";Lysa;Imp,;0.3;8613;277
Still , Tyrion had been unable to silence himself . " Not impregnable , " he said , " merely inconvenient . ";Tyrion;Bronn,Lysa,Robert,Arryn,Catelyn,;-0.55;8618;277
Young Robert pointed down , his hand trembling . " You 're a liar . Mother , I want to see him fly . ";Robert;Bronn,Lysa,Tyrion,Arryn,Catelyn,;0.248148148148;8619;277
The gods only know what might have happened then were it not for Catelyn Stark . " Sister , " she called out from where she stood below the thrones , " I beg you to remember , this man is my prisoner . I will not have him harmed . ";Catelyn;Bronn,Lysa,Tyrion,Robert,Arryn,;-0.1;8621;277
" My sister 's little guest is too weary to stand , " Lady Lysa announced . " Ser Vardis , take him down to the dungeon . A rest in one of our sky cells will do him much good . ";Lysa;Bronn,Tyrion,Robert,Arryn,Catelyn,;0.102314814815;8627;277
Tyrion Lannister dangled between them , kicking feebly , his face red with shame . " I will remember this , " he told them all as they carried him off .;Tyrion;Bronn,Lysa,Robert,Arryn,Catelyn,;0.0;8629;277
He hammered on the door with a fist . " Mord ! ";Tyrion;Mordane,;0.0;8675;278
he shouted . " Turnkey ! Mord , I want you ! ";Tyrion;Mordane,;0.0;8676;278
" Making noise , " Mord growled , with blood in his eyes .;Mordane;Tyrion,;0.0;8679;278
Never show them you 're afraid , Tyrion reminded himself . " How would you like to be rich ? ";Tyrion;Mordane,;-0.1125;8681;278
The force of it staggered him , and the pain made him grit his teeth . " No mouth , dwarf man , " Mord warned him .;Mordane;Tyrion,;0.0;8685;278
" Gold , " Tyrion said , miming a smile . " Casterly Rock is full of gold ... ahhhh ... ";Tyrion;Rock,;0.325;8686;278
He forced himself to look up at the gaoler . " As rich as the Lannisters , " he wheezed . " That 's what they say , Mord - ";Tyrion;Mordane,;0.0375;8689;278
" More to say ? ";Mordane;time,Tyrion,Lannister,Vardis,;0.5;8698;279
He wiped the blood off his lips with the back of his hand , grinned , and said , " That was a stiff one , Mord . ";Tyrion;Mordane,time,Lannister,Vardis,;-0.107142857143;8704;279
The gaoler squinted at him , trying to decide if he was being mocked . " I could make good use of a strong man like you . ";time;Mordane,Tyrion,Lannister,Vardis,;0.541666666667;8705;279
He took a glancing blow to the shoulder , nothing more . " Gold , " he repeated , scrambling backward like a crab , " more gold than you 'll see here in a lifetime . Enough to buy land , women , horses ... you could be a lord . Lord Mord . ";Tyrion;Mordane,time,Lannister,Vardis,;0.333333333333;8707;279
" Is no gold , " Mord said .;Mordane;time,Tyrion,Lannister,Vardis,;0.0;8709;279
Tyrion thought . " They relieved me of my purse when they captured me , but the gold is still mine . Catelyn Stark might take a man prisoner , but she'd never stoop to rob him . That would n't be honorable . Help me , and all the gold is yours . ";Tyrion;Catelyn,;-0.2;8711;279
Tyrion caught the leather in his hand and held it prisoned . " There will be no risk to you . All you need do is deliver a message . ";Tyrion;Mordane,time,Lannister,Vardis,;0.0;8713;279
The gaoler yanked his leather strap free of Tyrion 's grasp . " Message , " he said , as if he had never heard the word before .;Tyrion;Mordane,time,Lannister,Vardis,;0.4;8714;279
" You heard me , my lord . Only carry my word to your lady . Tell her ... ";Vardis;Mordane,time,Tyrion,Lannister,;0.0;8716;279
The inspiration came to Tyrion Lannister suddenly . " ... tell her that I wish to confess my crimes . ";Lannister;Mordane,time,Tyrion,Vardis,;0.0;8719;279
He wanted that gold , yet he feared a trick ; he had the look of a man who had often been tricked . " Is lie , " he muttered darkly . " Dwarf man cheat me . ";Vardis;Mordane,time,Tyrion,Lannister,;0.0;8722;279
" I will put my promise in writing , " Tyrion vowed .;Tyrion;Mordane,time,Lannister,Vardis,;0.0;8723;279
The turnkey lowered the strap . " Writing down gold . Much gold . ";Vardis;Mordane,time,Tyrion,Lannister,;-0.0277777777778;8726;279
" Oh , much gold , " Tyrion assured him . " The purse is just a taste , my friend . My brother wears armor of solid gold plate . ";Tyrion;Mordane,time,Lannister,Vardis,;0.05;8727;279
When the letter was written , the gaoler frowned at it suspiciously . " Now deliver my message , " Tyrion urged .;Tyrion;Mordane,time,Lannister,Vardis,;0.0;8730;279
Ser Vardis Egen woke Tyrion with the point of his boot . " On your feet , Imp. My lady wants to see you . ";Vardis;Mordane,time,Tyrion,Lannister,;0.2;8733;279
Tyrion rubbed the sleep from his eyes and put on a grimace he scarcely felt . " No doubt she does , but what makes you think I wish to see her ? ";Tyrion;Mordane,time,Lannister,Vardis,;0.0;8734;279
A square , plain face , silver hair , a heavy build , and no humor whatsoever . " Your wishes are not my concern . On your feet , or I 'll have you carried . ";Vardis;Mordane,time,Tyrion,Lannister,;-0.207142857143;8737;279
Tyrion clambered awkwardly to his feet . " A cold night , " he said casually , " and the High Hall is so drafty . I do n't wish to catch a chill . Mord , if you would be so good , fetch my cloak . ";Tyrion;High,;0.07;8738;279
" My cloak , " Tyrion repeated . " The shadowskin you took from me for safekeeping . You recall . ";Tyrion;Mordane,time,Lannister,Vardis,;0.0;8740;279
" Get him the damnable cloak , " Ser Vardis said .;Vardis;Mordane,time,Tyrion,Lannister,;0.0;8741;279
When he draped it around his prisoner 's neck , Tyrion smiled . " My thanks . I shall think of you whenever I wear it . ";Tyrion;Mordane,time,Lannister,Vardis,;0.4;8744;279
He flung the trailing end of the long fur over his right shoulder , and felt warm for the first time in days . " Lead on , Ser Vardis . ";Vardis;Mordane,time,Tyrion,Lannister,;0.271428571429;8745;279
Catelyn Stark spoke first . " You wish to confess your crimes , we are told . ";Catelyn;Tyrion,Arryn,Lysa,Bronn,Mordane,;0.025;8765;280
" I do , my lady , " Tyrion answered .;Tyrion;Catelyn,Arryn,Lysa,Bronn,Mordane,;0.0;8766;280
Lysa Arryn smiled at her sister . " The sky cells always break them . The gods can see them there , and there is no darkness to hide in . ";Arryn;Catelyn,Tyrion,Lysa,Bronn,Mordane,;0.6;8767;280
" He does not look broken to me , " Lady Catelyn said .;Catelyn;Tyrion,Arryn,Lysa,Bronn,Mordane,;-0.4;8768;280
Lady Lysa paid her no mind . " Say what you will , " she commanded Tyrion .;Lysa;Catelyn,Tyrion,Arryn,Bronn,Mordane,;0.0;8769;280
And now to roll the dice , he thought with another quick glance back at Bronn . " Where to begin ? I am a vile little man , I confess it . My crimes and sins are beyond counting , my lords and ladies . I have lain with whores , not once but hundreds of times . I have wished my own lord father dead , and my sister , our gracious queen , as well . ";Bronn;Catelyn,Tyrion,Arryn,Lysa,Mordane,;0.109166666667;8770;280
Behind him , someone chuckled . " I have not always treated my servants with kindness . I have gambled . I have even cheated , I blush to admit . I have said many cruel and malicious things about the noble lords and ladies of the court . ";Tyrion;Catelyn,Arryn,Lysa,Bronn,Mordane,;-0.075;8771;280
That drew outright laughter . " Once I - ";Catelyn;Tyrion,Arryn,Lysa,Bronn,Mordane,;0.0;8772;280
" Silence ! ";Tyrion;Catelyn,Arryn,Lysa,Bronn,Mordane,;0.0;8773;280
Lysa Arryn 's pale round face had turned a burning pink . " What do you imagine you are doing , dwarf ? ";Arryn;Catelyn,Tyrion,Lysa,Bronn,Mordane,;-0.15;8774;280
Tyrion cocked his head to one side . " Why , confessing my crimes , my lady . ";Tyrion;Catelyn,Arryn,Lysa,Bronn,Mordane,;0.0;8775;280
Catelyn Stark took a step forward . " You are accused of sending a hired knife to slay my son Bran in his bed , and of conspiring to murder Lord Jon Arryn , the Hand of the King . ";Catelyn;Bran,;-0.2;8776;280
Tyrion gave a helpless shrug . " Those crimes I cannot confess , I fear . I know nothing of any murders . ";Tyrion;Catelyn,Arryn,Lysa,Bronn,Mordane,;0.0;8777;280
Lady Lysa rose from her weirwood throne . " I will not be made mock of . You have had your little jape , Imp. I trust you enjoyed it . Ser Vardis , take him back to the dungeon ... but this time find him a smaller cell , with a floor more sharply sloped . ";Lysa;Catelyn,Tyrion,Arryn,Bronn,Mordane,;0.235416666667;8778;280
" Is this how justice is done in the Vale ? ";Catelyn;Tyrion,Arryn,Lysa,Bronn,Mordane,;0.0;8779;280
Tyrion roared , so loudly that Ser Vardis froze for an instant . " Does honor stop at the Bloody Gate ? You accuse me of crimes , I deny them , so you throw me into an open cell to freeze and starve . ";Tyrion;Catelyn,Arryn,Lysa,Bronn,Mordane,;-0.266666666667;8780;280
He lifted his head , to give them all a good look at the bruises Mord had left on his face . " Where is the king 's justice ? Is the Eyrie not part of the Seven Kingdoms ? I stand accused , you say . Very well . I demand a trial ! Let me speak , and let my truth or falsehood be judged openly , in the sight of gods and men . ";Mordane;Eyrie,;0.354166666667;8781;280
Her small mouth twitched in a petulant smile . " If you are tried and found to be guilty of the crimes for which you stand accused , then by the king 's own laws , you must pay with your life 's blood . We keep no headsman in the Eyrie , my lord of Lannister . Open the Moon Door . ";Tyrion;Catelyn,Arryn,Lysa,Bronn,Mordane,;0.03;8787;280
" Behold the king 's justice , " Lysa Arryn said .;Arryn;Catelyn,;0.0;8794;281
" Lysa , I think this unwise , " Catelyn Stark said as the black wind swirled around the hall .;Catelyn;Arryn,;-0.183333333333;8796;281
Her sister ignored her . " You want a trial , my lord of Lannister . Very well , a trial you shall have . My son will listen to whatever you care to say , and you shall hear his judgment . Then you may leave ... by one door or the other . ";Arryn;Catelyn,;0.0375;8797;281
" I thank you , my good lady , but I see no need to trouble Lord Robert , " Tyrion said politely . " The gods know the truth of my innocence . I will have their verdict , not the judgment of men . I demand trial by combat . ";Tyrion;Lord,;0.65;8804;282
He had caught her off balance . " You have that right , to be sure . ";Arryn;Tyrion,Lord,Royce,Serrett,Lysa,Vardis,Bronn,;0.392857142857;8810;282
The young knight with the green viper embroidered on his surcoat stepped forward and went to one knee . " My lady , I beg the boon of championing your cause . ";Tyrion;Lord,Royce,Serrett,Lysa,Vardis,Arryn,Bronn,;-0.05;8811;282
" The honor should be mine , " old Lord Hunter said . " For the love I bore your lord husband , let me avenge his death . ";Lord;Tyrion,Royce,Serrett,Lysa,Vardis,Arryn,Bronn,;0.3;8812;282
" My father served Lord Jon faithfully as High Steward of the Vale , " Ser Albar Royce boomed . " Let me serve his son in this . ";Royce;Jon,;0.16;8813;282
" The gods favor the man with the just cause , " said Ser Lyn Corbray , " yet often that turns out to be the man with the surest sword . We all know who that is . ";Serrett;Tyrion,Lord,Royce,Lysa,Vardis,Arryn,Bronn,;0.0;8814;282
Lady Lysa raised a hand for silence . " I thank you , my lords , as I know my son would thank you if he were among us . No men in the Seven Kingdoms are as bold and true as the knights of the Vale . Would that I could grant you all this honor . Yet I can choose only one . ";Lysa;Tyrion,Lord,Royce,Serrett,Vardis,Arryn,Bronn,;0.227777777778;8819;282
She gestured . " Ser Vardis Egen , you were ever my lord husband 's good right hand . You shall be our champion . ";Tyrion;Lord,Royce,Serrett,Lysa,Vardis,Arryn,Bronn,;0.467857142857;8820;282
Ser Vardis had been singularly silent . " My lady , " he said gravely , sinking to one knee , " pray give this burden to another , I have no taste for it . The man is no warrior . Look at him . A dwarf , half my size and lame in the legs . It would be shameful to slaughter such a man and call it justice . ";Vardis;Tyrion,Lord,Royce,Serrett,Lysa,Arryn,Bronn,;-0.166666666667;8821;282
Oh , excellent , Tyrion thought . " I agree . ";Tyrion;Lord,Royce,Serrett,Lysa,Vardis,Arryn,Bronn,;1.0;8822;282
Lysa glared at him . " You demanded a trial by combat . ";Lysa;Tyrion,Lord,Royce,Serrett,Vardis,Arryn,Bronn,;0.0;8823;282
" And now I demand a champion , such as you have chosen for yourself . My brother Jaime will gladly take my part , I know . ";Tyrion;Jaime,;0.0;8824;282
" Your precious Kingslayer is hundreds of leagues from here , " snapped Lysa Arryn .;Arryn;King,;0.5;8825;282
" Send a bird for him . I will gladly await his arrival . ";Tyrion;Lord,Royce,Serrett,Lysa,Vardis,Arryn,Bronn,;0.0;8826;282
" You will face Ser Vardis on the morrow . ";Arryn;Vardis,;0.0;8827;282
" Singer , " Tyrion said , turning to Marillion , " when you make a ballad of this , be certain you tell them how Lady Arryn denied the dwarf the right to a champion , and sent him forth lame and bruised and hobbling to face her finest knight . ";Tyrion;Arryn,;0.0;8828;282
" I deny you nothing ! ";Lysa;Tyrion,Lord,Royce,Serrett,Vardis,Arryn,Bronn,;0.0;8829;282
Lysa Arryn said , her voice peeved and shrill with irritation . " Name your champion , Imp ... if you think you can find a man to die for you . ";Arryn;Tyrion,Lord,Royce,Serrett,Lysa,Vardis,Bronn,;-0.4;8830;282
" If it is all the same to you , I'd sooner find one to kill for me . ";Tyrion;I'd,;0.0;8831;282

" I came down on Storm 's End to lift the siege , " Ned told them , " and the Lords Tyrell and Redwyne dipped their banners , and all their knights bent the knee to pledge us fealty . I was certain you would be among them . ";Ned;Redwyne,;0.0293650793651;8859;283

" No , " Ned said with sadness in his voice . " Now it ends . ";Ned;Gerold,Oswell,Serrett,Arthur,Lyanna,Stark,Jeyne,Robert,Jory,Alyn,;0.0;8872;283
As they came together in a rush of steel and shadow , he could hear Lyanna screaming . " Eddard ! ";Lyanna;Ned,Gerold,Oswell,Serrett,Arthur,Stark,Jeyne,Robert,Jory,Alyn,;0.0;8873;283

" Six days and seven nights . ";Ned;Gerold,Oswell,Serrett,Arthur,Lyanna,Stark,Jeyne,Robert,Jory,Alyn,;0.0;8886;283
The voice was Vayon Poole ' s. The steward held a cup to Ned 's lips . " Drink , my lord . ";Jeyne;Ned,Gerold,Oswell,Serrett,Arthur,Lyanna,Stark,Robert,Jory,Alyn,;0.0;8887;283
" What ... ? ";Ned;Gerold,Oswell,Serrett,Arthur,Lyanna,Stark,Jeyne,Robert,Jory,Alyn,;0.0;8888;283
" Only water . Maester Pycelle said you would be thirsty . ";Gerold;Maester,;0.0;8889;283

Robert was never known for his patience . " Tell him I 'm too weak to come to him . If he wishes to speak with me , I should be pleased to receive him here . I hope you wake him from a sound sleep .

" Poole tells me it has been six days , " Ned said . " I must know how things stand . ";Ned;Jeyne,;0.0;8903;283
" The Kingslayer is fled the city , " Alyn told him . " The talk is he 's ridden back to Casterly Rock to join his father . The story of how Lady Catelyn took the Imp is on every lip . I have put on extra guards , if it please you . ";Alyn;King,Catelyn,Imp,;0.0;8904;283

" You 've done well , Alyn , " Ned was saying when Vayon Poole returned .;Ned;Robert,Cersei,Serrett,eyes,;0.0;8918;284
The steward bowed low . " His Grace is without , my lord , and the queen with him . ";Robert;Grace,;0.0;8919;284
It did not bode well that she had . " Send them in , and leave us . What we have to say should not go beyond these walls . ";Cersei;Ned,Robert,Serrett,eyes,;0.0;8922;284
" Your Grace , " Ned said . " Your pardons . I cannot rise . ";Ned;Robert,Cersei,Serrett,eyes,;0.0;8928;284
" No matter , " the king said gruffly . " Some wine ? From the Arbor . A good vintage . ";Robert;Ned,Cersei,Serrett,eyes,;0.65;8929;284
" A small cup , " Ned said . " My head is still heavy from the milk of the poppy . ";Ned;Robert,Cersei,Serrett,eyes,;-0.225;8930;284
" A man in your place should count himself fortunate that his head is still on his shoulders , " the queen declared .;Cersei;Ned,Robert,Serrett,eyes,;0.4;8931;284
" Quiet , woman , " Robert snapped .;Robert;Ned,Cersei,Serrett,eyes,;0.0;8932;284
He brought Ned a cup of wine . " Does the leg still pain you ? ";Cersei;Ned,Robert,Serrett,eyes,;0.0;8933;284
" Some , " Ned said .;Ned;Robert,Cersei,Serrett,eyes,;0.0;8934;284
" Pycelle swears it will heal clean , " Robert frowned . " I take it you know what Catelyn has done ? ";Robert;Pycelle,Catelyn,;0.366666666667;8936;284
" I do . ";Cersei;Ned,Robert,Serrett,eyes,;0.0;8937;284

" I am not pleased , Ned , " Robert grumbled .;Robert;Ned,Cersei,Serrett,eyes,;0.5;8939;284
" By what right do you dare lay hands on my blood ? ";Ned;Robert,Cersei,Serrett,eyes,;0.285714285714;8940;284
Cersei demanded . " Who do you think you are ? ";Cersei;Ned,Robert,Serrett,eyes,;0.0;8941;284
" The Hand of the King , " Ned told her with icy courtesy . " Charged by your own lord husband to keep the king 's peace and enforce the king 's justice . ";Ned;Robert,Cersei,Serrett,eyes,;0.25;8942;284

" Silence ! ";Robert;Ned,Cersei,Serrett,eyes,;0.0;8944;284
the king roared . " You asked him a question and he answered it . ";Ned;Robert,Cersei,Serrett,eyes,;0.0;8945;284
Cersei subsided , cold with anger , and Robert turned back to Ned . " Keep the king 's peace , you say . Is this how you keep my peace , Ned ? Seven men are dead ... ";Cersei;Ned,Robert,Serrett,eyes,;-0.375;8946;284
" Eight , " the queen corrected . " Tregar died this morning , of the blow Lord Stark gave him . ";Robert;Tregar,;-0.2;8947;284
" Abductions on the kingsroad and drunken slaughter in my streets , " the king said . " I will not have it , Ned . ";Ned;Robert,Cersei,Serrett,eyes,;0.0;8948;284
" Catelyn had good reason for taking the Imp - ";Robert;Catelyn,Imp,;0.65;8949;284
" I said , I will not have it ! To hell with her reasons . You will command her to release the dwarf at once , and you will make your peace with Jaime . ";Ned;Robert,Cersei,Serrett,eyes,;0.0;8950;284
" Three of my men were butchered before my eyes , because Jaime Lannister wished to chasten me . Am I to forget that ? ";Robert;Lannister,;0.0;8951;284
" My brother was not the cause of this quarrel , " Cersei told the king . " Lord Stark was returning drunk from a brothel . His men attacked Jaime and his guards , even as his wife attacked Tyrion on the kingsroad . ";Cersei;Lord,Tyrion,;-0.35;8952;284
" You know me better than that , Robert , " Ned said . " Ask Lord Baelish if you doubt me . He was there . ";Ned;Lord,;0.5;8953;284
" I 've talked to Littlefinger , " Robert said . " He claims he rode off to bring the gold cloaks before the fighting began , but he admits you were returning from some whorehouse . ";Robert;Ned,Cersei,Serrett,eyes,;0.0;8954;284
" Some whorehouse ? Damn your eyes , Robert , I went there to have a look at your daughter ! Her mother has named her Barra . She looks like that first girl you fathered , when we were boys together in the Vale . ";Ned;Barra,;0.25;8955;284
Robert flushed . " Barra , " he grumbled . " Is that supposed to please me ? Damn the girl . I thought she had more sense . ";Robert;Ned,Cersei,Serrett,eyes,;0.5;8957;284
" She cannot be more than fifteen , and a whore , and you thought she had sense ? ";Ned;Robert,Cersei,Serrett,eyes,;0.5;8958;284
It was hard to keep his temper . " The fool child is in love with you , Robert . ";Robert;Ned,Cersei,Serrett,eyes,;0.104166666667;8961;284
The king glanced at Cersei . " This is no fit subject for the queen 's ears . ";Cersei;Ned,Robert,Serrett,eyes,;0.116666666667;8962;284
" Her Grace will have no liking for anything I have to say , " Ned replied . " I am told the Kingslayer has fled the city . Give me leave to bring him back to justice . ";Ned;Grace,King,;0.0;8963;284
He took a swallow . " No , " he said . " I want no more of this . Jaime slew three of your men , and you five of his . Now it ends . ";Robert;Ned,Cersei,Serrett,eyes,;0.5;8965;284
" Is that your notion of justice ? ";Cersei;Ned,Robert,Serrett,eyes,;0.0;8966;284
Ned flared . " If so , I am pleased that I am no longer your Hand . ";Ned;Robert,Cersei,Serrett,eyes,;0.5;8967;284
The queen looked to her husband . " If any man had dared speak to a Targaryen as he has spoken to you - ";Cersei;Ned,Robert,Serrett,eyes,;0.0;8968;284
" Do you take me for Aerys ? ";Robert;Aerys,;0.0;8969;284
" I took you for a king . Jaime and Tyrion are your own brothers , by all the laws of marriage and the bonds we share . The Starks have driven off the one and seized the other . This man dishonors you with every breath he takes , and yet you stand there meekly , asking if his leg pains him and would he like some wine . ";Ned;Jaime,Stark,other,;0.2375;8971;284
Robert 's face was dark with anger . " How many times must I tell you to hold your tongue , woman ? ";Robert;Ned,Cersei,Serrett,eyes,;-0.116666666667;8972;284
Cersei 's face was a study in contempt . " What a jape the gods have made of us two , " she said . " By all rights , you ought to be in skirts and me in mail . ";Cersei;Ned,Robert,Serrett,eyes,;0.0;8973;284
On the morrow the bruise would cover half her face . " I shall wear this as a badge of honor , " she announced .;Ned;Robert,Cersei,Serrett,eyes,;-0.166666666667;8977;284
" Wear it in silence , or I 'll honor you again , " Robert vowed .;Robert;Ned,Cersei,Serrett,eyes,;0.0;8978;284
Ser Meryn Trant stepped into the room , tall and somber in his white armor . " The queen is tired . See her to her bedchamber . ";Serrett;Ned,Robert,Cersei,eyes,;-0.2;8980;284
Robert reached for the flagon and refilled his cup . " You see what she does to me , Ned . ";Robert;Ned,Cersei,Serrett,eyes,;0.0;8982;284
The king seated himself , cradling his wine cup . " My loving wife . The mother of my children . ";Ned;Robert,Cersei,Serrett,eyes,;0.6;8983;284
The rage was gone from him now ; in his eyes Ned saw something sad and scared . " I should not have hit her . That was not ... that was not kingly . ";eyes;Ned,Robert,Cersei,Serrett,;-0.5;8984;284
He stared down at his hands , as if he did not quite know what they were . " I was always strong ... no one could stand before me , no one . How do you fight someone if you ca n't hit them ? ";Robert;Ned,Cersei,Serrett,eyes,;0.138888888889;8985;284
Confused , the king shook his head . " Rhaegar ... Rhaegar won , damn him . I killed him , Ned , I drove the spike right through that black armor into his black heart , and he died at my feet . They made up songs about it . Yet somehow he still won . He has Lyanna now , and I have her . ";Cersei;Rhaegar,Lyanna,;-0.111904761905;8986;284
" Your Grace , " Ned Stark said , " we must talk ... ";Ned;Robert,Cersei,Serrett,eyes,;-0.2;8988;284
Robert pressed his fingertips against his temples . " I am sick unto death of talk . On the morrow I 'm going to the kingswood to hunt . Whatever you have to say can wait until I return . ";Robert;Ned,Cersei,Serrett,eyes,;-0.714285714286;8989;284
" If the gods are good , I shall not be here on your return . You commanded me to return to Winterfell , remember ? ";Ned;Robert,Cersei,Serrett,eyes,;0.65;8990;284
Robert stood up , grasping one of the bedposts to steady himself . " The gods are seldom good , Ned . Here , this is yours . ";Robert;Ned,Cersei,Serrett,eyes,;0.408333333333;8991;284
He pulled the heavy silver hand clasp from a pocket in the lining of his cloak and tossed it on the bed . " Like it or not , you are my Hand , damn you . I forbid you to leave . ";Cersei;Ned,Robert,Serrett,eyes,;-0.2;8992;284
His leg throbbed , and he felt as helpless as a child . " The Targaryen girl - ";Ned;Robert,Cersei,Serrett,eyes,;0.0;8995;284
The king groaned . " Seven hells , do n't start with her again . That 's done , I 'll hear no more of it . ";Robert;Ned,Cersei,Serrett,eyes,;0.5;8996;284
" Why would you want me as your Hand , if you refuse to listen to my counsel ? ";Ned;Robert,Cersei,Serrett,eyes,;0.0;8997;284
" Why ? ";Cersei;Ned,Robert,Serrett,eyes,;0.0;8998;284
Robert laughed . " Why not ? Someone has to rule this damnable kingdom . Put on the badge , Ned . It suits you . And if you ever throw it in my face again , I swear to you , I 'll pin the damned thing on Jaime Lannister . ";Robert;Ned,Cersei,Serrett,eyes,;0.7;8999;284
Catelyn wondered how large a waterfall her own tears would make when she died . " Tell me the rest of it , " she said .;Catelyn;Serrett,Rodrik,;0.407142857143;9011;285
" The Kingslayer is massing a host at Casterly Rock , " Ser Rodrik Cassel answered from the room behind her . " Your brother writes that he has sent riders to the Rock , demanding that Lord Tywin proclaim his intent , but he has had no answer .

";Serrett;King,Lord,Edmure,;0.05;9012;285
Its beauty did little to lighten her mood ; it seemed cruel for a day to dawn so fair and end so foul as this one promised to . " Edmure has sent riders and made vows , " she said , " but Edmure is not the Lord of Riverrun . What of my lord father ? ";Catelyn;Edmure,;-0.1625;9014;285
" The message made no mention of Lord Hoster , my lady . ";Rodrik;Catelyn,Serrett,;0.0;9015;285

" Then she still plans to go through with this mummer 's farce ? ";Serrett;Catelyn,Rodrik,;0.0;9022;285
Catelyn grimaced . " The dwarf has played her like a set of pipes , and she is too deaf to hear the tune . Whatever happens this morning , Ser Rodrik , it is past time we took our leave . My place is at Winterfell with my sons . If you are strong enough to travel , I shall ask Lysa for an escort to see us to Gulltown . We can take ship from there .

" Another ship ? ";Serrett;Catelyn,Rodrik,;0.0;9024;285
Ser Rodrik looked a shade green , yet he managed not to shudder . " As you say , my lady . ";Rodrik;Catelyn,Serrett,;-0.2;9025;285
" Lannister is my prisoner , " she told Ser Rodrik as they descended the tower stairs and made their way through the Eyrie 's cold white halls .;Rodrik;Lannister,;-0.3;9032;286
Catelyn wore plain grey wool with a silvered belt . " My sister must be reminded of that . ";Catelyn;Rodrik,Lysa,Brynden,;-0.132142857143;9033;286
At the doors to Lysa 's apartments , they met her uncle storming out . " Going to join the fool 's festival ? ";Lysa;Rodrik,Catelyn,Brynden,;0.0;9034;286
Ser Brynden snapped . " I'd tell you to slap some sense into your sister , if I thought it would do any good , but you'd only bruise your hand . ";Brynden;I'd,;0.325;9035;286
" There was a bird from Riverrun , " Catelyn began , " a letter from Edmure ... ";Catelyn;Rodrik,Lysa,Brynden,;0.0;9036;286
" I know , child . ";Rodrik;Catelyn,Lysa,Brynden,;0.0;9037;286
The black fish that fastened his cloak was Brynden 's only concession to ornament . " I had to hear it from Maester Colemon . I asked your sister for leave to take a thousand seasoned men and ride for Riverrun with all haste . Do you know what she told me ? The Vale cannot spare a thousand swords , nor even one , Uncle , she said . You are the Knight of the Gate . Your place is here . ";Brynden;Vale,Maester,Knight,;0.0277777777778;9038;286
A gust of childish laughter drifted through the open doors behind him , and her uncle glanced darkly over his shoulder . " Well , I told her she could bloody well find herself a new Knight of the Gate . Black fish or no , I am still a Tully . I shall leave for Riverrun by evenfall . ";Rodrik;Knight,;-0.238383838384;9039;286
Catelyn could not pretend to surprise . " Alone ? You know as well as I that you will never survive the high road . Ser Rodrik and I are returning to Winterfell . Come with us , Uncle . I will give you your thousand men . Riverrun will not fight alone . ";Catelyn;Riverrun,;0.16;9040;286
Brynden thought a moment , then nodded a brusque agreement . " As you say . It 's the long way home , but I 'm more like to get there . I 'll wait for you below . ";Brynden;Rodrik,Catelyn,Lysa,;0.225;9041;286
When Lysa espied Catelyn , she welcomed her with a sisterly embrace and a moist kiss on the cheek . " Is n't it a lovely morning ? The gods are smiling on us . Do try a cup of the wine , sweet sister . Lord Hunter was kind enough to send for it , from his own cellars . ";Lysa;Lord,;0.41;9062;287
" Thank you , no . Lysa , we must talk . ";Catelyn;Lysa,Lord,Waynwood,Serrett,Rodrik,Maester,;0.0;9063;287
" After , " her sister promised , already beginning to turn away from her .;Lysa;Catelyn,Lord,Waynwood,Serrett,Rodrik,Maester,;0.0;9064;287
" Now . ";Catelyn;Lysa,Lord,Waynwood,Serrett,Rodrik,Maester,;0.0;9065;287
Men were turning to look . " Lysa , you cannot mean to go ahead with this folly . Alive , the Imp has value . Dead , he is only food for crows . And if his champion should prevail here - ";Lysa;Imp,;-0.103125;9067;287
" Small chance of that , my lady , " Lord Hunter assured her , patting her shoulder with a liver-spotted hand . " Ser Vardis is a doughty fighter . He will make short work of the sellsword . ";Lord;Vardis,;-0.125;9068;287
" Will he , my lord ? ";Lysa;Catelyn,Lord,Waynwood,Serrett,Rodrik,Maester,;0.0;9069;287
Catelyn said coolly . " I wonder . ";Catelyn;Lysa,Lord,Waynwood,Serrett,Rodrik,Maester,;0.0;9070;287
Lysa 's suitors were gathering around them like bees round a blossom . " Women understand little of these things , " Ser Morton Waynwood said . " Ser Vardis is a knight , sweet lady . This other fellow , well , his sort are all cowards at heart . Useful enough in a battle , with thousands of their fellows around them , but stand them up alone and the manhood leaks right out of them . ";Waynwood;Women,Vardis,;0.0604591836735;9073;287
" Say you have the truth of it , then , " Catelyn said with a courtesy that made her mouth ache . " What will we gain by the dwarf 's death ? Do you imagine that Jaime will care a fig that we gave his brother a trial before we flung him off a mountain ? ";Catelyn;Jaime,;0.0;9074;287
" Behead the man , " Ser Lyn Corbray suggested . " When the Kingslayer receives the Imp 's head , it will be a warning to him . ";Serrett;King,Imp,;0.0;9075;287
Lysa gave an impatient shake of her waist-long auburn hair . " Lord Robert wants to see him fly , " she said , as if that settled the matter . " And the Imp has only himself to blame . It was he who demanded a trial by combat . ";Lysa;Lord,Imp,;0.2;9076;287
" Lady Lysa had no honorable way to deny him , even if she'd wished to , " Lord Hunter intoned ponderously .;Lord;Lysa,;0.0;9077;287
Ignoring them all , Catelyn turned all her force on her sister . " I remind you , Tyrion Lannister is my prisoner . ";Catelyn;Tyrion,;0.0;9078;287
" And I remind you , the dwarf murdered my lord husband ! ";Lord;Lysa,Catelyn,Waynwood,Serrett,Rodrik,Maester,;0.0;9079;287
Her voice rose . " He poisoned the Hand of the King and left my sweet baby fatherless , and now I mean to see him pay ! ";Lysa;Catelyn,Lord,Waynwood,Serrett,Rodrik,Maester,;0.16171875;9080;287
" Do you think he did ? ";Catelyn;Lysa,Lord,Waynwood,Serrett,Rodrik,Maester,;0.0;9083;287
Ser Rodrik asked her quietly when they were alone again . " Murder Lord Jon , that is ? The Imp still denies it , and most fiercely ... ";Rodrik;Imp,;0.5;9084;287
" I believe the Lannisters murdered Lord Arryn , " Catelyn replied , " but whether it was Tyrion , or Ser Jaime , or the queen , or all of them together , I could not begin to say . ";Catelyn;Lannister,Lord,Tyrion,;0.0;9085;287
Ser Rodrik tugged at his whiskers . " Poison , well ... that could be the dwarf 's work , true enough . Or Cersei ' s. It 's said poison is a woman 's weapon , begging your pardons , my lady . The Kingslayer , now ... I have no great liking for the man , but he 's not the sort . Too fond of the sight of blood on that golden sword of his . Was it poison , my lady ? ";Rodrik;Lysa,Catelyn,Lord,Waynwood,Serrett,Maester,;0.3625;9089;287
Catelyn frowned , vaguely uneasy . " How else could they make it look a natural death ? ";Catelyn;Lysa,Lord,Waynwood,Serrett,Rodrik,Maester,;0.1;9090;287
She glanced at her nephew and sighed . " The boy is utterly without discipline . He will never be strong enough to rule unless he is taken away from his mother for a time . ";Lysa;Catelyn,Lord,Waynwood,Serrett,Rodrik,Maester,;0.216666666667;9092;287
" His lord father agreed with you , " said a voice at her elbow .;Catelyn;Lysa,Lord,Waynwood,Serrett,Rodrik,Maester,;0.0;9093;287
She turned to behold Maester Colemon , a cup of wine in his hand . " He was planning to send the boy to Dragonstone for fostering , you know ... oh , but I 'm speaking out of turn . ";Maester;Lysa,Catelyn,Lord,Waynwood,Serrett,Rodrik,;0.0;9094;287
The apple of his throat bobbed anxiously beneath the loose maester 's chain . " I fear I 've had too much of Lord Hunter 's excellent wine . The prospect of bloodshed has my nerves all a-fray ... ";Lysa;Catelyn,Lord,Waynwood,Serrett,Rodrik,Maester,;0.341025641026;9095;287
" You are mistaken , Maester , " Catelyn said . " It was Casterly Rock , not Dragonstone , and those arrangements were made after the Hand 's death , without my sister 's consent . ";Catelyn;Rock,;0.0;9096;287
The maester 's head jerked so vigorously at the end of his absurdly long neck that he looked half a puppet himself . " No , begging your forgiveness , my lady , but it was Lord Jon who - ";Lysa;Jon,;-0.108333333333;9097;287
" The bad little man , " Lord Robert said , giggling . " Mother , can I make him fly ? I want to see him fly . ";Lord;Lysa,Catelyn,Waynwood,Serrett,Rodrik,Maester,;0.198958333333;9102;287
" Later , my sweet baby , " Lysa promised him .;Lysa;Catelyn,Lord,Waynwood,Serrett,Rodrik,Maester,;0.175;9103;287
" Trial first , " drawled Ser Lyn Corbray , " then execution . ";Serrett;Lysa,Catelyn,Lord,Waynwood,Rodrik,Maester,;0.25;9104;287
Robert Arryn , Lord of the Eyrie and Defender of the Vale , was fidgeting impatiently in his elevated chair . " When are they going to fight ? ";Robert;;0.0;9125;288
The blade was engraved with a delicate silver tracery of a mountain sky ; its pommel was a falcon 's head , its crossguard fashioned into the shape of wings . " I had that sword crafted for Jon in King 's Landing , " Lysa told her guests proudly as they watched Ser Vardis try a practice cut . " He wore it whenever he sat the Iron Throne in King Robert 's place . Is n't it a lovely thing ? I thought it only fitting that our champion avenge Jon with his own blade . ";Lysa;Vardis,;0.26;9133;289
" Make them fight ! ";Lysa;Vardis,;0.0;9136;289
Ser Vardis faced the Lord of the Eyrie and lifted his sword in salute . " For the Eyrie and the Vale ! ";Vardis;Lysa,;0.0;9138;289
" They await your command , " Lady Lysa said to her lord son .;Lysa;Vardis,;0.0;9141;289
" Fight ! ";Lysa;Vardis,;0.0;9142;289
" The man is craven , " Lord Hunter declared . " Stand and fight , coward ! ";Lord;;0.0;9159;290
Her master-at-arms gave a curt shake of his head . " He wants to make Ser Vardis chase him . The weight of armor and shield will tire even the strongest man . ";Lord;;0.2;9162;290
As she pressed it into his hand , she pleaded with him . " He is only a foolish boy , but I have loved him like a brother . It would grieve me to see him die . ";Bran;;0.35;9169;291
Brandon was a man grown , and he drove Littlefinger all the way across the bailey and down the water stair , raining steel on him with every step , until the boy was staggering and bleeding from a dozen wounds . " Yield ! ";Bran;;-0.194444444444;9172;291
He looked at her as he fell and murmured " Cat " as the bright blood came flowing out between his mailed fingers .;Bran;;0.7;9175;291
" They 're not fighting good , Mother , " the Lord of the Eyrie complained . " I want them to fight . ";Eyrie;;0.175;9190;292
" They will , sweet baby , " his mother soothed him . " The sellsword ca n't run all day . ";Eyrie;;0.35;9191;292
" Behind you , ser ! ";Lord;;-0.5;9204;293
" Ser Vardis is hurt , " Ser Rodrik said , his voice grave .;Rodrik;Vardis,;0.0;9211;294
Blind with arrogance as they were , even the knights and lords of the Vale could see what was happening below them , yet her sister could not . " Enough , Ser Vardis ! ";Vale;Lysa,;-0.3125;9220;295
Lady Lysa called down . " Finish him now , my baby is growing tired . ";Lysa;Vale,;-0.277777777778;9221;295
" Is it over , Mother ? ";Tyrion;Lysa,Imp,Eyrie,Arryn,;0.0;9243;296
" Yes , " Lysa said glumly , her voice as cold and dead as the captain of her guard .;Lysa;Tyrion,Imp,Eyrie,Arryn,;-0.4;9246;296
" Can I make the little man fly now ? ";Imp;Lysa,Tyrion,Eyrie,Arryn,;0.30625;9247;296
Across the garden , Tyrion Lannister got to his feet . " Not this little man , " he said . " This little man is going down in the turnip hoist , thank you very much . ";Tyrion;Lysa,Imp,Eyrie,Arryn,;-0.0461111111111;9248;296
" You presume - " Lysa began .;Lysa;Tyrion,Imp,Eyrie,Arryn,;0.0;9249;296
" I presume that House Arryn remembers its own words , " the Imp said . " As High as Honor . ";Imp;Arryn,;0.38;9250;296
" You promised I could make him fly , " the Lord of the Eyrie screamed at his mother .;Eyrie;Lysa,Tyrion,Imp,Arryn,;0.8;9251;296
Lady Lysa 's face was flushed with fury . " The gods have seen fit to proclaim him innocent , child . We have no choice but to free him . ";Lysa;Tyrion,Imp,Eyrie,Arryn,;0.433333333333;9253;296
She lifted her voice . " Guards . Take my lord of Lannister and his ... creature here out of my sight . Escort them to the Bloody Gate and set them free . See that they have horses and supplies sufficient to reach the Trident , and make certain all their goods and weapons are returned to them . They shall need them on the high road . ";Imp;Trident,;-0.00642857142857;9254;296
" The high road , " Tyrion Lannister said .;Tyrion;Lysa,Imp,Eyrie,Arryn,;0.16;9255;296
Yet the dwarf favored Lady Arryn with a mocking bow . " As you command , my lady , " he said . " I believe we know the way . ";Arryn;Lysa,Tyrion,Imp,Eyrie,;0.8;9259;296
" You are as hopeless as any boys I have ever trained , " Ser Alliser Thorne announced when they had all assembled in the yard . " Your hands were made for manure shovels , not for swords , and if it were up to me , the lot of you would be set to herding swine . But last night I was told that Gueren is marching five new boys up the kingsroad . One or two may even be worth the price of piss . To make room for them , I have decided to pass eight of you on to the Lord Commander to do with as he will . ";Alliser;Gueren,;0.145454545455;9263;297
He called out the names one by one . " Toad . Stone Head . Aurochs . Lover . Pimple . Monkey . Ser Loon . ";Halder;Alliser,Jon,Sam,;0.0;9264;297
Last , he looked at Jon . " And the Bastard . ";Jon;Alliser,Halder,Sam,;0.0;9265;297
Ser Alliser fixed him with a reptile stare . " They will call you men of Night 's Watch now , but you are bigger fools than the Mummer 's Monkey here if you believe that . You are boys still , green and stinking of summer , and when the winter comes you will die like flies . ";Alliser;Jon,Halder,Sam,;-0.0333333333333;9267;297
Halder smacked Toad on the butt with the flat of his sword and shouted , " Toad , of the Night 's Watch ! ";Halder;Alliser,Jon,Sam,;-0.03125;9270;297
Jon offered him the skin . " A swallow of wine ? ";Jon;Alliser,Halder,Sam,;0.0;9274;297
Sam shook his head . " No thank you , Jon . ";Sam;Alliser,Jon,Halder,;0.0;9275;297
" Are you well ? ";Jon;Alliser,Halder,Sam,;0.0;9276;297
" Very well , truly , " the fat boy lied . " I am so happy for you all . ";Alliser;Jon,Halder,Sam,;0.5;9277;297
His round face quivered as he forced a smile . " You will be First Ranger someday , just as your uncle was . ";Halder;Ranger,;0.0125;9278;297
" Is , " Jon corrected .;Jon;Alliser,Halder,Sam,;0.0;9279;297
Before he could say more , Halder cried , " Here , you planning to drink that all yourself ? ";Halder;Alliser,Jon,Sam,;0.5;9281;297
The eight soon-to-be brothers feasted on rack of lamb baked in a crust of garlic and herbs , garnished with sprigs of mint , and surrounded by mashed yellow turnips swimming in butter . " From the Lord Commander 's own table , " Bowen Marsh told them .;Marsh;Pyp,Grenn,Matthar,Halder,Dareon,Jon,Bran,;0.3;9291;298
" Do you think they 'll keep us together ? ";Pyp;Marsh,Grenn,Matthar,Halder,Dareon,Jon,Bran,;0.0;9293;298
Toad made a face . " I hope not . I 'm sick of looking at those ears of yours . ";Jon;Marsh,Pyp,Grenn,Matthar,Halder,Dareon,Bran,;-0.714285714286;9295;298
" Ho , " said Pyp . " Listen to the crow call the raven black . You 're certain to be a ranger , Toad . They 'll want you as far from the castle as they can . If Mance Rayder attacks , lift your visor and show your face , and he 'll run off screaming . ";Pyp;Marsh,Grenn,Matthar,Halder,Dareon,Jon,Bran,;0.0492063492063;9296;298
Everyone laughed but Grenn . " I hope I 'm a ranger . ";Grenn;Marsh,Pyp,Matthar,Halder,Dareon,Jon,Bran,;0.7;9297;298
" You and everyone else , " said Matthar .;Matthar;Marsh,Pyp,Grenn,Halder,Dareon,Jon,Bran,;0.0;9298;298
" Not everyone , " said Halder . " It 's the builders for me . What use would rangers be if the Wall fell down ? ";Halder;King,;-0.155555555556;9301;298
" The Old Bear 's no fool , " Dareon observed . " You 're certain to be a builder , and Jon 's certain to be a ranger . He 's the best sword and the best rider among us , and his uncle was the First before he ... ";Dareon;Old,First,;0.463095238095;9305;298
" Benjen Stark is still First Ranger , " Jon Snow told him , toying with his bowl of blueberries .;Jon;Stark,;0.025;9307;298
" Are n't you going to eat those ? ";Pyp;Marsh,Grenn,Matthar,Halder,Dareon,Jon,Bran,;0.0;9310;298
" They 're yours . ";Dareon;Marsh,Pyp,Grenn,Matthar,Halder,Jon,Bran,;0.0;9312;298
Jon had hardly tasted Hobb 's great feast . " I could not eat another bite . ";Jon;Marsh,Pyp,Grenn,Matthar,Halder,Dareon,Bran,;0.8;9313;298
Pyp followed him . " Jon , what is it ? ";Pyp;Marsh,Grenn,Matthar,Halder,Dareon,Jon,Bran,;0.0;9315;298
" Sam , " he admitted . " He was not at table tonight . ";Jon;Marsh,Pyp,Grenn,Matthar,Halder,Dareon,Bran,;0.0;9316;298
" It 's not like him to miss a meal , " Pyp said thoughtfully . " Do you suppose he 's taken ill ? ";Pyp;Marsh,Grenn,Matthar,Halder,Dareon,Jon,Bran,;-0.5;9317;298
" He 's frightened . We 're leaving him . ";Jon;Marsh,Pyp,Grenn,Matthar,Halder,Dareon,Bran,;0.0;9318;298
He remembered the day he had left Winterfell , all the bittersweet farewells ; Bran lying broken , Robb with snow in his hair , Arya raining kisses on him after he'd given her Needle . " Once we say our words , we 'll all have duties to attend to . Some of us may be sent away , to Eastwatch or the Shadow Tower . Sam will remain in training , with the likes of Rast and Cuger and these new boys who are coming up the kingsroad . Gods only know what they 'll be like , but you can bet Ser Alliser will send them against him , first chance he gets . ";Bran;Sam,Alliser,;-0.00272727272727;9319;298
Pyp made a grimace . " You did all you could . ";Pyp;Marsh,Grenn,Matthar,Halder,Dareon,Jon,Bran,;0.0;9320;298
" All we could was n't enough , " Jon said .;Jon;Marsh,Pyp,Grenn,Matthar,Halder,Dareon,Bran,;0.0;9321;298
Once he swore his vow , the Wall would be his home until he was old as Maester Aemon . " I have not sworn yet , " he muttered .;King;;0.1;9337;299
It was Chett who answered Jon 's knock . " I need to speak to Maester Aemon , " Jon told him .;Jon;Chett,Maester,;0.0;9364;300
" The maester is abed , as you should be . Come back on the morrow and maybe he 'll see you . ";Chett;Jon,Maester,;0.0;9365;300
Jon jammed it open with his boot . " I need to speak to him now . The morning will be too late . ";Jon;Chett,Maester,;-0.133333333333;9367;300
Chett scowled . " The maester is not accustomed to being woken in the night . Do you know how old he is ? ";Chett;Jon,Maester,;0.1;9368;300
" Old enough to treat visitors with more courtesy than you , " Jon said . " Give him my pardons . I would not disturb his rest if it were not important . ";Jon;Chett,Maester,;0.25;9369;300
" And if I refuse ? ";Chett;Jon,Maester,;0.0;9370;300
Jon had his boot wedged solidly in the door . " I can stand here all night if I must . ";Jon;Chett,Maester,;0.0;9371;300
The black brother made a disgusted noise and opened the door to admit him . " Wait in the library . There 's wood . Start a fire . I wo n't have the maester catching a chill on account of you . ";Chett;Jon,Maester,;-0.188888888889;9372;300
A maester did not remove it even to sleep . " The chair beside the fire would be pleasant , " he said when he felt the warmth on his face .;Maester;Jon,Chett,;0.733333333333;9375;300
" I am sorry to have woken you , Maester , " Jon Snow said .;Jon;Chett,Maester,;-0.5;9377;300
" You did not wake me , " Maester Aemon replied . " I find I need less sleep as I grow older , and I am grown very old . I often spend half the night with ghosts , remembering times fifty years past as if they were yesterday . The mystery of a midnight visitor is a welcome diversion . So tell me , Jon Snow , why have you come calling at this strange hour ? ";Maester;Jon,Chett,;0.0661904761905;9378;300
" To ask that Samwell Tarly be taken from training and accepted as a brother of the Night 's Watch . ";Jon;Sam,;0.0;9379;300
" This is no concern of Maester Aemon , " Chett complained .;Chett;Jon,Maester,;-0.3;9380;300
" Our Lord Commander has given the training of recruits into the hands of Ser Alliser Thorne , " the maester said gently . " Only he may say when a boy is ready to swear his vow , as you surely know . Why then come to me ? ";Maester;Commander,;0.1;9381;300
" The Lord Commander listens to you , " Jon told him . " And the wounded and the sick of the Night 's Watch are in your charge . ";Jon;Lord,;-0.714285714286;9382;300
" And is your friend Samwell wounded or sick ? ";Chett;Sam,;-0.714285714286;9383;300
" He will be , " Jon promised , " unless you help . ";Jon;Chett,Maester,;0.0;9384;300
Maester Aemon listened silently , blind eyes fixed on the fire , but Chett 's face darkened with each word . " Without us to keep him safe , Sam will have no chance , " Jon finished . " He 's hopeless with a sword . My sister Arya could tear him apart , and she 's not yet ten . If Ser Alliser makes him fight , it 's only a matter of time before he 's hurt or killed . ";Jon;Sam,sister,Alliser,;0.02;9386;300
Chett could stand no more . " I 've seen this fat boy in the common hall , " he said . " He is a pig , and a hopeless craven as well , if what you say is true . ";Chett;Jon,Maester,;0.183333333333;9387;300
" Maybe it is so , " Maester Aemon said . " Tell me , Chett , what would you have us do with such a boy ? ";Maester;Jon,Chett,;0.0;9388;300
" Leave him where he is , " Chett said . " The Wall is no place for the weak . Let him train until he is ready , no matter how many years that takes . Ser Alliser shall make a man of him or kill him , as the gods will . ";Chett;King,Alliser,;0.108333333333;9389;300
" That 's stupid , " Jon said .;Jon;Chett,Maester,;-0.8;9390;300
He took a deep breath to gather his thoughts . " I remember once I asked Maester Luwin why he wore a chain around his throat . ";Chett;Maester,;0.0;9391;300
Maester Aemon touched his own collar lightly , his bony , wrinkled finger stroking the heavy metal links . " Go on . ";Maester;Jon,Chett,;0.2;9392;300
" He told me that a maester 's collar is made of chain to remind him that he is sworn to serve , " Jon said , remembering . " I asked why each link was a different metal . A silver chain would look much finer with his grey robes , I said . Maester Luwin laughed . A maester forges his chain with study , he told me . The different metals are each a different kind of learning , gold for the study of money and accounts , silver for healing , iron for warcraft . And he said there were other meanings as well . The collar is supposed to remind a maester of the realm he serves , is n't that so ? Lords are gold and knights steel , but two links ca n't make a chain . You also need silver and iron and lead , tin and copper and bronze and all the rest , and those are farmers and smiths and merchants and the like . A chain needs all sorts of metals , and a land needs all sorts of people . ";Jon;Maester,;0.153125;9393;300
Maester Aemon smiled . " And so ? ";Maester;Jon,Chett,;0.6;9394;300
" The Night 's Watch needs all sorts too . Why else have rangers and stewards and builders ? Lord Randyll could n't make Sam a warrior , and Ser Alliser wo n't either . You ca n't hammer tin into iron , no matter how hard you beat it , but that does n't mean tin is useless . Why should n't Sam be a steward ? ";Jon;Lord,Sam,;-0.368055555556;9395;300
Chett gave an angry scowl . " I 'm a steward . You think it 's easy work , fit for cowards ? The order of stewards keeps the Watch alive . We hunt and farm , tend the horses , milk the cows , gather firewood , cook the meals . Who do you think makes your clothing ? Who brings up supplies from the south ? The stewards . ";Chett;Jon,Maester,;0.108333333333;9396;300
Maester Aemon was gentler . " Is your friend a hunter ? ";Maester;Jon,Chett,;0.0;9397;300
" He hates hunting , " Jon had to admit .;Jon;Chett,Maester,;0.0;9398;300
" Can he plow a field ? ";Chett;Jon,Maester,;0.0;9399;300
the maester asked . " Can he drive a wagon or sail a ship ? Could he butcher a cow ? ";Jon;Chett,Maester,;0.0;9400;300
" No . ";Maester;Jon,Chett,;0.0;9401;300
Chett gave a nasty laugh . " I 've seen what happens to soft lordlings when they 're put to work . Set them to churning butter and their hands blister and bleed . Give them an axe to split logs , and they cut off their own foot . ";Chett;Jon,Maester,;-0.1;9402;300
" I know one thing Sam could do better than anyone . ";Jon;Sam,;0.5;9403;300
" Yes ? ";Chett;Jon,Maester,;0.0;9404;300
Jon glanced warily at Chett , standing beside the door , his boils red and angry . " He could help you , " he said quickly . " He can do sums , and he knows how to read and write . I know Chett ca n't read , and Clydas has weak eyes . Sam read every book in his father 's library . He'd be good with the ravens too . Animals seem to like him . Ghost took to him straight off . There 's a lot he could do , besides fighting . The Night 's Watch needs every man . Why kill one , to no end ? Make use of him instead . ";Jon;Chett,Sam,;-0.005;9406;300
Finally he said , " Maester Luwin taught you well , Jon Snow . Your mind is as deft as your blade , it would seem . ";Chett;Maester,;0.6;9408;300
" Does that mean ... ? ";Jon;Chett,Maester,;-0.3125;9409;300
" It means I shall think on what you have said , " the maester told him firmly . " And now , I believe I am ready to sleep . Chett , show our young brother to the door . ";Chett;Jon,Maester,;0.15;9410;300
He stooped to pick up a splintered branch and examined it critically . " Will this do ? I am not practiced at starting fires . Morrec did that for me . ";Tyrion;Morrec,;0.0;9416;301
" A fire ? ";Mordane;Tyrion,Bronn,;0.0;9417;301
Bronn said , spitting . " Are you so hungry to die , dwarf ? Or have you taken leave of your senses ? A fire will bring the clansmen down on us from miles around . I mean to survive this journey , Lannister . ";Bronn;Tyrion,Mordane,;-0.234027777778;9418;301
" And how do you hope to do that ? ";Tyrion;Bronn,Mordane,;0.0;9419;301
" We have no chance of fighting our way back , " Bronn said , " but two can cover more ground than ten , and attract less notice . The fewer days we spend in these mountains , the more like we are to reach the riverlands . Ride hard and fast , I say . Travel by night and hole up by day , avoid the road where we can , make no noise and light no fires . ";Bronn;Tyrion,Mordane,;0.142708333333;9423;301
Tyrion Lannister sighed . " A splendid plan , Bronn . Try it , as you like ... and forgive me if I do not linger to bury you . ";Tyrion;Bronn,Mordane,;0.833333333333;9424;301
" You think to outlive me , dwarf ? ";Bronn;Tyrion,Mordane,;0.0;9425;301
Tyrion shrugged . " Riding hard and fast by night is a sure way to tumble down a mountain and crack your skull . I prefer to make my crossing slow and easy . I know you love the taste of horse , Bronn , but if our mounts die under us this time , we 'll be trying to saddle shadowcats ... and if truth be told , I think the clans will find us no matter what we do . Their eyes are all around us . ";Tyrion;Bronn,Mordane,;0.126587301587;9428;301
Bronn grimaced . " Then we 're dead men , Lannister . ";Bronn;Tyrion,Mordane,;-0.2;9430;301
" If so , I prefer to die comfortable , " Tyrion replied . " We need a fire . The nights are cold up here , and hot food will warm our bellies and lift our spirits . Do you suppose there 's any game to be had ? Lady Lysa has kindly provided us with a veritable feast of salt beef , hard cheese , and stale bread , but I would hate to break a tooth so far from the nearest maester . ";Tyrion;Lysa,;-0.137962962963;9431;301
" I can find meat . ";Mordane;Tyrion,Bronn,;0.0;9432;301
Beneath a fall of black hair , Bronn 's dark eyes regarded Tyrion suspiciously . " I should leave you here with your fool 's fire . If I took your horse , I'd have twice the chance to make it through . What would you do then , dwarf ? ";Bronn;I'd,;-0.158333333333;9433;301
" Die , most like . ";Mordane;Tyrion,Bronn,;0.5;9434;301
" You do n't think I'd do it ? ";Tyrion;I'd,;0.0;9436;301
" You'd do it in an instant , if it meant your life . You were quick enough to silence your friend Chiggen when he caught that arrow in his belly . ";Mordane;You'd,Chiggen,;0.111111111111;9437;301
" He was good as dead , " Bronn said , " and his moaning was bringing them down on us . Chiggen would have done the same for me ... and he was no friend , only a man I rode with . Make no mistake , dwarf . I fought for you , but I do not love you . ";Bronn;Chiggen,;0.132407407407;9439;301
" It was your blade I needed , " Tyrion said , " not your love . ";Tyrion;Bronn,Mordane,;0.5;9440;301
Bronn grinned . " You 're bold as any sellsword , I 'll give you that . How did you know I'd take your part ? ";Bronn;I'd,;0.333333333333;9442;301
" Know ? ";Mordane;Tyrion,Bronn,;0.0;9443;301
Tyrion squatted awkwardly on his stunted legs to build the fire . " I tossed the dice . Back at the inn , you and Chiggen helped take me captive . Why ? The others saw it as their duty , for the honor of the lords they served , but not you two . You had no lord , no duty , and precious little honor , so why trouble to involve yourselves ? ";Tyrion;Chiggen,;0.128125;9444;301
He took out his knife and whittled some thin strips of bark off one of the sticks he'd gathered , to serve as kindling . " Well , why do sellswords do anything ? For gold . You were thinking Lady Catelyn would reward you for your help , perhaps even take you into her service . Here , that should do , I hope . Do you have a flint ? ";Bronn;Catelyn,;-0.4;9445;301
" My thanks , " he said . " The thing is , you did not know the Starks . Lord Eddard is a proud , honorable , and honest man , and his lady wife is worse . Oh , no doubt she would have found a coin or two for you when this was all over , and pressed it in your hand with a polite word and a look of distaste , but that 's the most you could have hoped for . The Starks look for courage and loyalty and honor in the men they choose to serve them , and if truth be told , you and Chiggen were lowborn scum . ";Tyrion;Lord,Chiggen,;0.34;9448;301
Bronn snorted . " You have a bold tongue , little man . One day someone is like to cut it out and make you eat it . ";Bronn;Tyrion,Mordane,;0.0729166666667;9451;301
" Everyone tells me that . ";Mordane;Tyrion,Bronn,;0.0;9452;301
Tyrion glanced up at the sellsword . " Did I offend you ? My pardons ... but you are scum , Bronn , make no mistake . Duty , honor , friendship , what 's that to you ? No , do n't trouble yourself , we both know the answer . Still , you 're not stupid . Once we reached the Vale , Lady Stark had no more need of you ... but I did , and the one thing the Lannisters have never lacked for is gold . When the moment came to toss the dice , I was counting on your being smart enough to know where your best interest lay . Happily for me , you did . ";Tyrion;Stark,Lannister,Vale,;0.119047619048;9453;301
" Here , " said Bronn , squatting , " I 'll do it . ";Bronn;Tyrion,Mordane,;0.0;9455;301
" Well done , " Tyrion said . " Scum you may be , but you 're undeniably useful , and with a sword in your hand you 're almost as good as my brother Jaime . What do you want , Bronn ? Gold ? Land ? Women ? Keep me alive , and you 'll have it . ";Tyrion;Bronn,Mordane,;0.35;9458;301
Bronn blew gently on the fire , and the flames leapt up higher . " And if you die ? ";Bronn;Tyrion,Mordane,;0.25;9459;301
" Why then , I 'll have one mourner whose grief is sincere , " Tyrion said , grinning . " The gold ends when I do . ";Tyrion;Bronn,Mordane,;-0.15;9460;301
Bronn stood , tucked the flint back into his pouch , and tossed Tyrion his dagger . " Fair enough , " he said . " My sword 's yours , then ... but do n't go looking for me to bend the knee and m'lord you every time you take a shit . I 'm no man 's toady . ";Bronn;Tyrion,Mordane,;0.125;9462;301
" Nor any man 's friend , " Tyrion said . " I 've no doubt you'd betray me as quick as you did Lady Stark , if you saw a profit in it . If the day ever comes when you 're tempted to sell me out , remember this , Bronn-I 'll match their price , whatever it is . I like living . And now , do you think you could do something about finding us some supper ? ";Tyrion;Bronn,Stark,;0.0666666666667;9463;301
" Take care of the horses , " Bronn said , unsheathing the long dirk he wore at his hip .;Bronn;Tyrion,Mordane,;-0.05;9464;301
An hour later the horses had been rubbed down and fed , the fire was crackling away merrily , and a haunch of a young goat was turning above the flames , spitting and hissing . " All we lack now is some good wine to wash down our kid , " Tyrion said .;Tyrion;Bronn,Mordane,;0.0731481481481;9466;301
" That , a woman , and another dozen swords , " Bronn said .;Bronn;Tyrion,Mordane,;0.0;9467;301
There was something strangely reassuring about the rasping sound it made when he drew it down the steel . " It will be full dark soon , " the sellsword pointed out . " I 'll take first watch ... for all the good it will do us . It might be kinder to let them kill us in our sleep . ";Tyrion;Bronn,Mordane,;0.224074074074;9469;301
" Oh , I imagine they 'll be here long before it comes to sleep . ";Mordane;Tyrion,Bronn,;-0.05;9470;301
Bronn watched him across the fire . " You have a plan , " he said flatly , with a scrape of steel on stone .;Bronn;Tyrion,Mordane,;0.0;9472;301
" A hope , call it , " Tyrion said . " Another toss of the dice . ";Tyrion;Bronn,Mordane,;0.0;9473;301
" With our lives as the stake ? ";Bronn;Tyrion,Mordane,;0.0;9474;301
Tyrion shrugged . " What choice do we have ? ";Tyrion;Bronn,Mordane,;0.0;9475;301
He leaned over the fire and sawed a thin slice of meat from the kid . " Ahhhh , " he sighed happily as he chewed .;Bronn;Tyrion,Mordane,;-0.4;9476;301
Grease ran down his chin . " A bit tougher than I'd like , and in want of spicing , but I 'll not complain too loudly . If I were back at the Eyrie , I'd be dancing on a precipice in hopes of a boiled bean . ";Tyrion;I'd,;-0.0777777777778;9477;301
" And yet you gave the turnkey a purse of gold , " Bronn said .;Bronn;Tyrion,Mordane,;0.0;9478;301
" A Lannister always pays his debts . ";Mordane;Lannister,;0.0;9479;301
The gaoler 's eyes had gone big as boiled eggs as he yanked open the drawstring and beheld the glint of gold . " I kept the silver , " Tyrion had told him with a crooked smile , " but you were promised the gold , and there it is . ";Tyrion;Bronn,Mordane,;0.075;9481;301
It was more than a man like Mord could hope to earn in a lifetime of abusing prisoners . " And remember what I said , this is only a taste . If you ever grow tired of Lady Arryn 's service , present yourself at Casterly Rock , and I 'll pay you the rest of what I owe you . ";Mordane;Rock,;0.025;9482;301
He began to carve thick chunks of charred meat off the bone as Tyrion hollowed out two heels of stale bread to serve as trenchers . " If we do reach the river , what will you do then ? ";Tyrion;Bronn,Mordane,;-0.4;9485;301
" Oh , a whore and a featherbed and a flagon of wine , for a start . ";Bronn;Tyrion,Mordane,;0.0;9487;301
Tyrion held out his trencher , and Bronn filled it with meat . " And then to Casterly Rock or King 's Landing , I think . I have some questions that want answering , concerning a certain dagger . ";Tyrion;Bronn,Mordane,;0.307142857143;9488;301
The sellsword chewed and swallowed . " So you were telling it true ? It was not your knife ? ";Bronn;Tyrion,Mordane,;0.35;9489;301
Tyrion smiled thinly . " Do I look a liar to you ? ";Tyrion;Bronn,Mordane,;0.6;9490;301
Tyrion spread his shadowskin cloak on the ground and stretched out with his saddle for a pillow . " Our friends are taking their sweet time . ";Tyrion;Bronn,Mordane,;0.35;9492;301
" If I were them , I'd fear a trap , " Bronn said . " Why else would we be so open , if not to lure them in ? ";Bronn;I'd,;0.0;9493;301
Tyrion chuckled . " Then we ought to sing and send them fleeing in terror . ";Tyrion;Bronn,Mordane,;0.0;9494;301
" You 're mad , dwarf , " Bronn said as he cleaned the grease out from under his nails with his dirk .;Bronn;Tyrion,Mordane,;-0.625;9496;301
" Where 's your love of music , Bronn ? ";Tyrion;Bronn,Mordane,;0.5;9497;301
" If it was music you wanted , you should have gotten the singer to champion you . ";Bronn;Tyrion,Mordane,;0.0;9498;301
Tyrion grinned . " That would have been amusing . I can just see him fending off Ser Vardis with his woodharp . ";Tyrion;Bronn,Mordane,;0.6;9499;301
He resumed his whistling . " Do you know this song ? ";Bronn;Tyrion,Mordane,;0.0;9500;301
" You hear it here and there , in inns and whorehouses . ";Mordane;Tyrion,Bronn,;0.0;9502;301
" Myrish . ' The Seasons of My Love . ' Sweet and sad , if you understand the words . The first girl I ever bedded used to sing it , and I 've never been able to put it out of my head . ";Tyrion;Bronn,Mordane,;0.22;9503;301
It was a clear cold night and the stars shone down upon the mountains as bright and merciless as truth . " I met her on a night like this , " he heard himself saying . " Jaime and I were riding back from Lannisport when we heard a scream , and she came running out into the road with two men dogging her heels , shouting threats . My brother unsheathed his sword and went after them , while I dismounted to protect the girl . She was scarcely a year older than I was , dark-haired , slender , with a face that would break your heart . It certainly broke mine . Lowborn , half-starved , unwashed ... yet lovely . They'd torn the rags she was wearing half off her back , so I wrapped her in my cloak while Jaime chased the men into the woods . By the time he came trotting back , I'd gotten a name out of her , and a story . She was a crofter 's child , orphaned when her father died of fever , on her way to ... well , nowhere , really .;Bronn;They'd,Jaime,I'd,;-0.012962962963;9505;301
" Jaime was all in a lather to hunt down the men . It was not often outlaws dared prey on travelers so near to Casterly Rock , and he took it as an insult . The girl was too frightened to send off by herself , though , so I offered to take her to the closest inn and feed her while my brother rode back to the Rock for help .;Tyrion;Jaime,;-0.0185185185185;9506;301
" She was hungrier than I would have believed . We finished two whole chickens and part of a third , and drank a flagon of wine , talking . I was only thirteen , and the wine went to my head , I fear . The next thing I knew , I was sharing her bed . If she was shy , I was shyer . I 'll never know where I found the courage . When I broke her maidenhead , she wept , but afterward she kissed me and sang her little song , and by morning I was in love . ";Mordane;Tyrion,Bronn,;0.00178571428571;9507;301
" You ? ";Bronn;Tyrion,Mordane,;0.0;9508;301
" Absurd , is n't it ? ";Mordane;Tyrion,Bronn,;-0.5;9510;301
Tyrion began to whistle the song again . " I married her , " he finally admitted .;Tyrion;Bronn,Mordane,;0.25;9511;301
" A Lannister of Casterly Rock wed to a crofter 's daughter , " Bronn said . " How did you manage that ? ";Bronn;Rock,;0.0;9512;301
" Oh , you'd be astonished at what a boy can make of a few lies , fifty pieces of silver , and a drunken septon . I dared not bring my bride home to Casterly Rock , so I set her up in a cottage of her own , and for a fortnight we played at being man and wife . And then the septon sobered and confessed all to my lord father . ";Mordane;Tyrion,Bronn,;0.2;9513;301
Perhaps he was just tired . " That was the end of my marriage . ";Tyrion;Bronn,Mordane,;-0.4;9515;301
" He sent the girl away ? ";Bronn;Tyrion,Mordane,;0.0;9517;301
" He did better than that , " Tyrion said . " First he made my brother tell me the truth . The girl was a whore , you see . Jaime arranged the whole affair , the road , the outlaws , all of it . He thought it was time I had a woman . He paid double for a maiden , knowing it would be my first time .;Tyrion;Jaime,;0.24;9518;301
" After Jaime had made his confession , to drive home the lesson , Lord Tywin brought my wife in and gave her to his guards . They paid her fair enough . A silver for each man , how many whores command that high a price ? He sat me down in the corner of the barracks and bade me watch , and at the end she had so many silvers the coins were slipping through her fingers and rolling on the floor , she ... ";Bronn;Jaime,;0.229206349206;9519;301
Tyrion cleared his throat and turned away from the fire , to gaze out into darkness . " Lord Tywin had me go last , " he said in a quiet voice . " And he gave me a gold coin to pay her , because I was a Lannister , and worth more . ";Tyrion;Lord,Lannister,;0.2;9521;301
After a time he heard the noise again , the rasp of steel on stone as Bronn sharpened his sword . " Thirteen or thirty or three , I would have killed the man who did that to me . ";Bronn;Tyrion,Mordane,;0.0;9522;301
Tyrion swung around to face him . " You may get that chance one day . Remember what I told you . A Lannister always pays his debts . ";Tyrion;Lannister,;0.0;9523;301
He yawned . " I think I will try and sleep . Wake me if we 're about to die . ";Bronn;Tyrion,Mordane,;0.0;9524;301
" Tyrion . ";Mordane;Tyrion,Bronn,;0.0;9529;301
Tyrion held up a hand : stay still , it said . " Come share our fire , the night is cold , " he called out to the creeping shadows . " I fear we 've no wine to offer you , but you 're welcome to some of our goat . ";Tyrion;Bronn,Mordane,;0.1;9534;301
Tyrion saw the glint of moonlight on metal . " Our mountain , " a voice called out from the trees , deep and hard and unfriendly . " Our goat . ";Tyrion;Bronn,Mordane,;-0.145833333333;9536;301
" Your goat , " Tyrion agreed . " Who are you ? ";Tyrion;Bronn,Mordane,;0.0;9537;301
" When you meet your gods , " a different voice replied , " say it was Gunthor son of Gurn of the Stone Crows who sent you to them . ";Bronn;Tyrion,Mordane,;0.0;9538;301
" And Shagga son of Dolf . ";Tyrion;Bronn,Mordane,;0.0;9540;301
He waited until they were done shouting out their names before he gave them answer . " I am Tyrion son of Tywin , of the Clan Lannister , the Lions of the Rock . We will gladly pay you for the goat we ate . ";Tyrion;Conn,Gunthor,Bronn,Shagga,;0.0;9547;302
" What do you have to give us , Tyrion son of Tywin ? ";Gunthor;Tyrion,Conn,Bronn,Shagga,;0.0;9548;302
" There is silver in my purse , " Tyrion told them . " This hauberk I wear is large for me , but it should fit Conn nicely , and the battle-axe I carry would suit Shagga 's mighty hand far better than that wood-axe he holds . ";Tyrion;nicely,;0.322857142857;9550;302
" The half man would pay us with our own coin , " said Conn .;Conn;Tyrion,Gunthor,Bronn,Shagga,;0.216666666667;9551;302
" Conn speaks truly , " Gunthor said . " Your silver is ours . Your horses are ours . Your hauberk and your battle-axe and the knife at your belt , those are ours too . You have nothing to give us but your lives . How would you like to die , Tyrion son of Tywin ? ";Gunthor;Conn,;0.0;9552;302
" In my own bed , with a belly full of wine and a maiden 's mouth around my cock , at the age of eighty , " he replied .;Tyrion;Conn,Gunthor,Bronn,Shagga,;0.475;9553;302
The others seemed less amused . " Conn , take their horses , " Gunthor commanded . " Kill the other and seize the halfman . He can milk the goats and make the mothers laugh . ";Gunthor;Tyrion,Conn,Bronn,Shagga,;0.00277777777778;9555;302
Bronn sprang to his feet . " Who dies first ? ";Bronn;Tyrion,Conn,Gunthor,Shagga,;0.25;9556;302
" No ! ";Gunthor;Tyrion,Conn,Bronn,Shagga,;0.0;9557;302
Tyrion said sharply . " Gunthor son of Gurn , hear me . My House is rich and powerful . If the Stone Crows will see us safely through these mountains , my lord father will shower you with gold . ";Tyrion;House,;0.3375;9558;302
" The gold of a lowland lord is as worthless as a half man 's promises , " Gunthor said .;Gunthor;Tyrion,Conn,Bronn,Shagga,;-0.483333333333;9559;302
" Half a man I may be , " Tyrion said , " yet I have the courage to face my enemies . What do the Stone Crows do , but hide behind rocks and shiver with fear as the knights of the Vale ride by ? ";Tyrion;Stone,;-0.283333333333;9560;302
He did his best not to flinch . " Are these the best weapons you could steal ? ";Gunthor;Tyrion,Conn,Bronn,Shagga,;1.0;9563;302
he said . " Good enough for killing sheep , perhaps ... if the sheep do not fight back . My father 's smiths shit better steel . ";Tyrion;Conn,Gunthor,Bronn,Shagga,;0.19;9564;302
" Little boyman , " Shagga roared , " will you mock my axe after I chop off your manhood and feed it to the goats ? ";Shagga;Tyrion,Conn,Gunthor,Bronn,;-0.1875;9565;302
But Gunthor raised a hand . " No . I would hear his words . The mothers go hungry , and steel fills more mouths than gold . What would you give us for your lives , Tyrion son of Tywin ? Swords ? Lances ? Mail ? ";Gunthor;Tyrion,Conn,Bronn,Shagga,;0.5;9566;302
" All that , and more , Gunthor son of Gurn , " Tyrion Lannister replied , smiling . " I will give you the Vale of Arryn . ";Tyrion;Vale,;0.5;9567;302
" You are quite certain these were more than brigands ? ";Varys;;0.357142857143;9578;303
" Brigands , Lord Varys ? ";Serrett;;0.0;9589;304
Ser Raymun Darry 's voice dripped scorn . " Oh , they were brigands , beyond a doubt . Lannister brigands . ";Serrett;;0.0;9590;304
Sad-eyed Ser Karyl Vance , who would have been handsome but for the winestain birthmark that discolored his face , gestured at the kneeling villagers . " This is all the remains of the holdfast of Sherrer , Lord Eddard . The rest are dead , along with the people of Wendish Town and the Mummer 's Ford . ";Vance;Ned,Serrett,Black,Varys,;0.15;9597;305
" Rise , " Ned commanded the villagers .;Ned;Vance,Serrett,Black,Varys,;0.0;9598;305
He never trusted what a man told him from his knees . " All of you , up . ";Vance;Ned,Serrett,Black,Varys,;0.0;9599;305
" Joss , " Ser Raymun Darry said to a plump balding man in a brewer 's apron . " Tell the Hand what happened at Sherrer . ";Serrett;Vance,Ned,Black,Varys,;0.0;9603;305
Joss nodded . " If it please His Grace - ";Vance;Grace,;0.0;9604;305
" His Grace is hunting across the Blackwater , " Ned said , wondering how a man could live his whole life a few days ride from the Red Keep and still have no notion what his king looked like .;Ned;Grace,;0.0340909090909;9605;305
Black and white and grey , all the shades of truth . " I am Lord Eddard Stark , the King 's Hand . Tell me who you are and what you know of these raiders . ";Black;Lord,;-0.104166666667;9607;305
" I keep ... I kept ... I kept an alehouse , m'lord , in Sherrer , by the stone bridge . The finest ale south of the Neck , everyone said so , begging your pardons , m'lord . It 's gone now like all the rest , m'lord . They come and drank their fill and spilled the rest before they fired my roof , and they would of spilled my blood too , if they'd caught me . M'lord . ";Ned;Vance,Serrett,Black,Varys,;0.0;9608;305
" They burnt us out , " a farmer beside him said . " Come riding in the dark , up from the south , and fired the fields and the houses alike , killing them as tried to stop them . They were n't no raiders , though , m'lord . They had no mind to steal our stock , not these , they butchered my milk cow where she stood and left her for the flies and the crows . ";Serrett;Vance,Ned,Black,Varys,;-0.075;9609;305
" They rode down my ' prentice boy , " said a squat man with a smith 's muscles and a bandage around his head .;Ned;Vance,Serrett,Black,Varys,;-0.155555555556;9610;305
He had put on his finest clothes to come to court , but his breeches were patched , his cloak travel-stained and dusty . " Chased him back and forth across the fields on their horses , poking at him with their lances like it was a game , them laughing and the boy stumbling and screaming till the big one pierced him clean through . ";Serrett;Vance,Ned,Black,Varys,;-0.0866666666667;9611;305
The girl on her knees craned her head up at Ned , high above her on the throne . " They killed my mother too , Your Grace . And they ... they ... ";Ned;Vance,Serrett,Black,Varys,;0.08;9612;305
Ser Raymun Darry took up the tale . " At Wendish Town , the people sought shelter in their holdfast , but the walls were timbered . The raiders piled straw against the wood and burnt them all alive . When the Wendish folk opened their gates to flee the fire , they shot them down with arrows as they came running out , even women with suckling babes . ";Serrett;Vance,Ned,Black,Varys,;-0.0277777777778;9615;305
" Oh , dreadful , " murmured Varys . " How cruel can men be ? ";Varys;Vance,Ned,Serrett,Black,;-1.0;9616;305
" They would of done the same for us , but the Sherrer holdfast 's made of stone , " Joss said . " Some wanted to smoke us out , but the big one said there was riper fruit up river , and they made for the Mummer 's Ford . ";Ned;Vance,Serrett,Black,Varys,;0.0;9617;305
What Eddard Stark was doing sitting there he would never comprehend , yet there he sat , and these people looked to him for justice . " What proof do you have that these were Lannisters ? ";Stark;Lannister,;-0.2;9625;306
he asked , trying to keep his fury under control . " Did they wear crimson cloaks or fly a lion banner ? ";Lord;Stark,Marq,Vance,Littlefinger,;0.8;9626;306
" Even Lannisters are not so blind stupid as that , " Ser Marq Piper snapped .;Marq;Lannister,;-0.65;9627;306
" Every man among them was mounted and mailed , my lord , " Ser Karyl answered calmly . " They were armed with steel-tipped lances and longswords , with battle-axes for the butchering . ";Vance;Stark,Marq,Littlefinger,Lord,;0.0;9629;306
He gestured toward one of the ragged survivors . " You . Yes , you , no one 's going to hurt you . Tell the Hand what you told me . ";Marq;Stark,Vance,Littlefinger,Lord,;0.0;9630;306
The old man bobbed his head . " Concerning their horses , " he said , " it were warhorses they rode . Many a year I worked in old Ser Willum 's stables , so I knows the difference . Not a one of these ever pulled a plow , gods bear witness if I 'm wrong . ";Lord;Stark,Marq,Vance,Littlefinger,;0.05;9631;306
" Well-mounted brigands , " observed Littlefinger . " Perhaps they stole the horses from the last place they raided . ";Littlefinger;Stark,Marq,Vance,Lord,;0.0;9632;306
" How many men were there in this raiding party ? ";Marq;Stark,Vance,Littlefinger,Lord,;0.5;9633;306
" A hundred , at the least , " Joss answered , in the same instant as the bandaged smith said , " Fifty , " and the grandmother behind him , " Hunnerds and hunnerds , m'lord , an army they was . ";Vance;Stark,Marq,Littlefinger,Lord,;-0.175;9635;306
" You are more right than you know , goodwoman , " Lord Eddard told her . " You say they flew no banners . What of the armor they wore ? Did any of you note ornaments or decorations , devices on shield or helm ? ";Lord;Stark,Marq,Vance,Littlefinger,;0.392857142857;9636;306
The brewer , Joss , shook his head . " It grieves me , m'lord , but no , the armor they showed us was plain , only ... the one who led them , he was armored like the rest , but there was no mistaking him all the same . It was the size of him , m'lord . Those as say the giants are all dead never saw this one , I swear . Big as an ox he was , and a voice like stone breaking . ";Marq;Stark,Vance,Littlefinger,Lord,;-0.0828571428571;9637;306
" The Mountain ! ";Lord;Stark,Marq,Vance,Littlefinger,;0.0;9638;306
Ser Marq said loudly . " Can any man doubt it ? This was Gregor Clegane 's work . ";Marq;Clegane,;0.0;9639;306
Grand Maester Pycelle rose ponderously from the council table , his chain of office clinking . " Ser Marq , with respect , you cannot know that this outlaw was Ser Gregor . There are many large men in the realm . ";Maester;Gregor,;0.453571428571;9647;307
" As large as the Mountain That Rides ? ";Pycelle;Maester,Vance,Raymun,Marq,Ned,;0.214285714286;9648;307
Ser Karyl said . " I have never met one . ";Vance;Maester,Raymun,Pycelle,Marq,Ned,;0.0;9649;307
" Nor has any man here , " Ser Raymun added hotly . " Even his brother is a pup beside him . My lords , open your eyes . Do you need to see his seal on the corpses ? It was Gregor . ";Raymun;Gregor,;0.0;9650;307
" Why should Ser Gregor turn brigand ? ";Maester;Gregor,;0.0;9651;307
Pycelle asked . " By the grace of his liege lord , he holds a stout keep and lands of his own . The man is an anointed knight . ";Pycelle;Maester,Vance,Raymun,Marq,Ned,;0.6;9652;307
" A false knight ! ";Maester;Vance,Raymun,Pycelle,Marq,Ned,;-0.5;9653;307
Ser Marq said . " Lord Tywin 's mad dog . ";Marq;Maester,Vance,Raymun,Pycelle,Ned,;-0.625;9654;307
" My lord Hand , " Pycelle declared in a stiff voice , " I urge you to remind this good knight that Lord Tywin Lannister is the father of our own gracious queen . ";Pycelle;Lord,;0.345238095238;9655;307
" Thank you , Grand Maester Pycelle , " Ned said . " I fear we might have forgotten that if you had not pointed it out . ";Ned;Maester,Vance,Raymun,Pycelle,Marq,;0.5;9656;307
At the council table below , Petyr Baelish lost interest in his quill and leaned forward . " Ser Marq , Ser Karyl , Ser Raymun-perhaps I might ask you a question ? These holdfasts were under your protection . Where were you when all this slaughtering and burning was going on ? ";Petyr;Vance,Serrett,Littlefinger,Marq,Lord,Maester,Ned,House,Loras,Flowers,Varys,;0.0;9663;308
Ser Karyl Vance answered . " I was attending my lord father in the pass below the Golden Tooth , as was Ser Marq . When the word of these outrages reached Ser Edmure Tully , he sent word that we should take a small force of men to find what survivors we could and bring them to the king . ";Vance;Marq,;0.025;9664;308
Ser Raymun Darry spoke up . " Ser Edmure had summoned me to Riverrun with all my strength . I was camped across the river from his walls , awaiting his commands , when the word reached me . By the time I could return to my own lands , Clegane and his vermin were back across the Red Fork , riding for Lannister 's hills . ";Serrett;Edmure,;0.2;9665;308
Littlefinger stroked the point of his beard thoughtfully . " And if they come again , ser ? ";Littlefinger;Petyr,Vance,Serrett,Marq,Lord,Maester,Ned,House,Loras,Flowers,Varys,;0.0;9666;308
" If they come again , we 'll use their blood to water the fields they burnt , " Ser Marq Piper declared hotly .;Marq;Petyr,Vance,Serrett,Littlefinger,Lord,Maester,Ned,House,Loras,Flowers,Varys,;0.0;9667;308
" Ser Edmure has sent men to every village and holdfast within a day 's ride of the border , " Ser Karyl explained . " The next raider will not have such an easy time of it . ";Vance;Edmure,;0.144444444444;9668;308
" If your fields and holdfasts are safe from harm , " Lord Petyr was saying , " what then do you ask of the throne ? ";Lord;Petyr,Vance,Serrett,Littlefinger,Marq,Maester,Ned,House,Loras,Flowers,Varys,;0.5;9672;308
" The lords of the Trident keep the king 's peace , " Ser Raymun Darry said . " The Lannisters have broken it . We ask leave to answer them , steel for steel . We ask justice for the smallfolk of Sherrer and Wendish Town and the Mummer 's Ford . ";Serrett;Lannister,;-0.4;9673;308
" Edmure agrees , we must pay Gregor Clegane back his bloody coin , " Ser Marq declared , " but old Lord Hoster commanded us to come here and beg the king 's leave before we strike . ";Marq;Edmure,Lord,;-0.233333333333;9674;308
Grand Maester Pycelle was on his feet again . " My lord Hand , if these good folk believe that Ser Gregor has forsaken his holy vows for plunder and rape , let them go to his liege lord and make their complaint . These crimes are no concern of the throne . Let them seek Lord Tywin 's justice . ";Maester;Gregor,Lord,;0.283333333333;9680;308
" It is all the king 's justice , " Ned told him . " North , south , east , or west , all we do we do in Robert 's name . ";Ned;Petyr,Vance,Serrett,Littlefinger,Marq,Lord,Maester,House,Loras,Flowers,Varys,;0.0;9681;308
" The king 's justice , " Grand Maester Pycelle said . " So it is , and so we should defer this matter until the king - ";Maester;Petyr,Vance,Serrett,Littlefinger,Marq,Lord,Ned,House,Loras,Flowers,Varys,;0.5;9682;308
" The king is hunting across the river and may not return for days , " Lord Eddard said . " Robert bid me to sit here in his place , to listen with his ears , and to speak with his voice . I mean to do just that ... though I agree that he must be told . ";Lord;Petyr,Vance,Serrett,Littlefinger,Marq,Maester,Ned,House,Loras,Flowers,Varys,;-0.3125;9683;308
He saw a familiar face beneath the tapestries . " Ser Robar . ";Ned;Petyr,Vance,Serrett,Littlefinger,Marq,Lord,Maester,House,Loras,Flowers,Varys,;0.375;9684;308
Ser Robar Royce stepped forward and bowed . " My lord . ";Serrett;Petyr,Vance,Littlefinger,Marq,Lord,Maester,Ned,House,Loras,Flowers,Varys,;0.0;9685;308
" Your father is hunting with the king , " Ned said . " Will you bring them word of what was said and done here today ? ";Ned;Petyr,Vance,Serrett,Littlefinger,Marq,Lord,Maester,House,Loras,Flowers,Varys,;0.0;9686;308
" At once , my lord . ";Serrett;Petyr,Vance,Littlefinger,Marq,Lord,Maester,Ned,House,Loras,Flowers,Varys,;0.0;9687;308
" Do we have your leave to take our vengeance against Ser Gregor , then ? ";Marq;Petyr,Vance,Serrett,Littlefinger,Lord,Maester,Ned,House,Loras,Flowers,Varys,;0.0;9688;308
" Vengeance ? ";Serrett;Petyr,Vance,Littlefinger,Marq,Lord,Maester,Ned,House,Loras,Flowers,Varys,;0.0;9690;308
Ned said . " I thought we were speaking of justice . Burning Clegane 's fields and slaughtering his people will not restore the king 's peace , only your injured pride . ";Ned;Clegane,;0.0;9691;308
He glanced away before the young knight could voice his outraged protest , and addressed the villagers . " People of Sherrer , I cannot give you back your homes or your crops , nor can I restore your dead to life . But perhaps I can give you some small measure of justice , in the name of our king , Robert . ";Serrett;Petyr,Vance,Littlefinger,Marq,Lord,Maester,Ned,House,Loras,Flowers,Varys,;-0.25;9692;308
He did his best to ignore the pain ; it was no moment to let them see his weakness . " The First Men believed that the judge who called for death should wield the sword , and in the north we hold to that still . I mislike sending another to do my killing ... yet it seems I have no choice . ";Ned;Petyr,Vance,Serrett,Littlefinger,Marq,Lord,Maester,House,Loras,Flowers,Varys,;0.625;9695;308
" Lord Eddard ! ";Serrett;Petyr,Vance,Littlefinger,Marq,Lord,Maester,Ned,House,Loras,Flowers,Varys,;0.0;9697;308
He wore pale blue silk , his belt a linked chain of golden roses , the sigil of his House . " I beg you the honor of acting in your place . Give this task to me , my lord , and I swear I shall not fail you . ";House;Petyr,Vance,Serrett,Littlefinger,Marq,Lord,Maester,Ned,Loras,Flowers,Varys,;-0.05;9700;308
Littlefinger chuckled . " Ser Loras , if we send you off alone , Ser Gregor will send us back your head with a plum stuffed in that pretty mouth of yours . The Mountain is not the sort to bend his neck to any man 's justice . ";Littlefinger;Gregor,Mountain,;0.125;9701;308
" I do not fear Gregor Clegane , " Ser Loras said haughtily .;Loras;Clegane,;0.0;9702;308
His eyes searched the faces along the wall . " Lord Beric , " he called out . " Thoros of Myr . Ser Gladden . Lord Lothar . ";Ned;Petyr,Vance,Serrett,Littlefinger,Marq,Lord,Maester,House,Loras,Flowers,Varys,;0.0;9704;308
The men named stepped forward one by one . " Each of you is to assemble twenty men , to bring my word to Gregor 's keep . Twenty of my own guards shall go with you . Lord Beric Dondarrion , you shall have the command , as befits your rank . ";Serrett;Petyr,Vance,Littlefinger,Marq,Lord,Maester,Ned,House,Loras,Flowers,Varys,;-0.1;9705;308
The young lord with the red-gold hair bowed . " As you command , Lord Eddard . ";Marq;Petyr,Vance,Serrett,Littlefinger,Lord,Maester,Ned,House,Loras,Flowers,Varys,;0.1;9706;308
Ned raised his voice , so it carried to the far end of the throne room . " In the name of Robert of the House Baratheon , the First of his Name , King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men , Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm , by the word of Eddard of the House Stark , his Hand , I charge you to ride to the westlands with all haste , to cross the Red Fork of the Trident under the king 's flag , and there bring the king 's justice to the false knight Gregor Clegane , and to all those who shared in his crimes . I denounce him , and attaint him , and strip him of all rank and titles , of all lands and incomes and holdings , and do sentence him to death . May the gods take pity on his soul . ";Ned;Redwyne,;-0.1;9707;308
When the echo of his words had died away , the Knight of Flowers seemed perplexed . " Lord Eddard , what of me ? ";Flowers;Petyr,Vance,Serrett,Littlefinger,Marq,Lord,Maester,Ned,House,Loras,Varys,;0.4;9708;308
From on high , Loras Tyrell seemed almost as young as Robb . " No one doubts your valor , Ser Loras , but we are about justice here , and what you seek is vengeance . ";Loras;Petyr,Vance,Serrett,Littlefinger,Marq,Lord,Maester,Ned,House,Flowers,Varys,;0.13;9710;308
He looked back to Lord Beric . " Ride at first light . These things are best done quickly . ";Lord;Petyr,Vance,Serrett,Littlefinger,Marq,Maester,Ned,House,Loras,Flowers,Varys,;0.4125;9711;308
He held up a hand . " The throne will hear no more petitions today . ";Ned;Petyr,Vance,Serrett,Littlefinger,Marq,Lord,Maester,House,Loras,Flowers,Varys,;0.5;9712;308
Littlefinger and Grand Maester Pycelle had already taken their leave . " You are a bolder man than I , my lord , " the eunuch said softly .;Littlefinger;Petyr,Vance,Serrett,Marq,Lord,Maester,Ned,House,Loras,Flowers,Varys,;0.5;9716;308
" How so , Lord Varys ? ";Ned;Petyr,Vance,Serrett,Littlefinger,Marq,Lord,Maester,House,Loras,Flowers,Varys,;0.0;9717;308
" Had it been me up there , I should have sent Ser Loras . He so wanted to go ... and a man who has the Lannisters for his enemies would do well to make the Tyrells his friends . ";Serrett;Loras,;0.0;9720;308
" Ser Loras is young , " said Ned . " I daresay he will outgrow the disappointment . ";Ned;Loras,;-0.25;9721;308
" And Ser Ilyn ? ";Serrett;Petyr,Vance,Littlefinger,Marq,Lord,Maester,Ned,House,Loras,Flowers,Varys,;0.0;9722;308
The eunuch stroked a plump , powdered cheek . " He is the King 's Justice , after all . Sending other men to do his office ... some might construe that as a grave insult . ";Ned;King,;-0.125;9723;308
" No slight was intended . ";Serrett;Petyr,Vance,Littlefinger,Marq,Lord,Maester,Ned,House,Loras,Flowers,Varys,;-0.166666666667;9724;308
In truth , Ned did not trust the mute knight , though perhaps that was only because he misliked executioners . " I remind you , the Paynes are bannermen to House Lannister . I thought it best to choose men who owed Lord Tywin no fealty . ";Ned;Payne,;0.5;9725;308
" Very prudent , no doubt , " Varys said . " Still , I chanced to see Ser Ilyn in the back of the hall , staring at us with those pale eyes of his , and I must say , he did not look pleased , though to be sure it is hard to tell with our silent knight . I hope he outgrows his disappointment as well . He does so love his work ... ";Varys;Serrett,;0.101041666667;9726;308
" He would n't send Ser Loras , " Sansa told Jeyne Poole that night as they shared a cold supper by lamplight . " I think it was because of his leg . ";Sansa;Loras,;-0.6;9730;309
" His leg ? ";Sansa;;0.0;9733;309
She was a pretty , dark-haired girl of Sansa 's own age . " Did Ser Loras hurt his leg ? ";Sansa;Loras,;0.425;9735;309
" Not his leg , " Sansa said , nibbling delicately at a chicken leg . " Father 's leg , silly . It hurts him ever so much , it makes him cross . Otherwise I 'm certain he would have sent Ser Loras . ";Sansa;Loras,;-0.157142857143;9736;309
That was when Lord Baelish had said , " Oh , I do n't know , Septa . Some of her lord father 's decisions could do with a bit of questioning . The young lady is as wise as she is lovely . ";Lord;Mordane,Jeyne,Sansa,Night,;0.433333333333;9744;310
Septa Mordane had been very upset to realize that Lord Baelish had overheard them . " The girl was just talking , my lord , " she'd said . " Foolish chatter . She meant nothing by the comment . ";Mordane;Lord,Jeyne,Sansa,Night,;0.2;9746;310
Lord Baelish stroked his little pointed beard and said , " Nothing ? Tell me , child , why would you have sent Ser Loras ? ";Lord;Loras,;-0.1875;9747;310
The king 's councillor smiled . " Well , those are not the reasons I'd have given , but ... ";Sansa;I'd,;0.6;9749;310
He had touched her cheek , his thumb lightly tracing the line of a cheekbone . " Life is not a song , sweetling . You may learn that one day to your sorrow . ";Lord;Life,;0.0;9750;310
" Ser Ilyn 's the King 's Justice , not Ser Loras , " Jeyne said . " Lord Eddard should have sent him . ";Jeyne;Serrett,Lord,;0.0;9752;310
He made her feel as though something dead were slithering over her naked skin . " Ser Ilyn 's almost like a second monster . I 'm glad Father did n't pick him . ";Sansa;Father,;0.075;9755;310
" Lord Beric is as much a hero as Ser Loras . He 's ever so brave and gallant . ";Jeyne;Lord,;0.45;9756;310
" I suppose , " Sansa said doubtfully .;Sansa;Lord,Mordane,Jeyne,Night,;0.0;9757;310
It would have been unkind to say so , however , so Sansa took a sip of milk and changed the subject . " I had a dream that Joffrey would be the one to take the white hart , " she said .;Sansa;Joffrey,;-0.0833333333333;9761;310
" A dream ? Truly ? Did Prince Joffrey just go up to it and touch it with his bare hand and do it no harm ? ";Jeyne;Joffrey,;0.05;9765;310
" No , " Sansa said . " He shot it with a golden arrow and brought it back for me . ";Sansa;Lord,Mordane,Jeyne,Night,;0.15;9766;310
" I saw your sister this afternoon , " Jeyne blurted out , as if she'd been reading Sansa 's thoughts . " She was walking through the stables on her hands . Why would she do a thing like that ? ";Jeyne;Lord,Mordane,Sansa,Night,;0.0;9772;310
" I 'm sure I do n't know why Arya does anything . ";Sansa;Arya,;0.5;9773;310
Even when she went riding , she liked the boy to saddle the horse and bring it to her in the yard . " Do you want to hear about the court or not ? ";Lord;Mordane,Jeyne,Sansa,Night,;0.6;9775;310
" I do , " Jeyne said .;Jeyne;Lord,Mordane,Sansa,Night,;0.0;9776;310
" There was a black brother , " Sansa said , " begging men for the Wall , only he was kind of old and smelly . ";Sansa;Lord,Mordane,Jeyne,Night,;0.133333333333;9777;310
If this was what the Night 's Watch was truly like , she felt sorry for her bastard half brother , Jon . " Father asked if there were any knights in the hall who would do honor to their houses by taking the black , but no one came forward , so he gave this Yoren his pick of the king 's dungeons and sent him on his way . And later these two brothers came before him , freeriders from the Dornish Marches , and pledged their swords to the service of the king . Father accepted their oaths ... ";Night;Father,;-0.208333333333;9782;310
Jeyne yawned . " Are there any lemon cakes ? ";Jeyne;Lord,Mordane,Sansa,Night,;0.0;9783;310
Sansa did not like being interrupted , but she had to admit , lemon cakes sounded more interesting than most of what had gone on in the throne room . " Let 's see , " she said .;Sansa;Lord,Mordane,Jeyne,Night,;0.5;9784;310
The Tower of the Hand seemed so empty after they left that Sansa was even pleased to see Arya when she went down to break her fast . " Where is everyone ? ";Sansa;Mordane,Arya,;0.0888888888889;9794;311
her sister wanted to know as she ripped the skin from a blood orange . " Did Father send them to hunt down Jaime Lannister ? ";Arya;Father,;-0.155555555556;9795;311
Sansa sighed . " They rode with Lord Beric , to behead Ser Gregor Clegane . ";Sansa;Clegane,;0.0;9796;311
She turned to Septa Mordane , who was eating porridge with a wooden spoon . " Septa , will Lord Beric spike Ser Gregor 's head on his own gate or bring it back here for the king ? ";Mordane;Lord,;0.2;9797;311
The septa was horror-struck . " A lady does not discuss such things over her porridge . Where are your courtesies , Sansa ? I swear , of late you 've been near as bad as your sister . ";Sansa;Mordane,Arya,;-0.204166666667;9799;311
" What did Gregor do ? ";Arya;Gregor,;0.0;9800;311
" He burned down a holdfast and murdered a lot of people , women and children too . ";Sansa;Mordane,Arya,;-0.155555555556;9802;311
Arya screwed up her face in a scowl . " Jaime Lannister murdered Jory and Heward and Wyl , and the Hound murdered Mycah . Somebody should have beheaded them . ";Arya;Lannister,Jory,;0.0;9803;311
" It 's not the same , " Sansa said . " The Hound is Joffrey 's sworn shield . Your butcher 's boy attacked the prince . ";Sansa;Hound,Joffrey,;0.0;9804;311
" Liar , " Arya said .;Arya;Sansa,Mordane,;0.0;9805;311
" Go ahead , call me all the names you want , " Sansa said airily . " You wo n't dare when I 'm married to Joffrey . You 'll have to bow to me and call me Your Grace . ";Sansa;Grace,;0.25;9807;311
" You have juice on your face , Your Grace , " Arya said .;Arya;Sansa,Mordane,;0.0;9810;311
When she saw what the fruit in her lap had done to her beautiful ivory silk dress , she shrieked again . " You 're horrible , " she screamed at her sister . " They should have killed you instead of Lady ! ";Sansa;Mordane,Arya,;-0.125;9813;311
Septa Mordane came lurching to her feet . " Your lord father will hear of this ! Go to your chambers , at once . At once ! ";Mordane;Sansa,Arya,;0.0;9814;311
" Me too ? ";Arya;Sansa,Mordane,;0.0;9815;311
Tears welled in Sansa 's eyes . " That 's not fair . ";Sansa;Mordane,Arya,;0.7;9816;311
" The matter is not subject to discussion . Go ! ";Arya;Sansa,Mordane,;-0.208333333333;9817;311
The blood orange had left a blotchy red stain on the silk . " I hate her ! ";Sansa;Mordane,Arya,;-0.333333333333;9822;311
It was midday when Septa Mordane knocked upon her door . " Sansa . Your lord father will see you now . ";Mordane;Sansa,Arya,;0.0;9827;311
Sansa sat up . " Lady , " she whispered .;Sansa;Mordane,Arya,;0.0;9828;311
" Sansa . ";Lady;Lord,Sansa,Arya,Stark,Father,Mordane,;0.0;9835;312
The rap came again , sharply . " Do you hear me ? ";Sansa;Lady,Lord,Arya,Stark,Father,Mordane,;0.0;9836;312
" Yes , Septa , " she called out . " Might I have a moment to dress , please ? ";Arya;Lady,Lord,Sansa,Stark,Father,Mordane,;0.0;9837;312
Lord Eddard was bent over a huge leather-bound book when Septa Mordane marched her into the solar , his plaster-wrapped leg stiff beneath the table . " Come here , Sansa , " he said , not unkindly , when the septa had gone for her sister . " Sit beside me . ";Lord;Lady,Sansa,Arya,Stark,Father,Mordane,;0.0928571428571;9839;312
Sansa had put on a lovely pale green damask gown and a look of remorse , but her sister was still wearing the ratty leathers and roughspun she'd worn at breakfast . " Here is the other one , " the septa announced .;Sansa;Lady,Lord,Arya,Stark,Father,Mordane,;0.0583333333333;9842;312
" My thanks , Septa Mordane . I would talk to my daughters alone , if you would be so kind . ";Arya;Lady,Lord,Sansa,Stark,Father,Mordane,;0.4;9843;312
" Arya started it , " Sansa said quickly , anxious to have the first word . " She called me a liar and threw an orange at me and spoiled my dress , the ivory silk , the one Queen Cersei gave me when I was betrothed to Prince Joffrey . She hates that I 'm going to marry the prince . She tries to spoil everything , Father , she ca n't stand for anything to be beautiful or nice or splendid . ";Sansa;Arya,Cersei,;0.363888888889;9845;312
" Enough , Sansa . ";Father;Lady,Lord,Sansa,Arya,Stark,Mordane,;0.0;9846;312
Arya raised her eyes . " I 'm sorry , Father . I was wrong and I beg my sweet sister 's forgiveness . ";Arya;Lady,Lord,Sansa,Stark,Father,Mordane,;-0.216666666667;9848;312
Finally she found her voice . " What about my dress ? ";Sansa;Lady,Lord,Arya,Stark,Father,Mordane,;0.0;9850;312
" Maybe ... I could wash it , " Arya said doubtfully .;Arya;Lady,Lord,Sansa,Stark,Father,Mordane,;0.0;9851;312
" Washing wo n't do any good , " Sansa said . " Not if you scrubbed all day and all night . The silk is ruined . ";Sansa;Lady,Lord,Arya,Stark,Father,Mordane,;0.65;9852;312
" Then I 'll ... make you a new one , " Arya said .;Arya;Lady,Lord,Sansa,Stark,Father,Mordane,;0.136363636364;9853;312
Sansa threw back her head in disdain . " You ? You could n't sew a dress fit to clean the pigsties . ";Sansa;Lady,Lord,Arya,Stark,Father,Mordane,;0.255555555556;9854;312
Their father sighed . " I did not call you here to talk of dresses . I 'm sending you both back to Winterfell . ";Father;Lady,Lord,Sansa,Arya,Stark,Mordane,;0.0;9855;312
" You ca n't , " Arya said .;Arya;Lady,Lord,Sansa,Stark,Father,Mordane,;0.0;9858;312
" Please , Father , " Sansa managed at last . " Please do n't . ";Sansa;Lady,Lord,Arya,Stark,Father,Mordane,;0.0;9859;312
Eddard Stark favored his daughters with a tired smile . " At last we 've found something you agree on . ";Stark;Lady,Lord,Sansa,Arya,Father,Mordane,;0.1;9860;312
" I did n't do anything wrong , " Sansa pleaded with him . " I do n't want to go back . ";Sansa;Lady,Lord,Arya,Stark,Father,Mordane,;-0.25;9861;312
She could not bear the thought of losing it all . " Send Arya away , she started it , Father , I swear it . I 'll be good , you 'll see , just let me stay and I promise to be as fine and noble and courteous as the queen . ";Arya;Arya,;0.566666666667;9864;312
Father 's mouth twitched strangely . " Sansa , I 'm not sending you away for fighting , though the gods know I 'm sick of you two squabbling . I want you back in Winterfell for your own safety . Three of my men were cut down like dogs not a league from where we sit , and what does Robert do ? He goes hunting . ";Father;Robert,;-0.0674603174603;9865;312
Arya was chewing at her lip in that disgusting way she had . " Can we take Syrio back with us ? ";Arya;Syrio,;-0.5;9866;312
" Who cares about your stupid dancing master ? ";Father;Lady,Lord,Sansa,Arya,Stark,Mordane,;-0.8;9867;312
Sansa flared . " Father , I only just now remembered , I ca n't go away , I 'm to marry Prince Joffrey . ";Sansa;Joffrey,;0.0;9868;312
She tried to smile bravely for him . " I love him , Father , I truly truly do , I love him as much as Queen Naerys loved Prince Aemon the Dragonknight , as much as Jonquil loved Ser Florian . I want to be his queen and have his babies . ";Arya;Naerys,Prince,;0.414285714286;9869;312
" Sweet one , " her father said gently , " listen to me . When you 're old enough , I will make you a match with a high lord who 's worthy of you , someone brave and gentle and strong . This match with Joffrey was a terrible mistake . That boy is no Prince Aemon , you must believe me . ";Sansa;Joffrey,Aemon,;0.152962962963;9870;312
" He is ! ";Arya;Lady,Lord,Sansa,Stark,Father,Mordane,;0.0;9871;312
Sansa insisted . " I do n't want someone brave and gentle , I want him . We 'll be ever so happy , just like in the songs , you 'll see . I 'll give him a son with golden hair , and one day he 'll be the king of all the realm , the greatest king that ever was , as brave as the wolf and as proud as the lion . ";Sansa;Lady,Lord,Arya,Stark,Father,Mordane,;0.671428571429;9872;312
Arya made a face . " Not if Joffrey 's his father , " she said . " He 's a liar and a craven and anyhow he 's a stag , not a lion . ";Arya;Lady,Lord,Sansa,Stark,Father,Mordane,;0.0;9873;312
Sansa felt tears in her eyes . " He is not ! He 's not the least bit like that old drunken king , " she screamed at her sister , forgetting herself in her grief .;Sansa;Lady,Lord,Arya,Stark,Father,Mordane,;-0.333333333333;9874;312
Father looked at her strangely . " Gods , " he swore softly , " out of the mouth of babes ... ";Father;Lady,Lord,Sansa,Arya,Stark,Mordane,;0.0;9875;312
To the girls he said , " I am looking for a fast trading galley to take you home . These days , the sea is safer than the kingsroad . You will sail as soon as I can find a proper ship , with Septa Mordane and a complement of guards ... and yes , with Syrio Forel , if he agrees to enter my service . But say nothing of this . It 's better if no one knows of our plans . We 'll talk again tomorrow . ";Sansa;Lady,Lord,Arya,Stark,Father,Mordane,;0.233333333333;9877;312
" Stop that weeping , child , " Septa Mordane said sternly . " I am certain your lord father knows what is best for you . ";Mordane;Lady,Lord,Sansa,Arya,Stark,Father,;0.607142857143;9881;312
" It wo n't be so bad , Sansa , " Arya said . " We 're going to sail on a galley . It will be an adventure , and then we 'll be with Bran and Robb again , and Old Nan and Hodor and the rest . ";Arya;Lady,Lord,Sansa,Stark,Father,Mordane,;-0.258333333333;9882;312
" Hodor ! ";Father;Lady,Lord,Sansa,Arya,Stark,Mordane,;0.0;9884;312
Sansa yelled . " You ought to marry Hodor , you 're just like him , stupid and hairy and ugly ! ";Sansa;Hodor,;-0.9375;9885;312
" Pain is a gift from the gods , Lord Eddard , " Grand Maester Pycelle told him . " It means the bone is knitting , the flesh healing itself . Be thankful . ";Maester;Pycelle,Ned,Lannister,;0.5;9890;313
" I will be thankful when my leg stops throbbing . ";Ned;Maester,Pycelle,Lannister,;0.0;9891;313
Pycelle set a stoppered flask on the table by the bed . " The milk of the poppy , for when the pain grows too onerous . ";Pycelle;Maester,Ned,Lannister,;0.0;9892;313
" I sleep too much already . ";Ned;Maester,Pycelle,Lannister,;0.1;9893;313
" Sleep is the great healer . ";Pycelle;Maester,Ned,Lannister,;0.8;9894;313
" I had hoped that was you . ";Ned;Maester,Pycelle,Lannister,;0.0;9895;313
Pycelle smiled wanly . " It is good to see you in such a fierce humor , my lord . ";Pycelle;Maester,Ned,Lannister,;0.416666666667;9896;313
He leaned close and lowered his voice . " There was a raven this morning , a letter for the queen from her lord father . I thought you had best know . ";Maester;Pycelle,Ned,Lannister,;1.0;9897;313
" Dark wings , dark words , " Ned said grimly . " What of it ? ";Ned;Maester,Pycelle,Lannister,;-0.15;9898;313
" Lord Tywin is greatly wroth about the men you sent after Ser Gregor Clegane , " the maester confided . " I feared he would be . You will recall , I said as much in council . ";Pycelle;Lord,;0.1;9899;313
" Let him be wroth , " Ned said .;Ned;Maester,Pycelle,Lannister,;0.0;9900;313
Every time his leg throbbed , he remembered Jaime Lannister 's smile , and Jory dead in his arms . " Let him write all the letters to the queen he likes . Lord Beric rides beneath the king 's own banner . If Lord Tywin attempts to interfere with the king 's justice , he will have Robert to answer to . The only thing His Grace enjoys more than hunting is making war on lords who defy him . ";Lannister;Grace,Robert,;0.24;9901;313
Pycelle pulled back , his maester 's chain jangling . " As you say . I shall visit again on the morrow . ";Pycelle;Maester,Ned,Lannister,;0.0;9902;313
Littlefinger came calling an hour after the Grand Maester had left , clad in a plum-colored doublet with a mockingbird embroidered on the breast in black thread , and a striped cloak of black and white . " I cannot visit long , my lord , " he announced . " Lady Tanda expects me to lunch with her . No doubt she will roast me a fatted calf . If it 's near as fatted as her daughter , I 'm like to rupture and die . And how is your leg ? ";Littlefinger;Lady,;0.0309523809524;9919;314
" Inflamed and painful , with an itch that is driving me mad . ";Lord;Littlefinger,Ned,;-0.6625;9920;314
Littlefinger lifted an eyebrow . " In future , try not to let any horses fall on it . I would urge you to heal quickly . The realm grows restive . Varys has heard ominous whispers from the west . Freeriders and sellswords have been flocking to Casterly Rock , and not for the thin pleasure of Lord Tywin 's conversation . ";Littlefinger;Varys,;-0.2;9921;314
" Is there word of the king ? ";Lord;Littlefinger,Ned,;0.0;9922;314
Ned demanded . " Just how long does Robert intend to hunt ? ";Ned;Robert,;-0.05;9923;314
" Given his preferences , I believe he'd stay in the forest until you and the queen both die of old age , " Lord Petyr replied with a faint smile . " Lacking that , I imagine he 'll return as soon as he 's killed something . They found the white hart , it seems ... or rather , what remained of it . Some wolves found it first , and left His Grace scarcely more than a hoof and a horn . Robert was in a fury , until he heard talk of some monstrous boar deeper in the forest . Then nothing would do but he must have it . Prince Joffrey returned this morning , with the Royces , Ser Balon Swann , and some twenty others of the party . The rest are still with the king . ";Lord;Robert,Joffrey,Grace,;0.0928571428571;9924;314
" The Hound ? ";Littlefinger;Ned,Lord,;0.0;9925;314
" Oh , returned with Joffrey , and went straight to the queen . ";Lord;Littlefinger,Ned,;0.2;9928;314
Littlefinger smiled . " I would have given a hundred silver stags to have been a roach in the rushes when he learned that Lord Beric was off to behead his brother . ";Littlefinger;Lord,;0.6;9929;314
" Even a blind man could see the Hound loathed his brother . ";Lord;Hound,;-0.5;9930;314
" Ah , but Gregor was his to loathe , not yours to kill . Once Dondarrion lops the summit off our Mountain , the Clegane lands and incomes will pass to Sandor , but I would n't hold my water waiting for his thanks , not that one . And now you must forgive me . Lady Tanda awaits with her fatted calves . ";Littlefinger;Gregor,Lady,;0.2;9931;314
On the way to the door , Lord Petyr spied Grand Maester Malleon 's massive tome on the table and paused to idly flip open the cover . " The Lineages and Histories of the Great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms , With Descriptions of Many High Lords and Noble Ladies and Their Children , " he read . " Now there is tedious reading if ever I saw it . A sleeping potion , my lord ? ";Lord;Littlefinger,Ned,;0.2575;9932;314
The man was too clever by half , a mocking smile never far from his lips . " Jon Arryn was studying this volume when he was taken sick , " Ned said in a careful tone , to see how he might respond .;Ned;Jon,;-0.0690476190476;9934;314
And he responded as he always did : with a quip . " In that case , " he said , " death must have come as a blessed relief . ";Littlefinger;Ned,Lord,;0.0;9935;314
" I shall require your help , " Ned said when Tomard appeared , looking faintly apprehensive , as he always did when called before his lord . " Take me to the godswood . ";Ned;Tom,House,;0.0;9973;315
" Is that wise , Lord Eddard ? With your leg and all ? ";Tom;Ned,House,;0.7;9974;315
" Perhaps not . But necessary . ";House;Ned,Tom,;0.0;9975;315
With one arm around each man 's shoulders , Ned managed to descend the steep tower steps and hobble across the bailey . " I want the guard doubled , " he told Fat Tom . " No one enters or leaves the Tower of the Hand without my leave . ";Ned;Tower,;0.0;9977;315
Tom blinked . " M'lord , with Alyn and the others away , we are hard-pressed already - ";Tom;Ned,House,;0.0;9978;315
" It will only be a short while . Lengthen the watches . ";Ned;Tom,House,;0.0;9979;315
" As you say , m'lord , " Tom answered . " Might I ask why - ";Tom;Ned,House,;0.0;9980;315
" Best not , " Ned answered crisply .;Ned;Tom,House,;1.0;9981;315
Ned 's leg was screaming as they lowered him to the grass beside the heart tree . " Thank you . ";Ned;Tom,House,;0.0;9983;315
He drew a paper from his sleeve , sealed with the sigil of his House . " Kindly deliver this at once . ";House;Ned,Tom,;0.0;9984;315
Tomard looked at the name Ned had written on the paper and licked his lips anxiously . " My lord ... ";Tom;Ned,House,;0.0;9985;315
" Do as I bid you , Tom , " Ned said .;Ned;Tom,House,;0.0;9986;315
" Why here ? ";Lannister;Ned,Cersei,Jon,;0.0;9997;316
" So the gods can see . ";Cersei;Lannister,Ned,Jon,;0.0;9999;316
It had been a long time since Ned Stark had seen her beauty , but he saw it now . " I know the truth Jon Arryn died for , " he told her .;Ned;Jon,;-0.125;10003;316
" Do you ? ";Cersei;Lannister,Ned,Jon,;0.0;10004;316
The queen watched his face , wary as a cat . " Is that why you called me here , Lord Stark ? To pose me riddles ? Or is it your intent to seize me , as your wife seized my brother ? ";Ned;Lannister,Cersei,Jon,;-0.35;10005;316
" If you truly believed that , you would never have come . ";Cersei;Lannister,Ned,Jon,;0.0;10006;316
Ned touched her cheek gently . " Has he done this before ? ";Ned;Lannister,Cersei,Jon,;0.0;10007;316
" Once or twice . ";Cersei;Lannister,Ned,Jon,;0.0;10008;316
She shied away from his hand . " Never on the face before . Jaime would have killed him , even if it meant his own life . ";Ned;Jaime,;0.6;10009;316
Cersei looked at him defiantly . " My brother is worth a hundred of your friend . ";Cersei;Lannister,Ned,Jon,;0.3;10010;316
" Your brother ? ";Lannister;Ned,Cersei,Jon,;0.0;10011;316
Ned said . " Or your lover ? ";Ned;Lannister,Cersei,Jon,;0.0;10012;316
" Both . ";Cersei;Lannister,Ned,Jon,;0.0;10013;316
She did not flinch from the truth . " Since we were children together . And why not ? The Targaryens wed brother to sister for three hundred years , to keep the bloodlines pure . And Jaime and I are more than brother and sister . We are one person in two bodies . We shared a womb together . He came into this world holding my foot , our old maester said . When he is in me , I feel ... whole . ";Ned;Targaryen,;0.253571428571;10014;316
" My son Bran ... ";Lannister;Ned,Cersei,Jon,;0.0;10016;316
To her credit , Cersei did not look away . " He saw us . You love your children , do you not ? ";Cersei;Lannister,Ned,Jon,;0.5;10017;316
He gave her the same answer . " With all my heart . ";Lannister;Ned,Cersei,Jon,;0.0;10019;316
" No less do I love mine . ";Ned;Lannister,Cersei,Jon,;0.166666666667;10020;316
" All three are Jaime ' s , " he said .;Cersei;Jaime,;0.0;10025;316
" Thank the gods . ";Jon;Lannister,Ned,Cersei,;0.0;10027;316
" A dozen years , " Ned said . " How is it that you have had no children by the king ? ";Ned;Cersei,;0.0;10035;317
She lifted her head , defiant . " Your Robert got me with child once , " she said , her voice thick with contempt . " My brother found a woman to cleanse me . He never knew . If truth be told , I can scarcely bear for him to touch me , and I have not let him inside me for years . I know other ways to pleasure him , when he leaves his whores long enough to stagger up to my bedchamber . Whatever we do , the king is usually so drunk that he 's forgotten it all by the next morning . ";Ned;Robert,;-0.1625;10036;317
Ned felt sick . " I remember Robert as he was the day he took the throne , every inch a king , " he said quietly . " A thousand other women might have loved him with all their hearts . What did he do to make you hate him so ? ";Ned;Robert,;-0.234821428571;10039;317
Her eyes burned , green fire in the dusk , like the lioness that was her sigil . " The night of our wedding feast , the first time we shared a bed , he called me by your sister 's name . He was on top of me , in me , stinking of wine , and he whispered Lyanna . ";Ned;Lyanna,;0.183333333333;10040;317
Ned Stark thought of pale blue roses , and for a moment he wanted to weep . " I do not know which of you I pity most . ";Ned;Cersei,;0.1;10041;317
The queen seemed amused by that . " Save your pity for yourself , Lord Stark . I want none of it . ";Ned;Cersei,;-0.2;10042;317
" You know what I must do . ";Ned;Cersei,;0.0;10043;317
" Must ! ";Ned;Cersei,;0.0;10044;317
She put her hand on his good leg , just above the knee . " A true man does what he will , not what he must . ";Ned;Cersei,;0.333333333333;10045;317
Her fingers brushed lightly against his thigh , the gentlest of promises . " The realm needs a strong Hand . Joff will not come of age for years . No one wants war again , least of all me . ";Ned;Joffrey,;0.0833333333333;10046;317
Her hand touched his face , his hair . " If friends can turn to enemies , enemies can become friends . Your wife is a thousand leagues away , and my brother has fled . Be kind to me , Ned . I swear to you , you shall never regret it . ";Ned;Cersei,;0.6;10047;317
" Did you make the same offer to Jon Arryn ? ";Ned;Cersei,;0.0;10048;317
" I shall wear that as a badge of honor , " Ned said dryly .;Ned;Cersei,;0.0;10050;317
" Honor , " she spat . " How dare you play the noble lord with me ! What do you take me for ? You 've a bastard of your own , I 've seen him . Who was the mother , I wonder ? Some Dornish peasant you raped while her holdfast burned ? A whore ? Or was it the grieving sister , the Lady Ashara ? She threw herself into the sea , I 'm told . Why was that ? For the brother you slew , or the child you stole ? Tell me , my honorable Lord Eddard , how are you any different from Robert , or me , or Jaime ? ";Ned;Cersei,;0.45;10051;317
" For a start , " said Ned , " I do not kill children . You would do well to listen , my lady . I shall say this only once . When the king returns from his hunt , I intend to lay the truth before him . You must be gone by then . You and your children , all three , and not to Casterly Rock . If I were you , I should take ship for the Free Cities , or even farther , to the Summer Isles or the Port of Ibben . As far as the winds blow . ";Ned;Cersei,;0.166666666667;10052;317
" Exile , " she said . " A bitter cup to drink from . ";Ned;Cersei,;-0.1;10053;317
" A sweeter cup than your father served Rhaegar 's children , " Ned said , " and kinder than you deserve . Your father and your brothers would do well to go with you . Lord Tywin 's gold will buy you comfort and hire swords to keep you safe . You shall need them . I promise you , no matter where you flee , Robert 's wrath will follow you , to the back of beyond if need be . ";Ned;Rhaegar,;0.25;10054;317
The queen stood . " And what of my wrath , Lord Stark ? ";Ned;Cersei,;-0.2;10055;317
Her eyes searched his face . " You should have taken the realm for yourself . It was there for the taking . Jaime told me how you found him on the Iron Throne the day King 's Landing fell , and made him yield it up . That was your moment . All you needed to do was climb those steps , and sit . Such a sad mistake . ";Ned;Jaime,Iron,;-0.25;10057;317
" I have made more mistakes than you can possibly imagine , " Ned said , " but that was not one of them . ";Ned;Cersei,;0.5;10058;317
" Oh , but it was , my lord , " Cersei insisted . " When you play the game of thrones , you win or you die . There is no middle ground . ";Cersei;Ned,;0.133333333333;10059;317
" Khalakka dothrae mr'anha ! ";Dothraki;;0.0;10093;318
The oldest of the crones , a bent and shriveled stick of a woman with a single black eye , raised her arms on high . " Khalakka dothrae ! ";Dothraki;;-0.0325396825397;10097;318
" He is riding ! ";Dothraki;;0.0;10100;318
the other women answered . " Rakh ! Rakh ! Rakh haj ! ";Dothraki;;-0.244140625;10101;318
Finally the crone opened her eye and lifted her arms . " I have seen his face , and heard the thunder of his hooves , " she proclaimed in a thin , wavery voice .;Drogo;Dany,Jhiqui,Dothraki,;-0.4;10118;319
" The thunder of his hooves ! ";Dany;Drogo,Jhiqui,Dothraki,;0.0;10119;319
" As swift as the wind he rides , and behind him his khalasar covers the earth , men without number , with arakhs shining in their hands like blades of razor grass . Fierce as a storm this prince will be . His enemies will tremble before him , and their wives will weep tears of blood and rend their flesh in grief . The bells in his hair will sing his coming , and the milk men in the stone tents will fear his name . ";Jhiqui;earth,;-0.6;10121;319
The old woman trembled and looked at Dany almost as if she were afraid . " The prince is riding , and he shall be the stallion who mounts the world . ";Dany;Drogo,Jhiqui,Dothraki,;-0.25;10122;319
" The stallion who mounts the world ! ";Jhiqui;Drogo,Dany,Dothraki,;0.0;10123;319
The one-eyed crone peered at Dany . " What shall he be called , the stallion who mounts the world ? ";Dany;Drogo,Jhiqui,Dothraki,;0.0;10125;319
She stood to answer . " He shall be called Rhaego , " she said , using the words that Jhiqui had taught her .;Jhiqui;Rhaego,;0.0;10126;319
Her hands touched the swell beneath her breasts protectively as a roar went up from the Dothraki . " Rhaego , " they screamed . " Rhaego , Rhaego , Rhaego ! ";Dothraki;Drogo,Dany,Jhiqui,;0.0;10127;319
" What is meaning , name Rhaego ? ";Drogo;;0.0;10141;320
" My brother Rhaegar was a fierce warrior , my sun-and-stars , " she told him . " He died before I was born . Ser Jorah says that he was the last of the dragons . ";Drogo;Rhaegar,Jorah,;0.0;10145;320
His face was a copper mask , yet under the long black mustache , drooping beneath the weight of its gold rings , she thought she glimpsed the shadow of a smile . " Is good name , Dan Ares wife , moon of my life , " he said .;Drogo;;0.183333333333;10147;320
Three quick strokes and it was done . " The stallion who mounts the world , " Drogo whispered hoarsely .;Drogo;;0.333333333333;10164;321
She could not understand all they shouted , but one phrase came clear . " The stallion that mounts the world , " she heard , bellowed in a thousand voices .;Dothraki;;0.1;10178;322
Mormont came at once , and went to one knee before her . " Khaleesi , " he said , " I am yours to command . ";Mormont;Jorah,Dany,Landing,moment,Doreah,;0.0;10192;323
She patted the stuffed horsehide cushion beside her . " Sit and talk with me . ";Dany;Mormont,Jorah,Landing,moment,Doreah,;0.0;10193;323

" I saw His Grace this morning , " he told her . " He told me he was going to the Western Market , in search of wine . ";Jorah;Mormont,Dany,Landing,moment,Doreah,;0.0;10200;323
" Wine ? ";Dany;Mormont,Jorah,Landing,moment,Doreah,;0.0;10201;323
" Wine , " Ser Jorah confirmed , " and he has some thought to recruit men for his army from the sellswords who guard the caravans . ";Jorah;Mormont,Dany,Landing,moment,Doreah,;0.4;10205;323
" Is that wise ? ";Dany;Mormont,Jorah,Landing,moment,Doreah,;0.7;10207;323
she asked . " He has no gold to pay soldiers . What if he 's betrayed ? ";Jorah;Mormont,Dany,Landing,moment,Doreah,;0.0;10208;323
Caravan guards were seldom troubled much by thoughts of honor , and the Usurper in King 's Landing would pay well for her brother 's head . " You ought to have gone with him , to keep him safe . You are his sworn sword . ";Landing;Mormont,Jorah,Dany,moment,Doreah,;0.0333333333333;10209;323
" We are in Vaes Dothrak , " he reminded her . " No one may carry a blade here or shed a man 's blood . ";Jorah;Mormont,Dany,Landing,moment,Doreah,;0.0;10210;323
" Yet men die , " she said . " Jhogo told me . Some of the traders have eunuchs with them , huge men who strangle thieves with wisps of silk . That way no blood is shed and the gods are not angered . ";Dany;Jhogo,;-0.175;10211;323
" Then let us hope your brother will be wise enough not to steal anything . ";Doreah;Mormont,Jorah,Dany,Landing,moment,;0.35;10212;323
Ser Jorah wiped the grease off his mouth with the back of his hand and leaned close over the table . " He had planned to take your dragon 's eggs , until I warned him that I'd cut off his hand if he so much as touched them . ";Jorah;Mormont,Dany,Landing,moment,Doreah,;0.05;10213;323
For a moment Dany was so shocked she had no words . " My eggs ... but they 're mine , Magister Illyrio gave them to me , a bride gift , why would Viserys want ... they 're only stones ... ";moment;Illyrio,Viserys,;-0.35;10214;323
" The same could be said of rubies and diamonds and fire opals , Princess ... and dragon 's eggs are rarer by far . Those traders he 's been drinking with would sell their own manhoods for even one of those stones , and with all three Viserys could buy as many sellswords as he might need . ";Jorah;Viserys,;0.3;10215;323
Dany had not known , had not even suspected . " Then ... he should have them . He does not need to steal them . He had only to ask . He is my brother ... and my true king . ";Dany;Mormont,Jorah,Landing,moment,Doreah,;0.175;10216;323
" He is your brother , " Ser Jorah acknowledged .;Jorah;Mormont,Dany,Landing,moment,Doreah,;0.0;10217;323
" You do not understand , ser , " she said . " My mother died giving me birth , and my father and my brother Rhaegar even before that . I would never have known so much as their names if Viserys had not been there to tell me . He was the only one left . The only one . He is all I have . ";Dany;Viserys,;0.025;10218;323
" Once , " said Ser Jorah . " No longer , Khaleesi . You belong to the Dothraki now . In your womb rides the stallion who mounts the world . ";Jorah;Mormont,Dany,Landing,moment,Doreah,;0.0;10219;323
Even the smell of it made her feel ill , and she would take no chances of bringing up the horse heart she had forced herself to eat . " What does it mean ? ";Dany;Mormont,Jorah,Landing,moment,Doreah,;-0.370833333333;10222;323
she asked . " What is this stallion ? Everyone was shouting it at me , but I do n't understand . ";Jorah;Mormont,Dany,Landing,moment,Doreah,;0.0;10223;323
" The stallion is the khal of khals promised in ancient prophecy , child . He will unite the Dothraki into a single khalasar and ride to the ends of the earth , or so it was promised . All the people of the world will be his herd . ";Doreah;khal,;-0.0714285714286;10224;323
" Oh , " Dany said in a small voice .;Dany;Mormont,Jorah,Landing,moment,Doreah,;-0.25;10225;323
Her hand smoothed her robe down over the swell of her stomach . " I named him Rhaego . ";Jorah;Rhaego,;-0.155555555556;10226;323
" A name to make the Usurper 's blood run cold . ";Dany;Usurper,;-0.6;10227;323
Suddenly Doreah was tugging at her elbow . " My lady , " the handmaid whispered urgently , " your brother ... ";Doreah;Mormont,Jorah,Dany,Landing,moment,;0.0;10228;323
A sense of dread closed around her heart . " Go to him , " she commanded Ser Jorah . " Stop him . Bring him here . Tell him he can have the dragon 's eggs if that is what he wants . ";Jorah;Viserys,Drogo,;0.05;10238;324
" Where is my sister ? ";Drogo;Jorah,Viserys,;0.0;10240;324
Viserys shouted , his voice thick with wine . " I 've come for her feast . How dare you presume to eat without me ? No one eats before the king . Where is she ? The whore ca n't hide from the dragon . ";Viserys;Jorah,Drogo,;-0.3;10241;324
Ser Jorah went to him swiftly , whispered something in his ear , and took him by the arm , but Viserys wrenched free . " Keep your hands off me ! No one touches the dragon without leave . ";Viserys;Jorah,Drogo,;0.5;10245;324
The sound of laughter made Viserys lift his eyes . " Khal Drogo , " he said thickly , his voice almost polite . " I 'm here for the feast . ";Viserys;Jorah,Drogo,;0.4;10249;324
Khal Drogo rose , spat out a dozen words in Dothraki , faster than Dany could understand , and pointed . " Khal Drogo says your place is not on the high bench , " Ser Jorah translated for her brother . " Khal Drogo says your place is there . ";Drogo;Drogo,;0.38;10251;324
Far from the meat , and farther from honor . " That is no place for a king , " her brother declared .;Viserys;Jorah,Drogo,;0.1;10254;324
" Is place , " Khal Drogo answered , in the Common Tongue that Dany had taught him , " for Sorefoot King . ";Drogo;Jorah,Viserys,;-0.3;10255;324
He clapped his hands together . " A cart ! Bring cart for Khal Rhaggat ! ";Jorah;Viserys,Drogo,;0.0;10256;324
The bared steel shone a fearful red in the glare from the firepits . " Keep away from me ! ";Viserys;Jorah,Drogo,;-0.5625;10261;324
Her voice made Viserys turn his head , and he saw her for the first time . " There she is , " he said , smiling .;Viserys;Jorah,Daenerys,;0.25;10268;325
" The blade ... you must not , " she begged him . " Please , Viserys . It is forbidden . Put down the sword and come share my cushions . There 's drink , food ... is it the dragon 's eggs you want ? You can have them , only throw away the sword . ";Daenerys;Viserys,Jorah,;-0.0777777777778;10270;325
" Do as she tells you , fool , " Ser Jorah shouted , " before you get us all killed . ";Jorah;Viserys,Daenerys,;0.0;10271;325
Viserys laughed . " They ca n't kill us . They ca n't shed blood here in the sacred city ... but I can . ";Viserys;Jorah,Daenerys,;0.7;10272;325
He laid the point of his sword between Daenerys 's breasts and slid it downward , over the curve of her belly . " I want what I came for , " he told her . " I want the crown he promised me . He bought you , but he never paid for you . Tell him I want what I bargained for , or I 'm taking you back . You and the eggs both . He can keep his bloody foal . I 'll cut the bastard out and leave it for him . ";Daenerys;Viserys,Jorah,;-0.4;10273;325
She put her arm around the girl . " Do n't be afraid , " she said . " I shall tell him . ";Viserys;Jorah,Daenerys,;-0.6;10277;325
The sun of her life stepped down from the high bench . " What did he say ? ";Jorah;Viserys,Daenerys,;0.00222222222222;10279;325
Daenerys had gone cold all over . " He says you shall have a splendid golden crown that men shall tremble to behold . ";Daenerys;Viserys,Jorah,;0.177777777778;10283;325
the way he smiled . " That was all I wanted , " he said . " What was promised . ";Jorah;Viserys,Daenerys,;0.6;10286;325
Even now Viserys did not understand . " No , " he shouted , " you cannot touch me , I am the dragon , the dragon , and I will be crowned ! ";Viserys;Jorah,Daenerys,;0.0;10292;325
He put a hand on her shoulder . " Turn away , my princess , I beg you . ";Jorah;Viserys,Drogo,;0.0;10303;326
" No . ";Drogo;Jorah,Viserys,;0.0;10304;326
At the last , Viserys looked at her . " Sister , please ... Dany , tell them ... make them ... sweet sister ... ";Viserys;Jorah,Drogo,;0.175;10306;326
When the gold was half-melted and starting to run , Drogo reached into the flames , snatched out the pot . " Crown ! ";Drogo;Jorah,Viserys,;0.0;10307;326
he roared . " Here . A crown for Cart King ! ";Jorah;Viserys,Drogo,;0.0;10308;326
Last of all , he came to the tomb where his father slept , with Brandon and Lyanna beside him . " Promise me , Ned , " Lyanna 's statue whispered .;Bran;Tom,Ned,;0.0;10321;327
The room was black as pitch , and someone was hammering on the door . " Lord Eddard , " a voice called loudly .;Ned;Bran,Tom,;-0.166666666667;10324;327
" A moment . ";Tom;Bran,Ned,;0.0;10325;327
The man 's face might have been carved of stone , so little did it show . " My lord Hand , " he intoned . " His Grace the King commands your presence . At once . ";Bran;Tom,Ned,;-0.1875;10329;327
It was long past time . " I shall need a few moments to dress . ";Ned;Bran,Tom,;-0.166666666667;10331;327
The royal steward opened the door . " Lord Eddard Stark , the Hand of the King , " he announced .;Robert;;-0.2;10344;328
" Bring him here , " Robert 's voice called , strangely thick .;Robert;;-0.3;10345;328
" Ned , " the king whispered when he saw him .;Ned;Robert,Lord,Renly,;0.0;10359;329
His face was pale as milk . " Come ... closer . ";Lord;Ned,Robert,Renly,;0.0;10360;329
He had only to look down at Robert to know how bad it was . " What ... ? ";Robert;Ned,Lord,Renly,;-0.257407407407;10363;329
" A boar . ";Ned;Robert,Lord,Renly,;0.0;10365;329
" A devil , " the king husked . " My own fault . Too much wine , damn me to hell . Missed my thrust . ";Lord;Ned,Robert,Renly,;0.35;10367;329
" And where were the rest of you ? ";Robert;Ned,Lord,Renly,;0.0;10368;329
Ned demanded of Lord Renly . " Where was Ser Barristan and the Kingsguard ? ";Ned;King,;0.0;10369;329
Renly 's mouth twitched . " My brother commanded us to stand aside and let him take the boar alone . ";Renly;Ned,Robert,Lord,;0.0;10370;329
" Stinks , " Robert said . " The stink of death , do n't think I ca n't smell it . Bastard did me good , eh ? But I ... I paid him back in kind , Ned . ";Robert;Lord,Maester,Ned,Gendry,Barristan,Serrett,Varys,Tom,Renly,;0.416666666667;10378;330
The king 's smile was as terrible as his wound , his teeth red . " Drove a knife right through his eye . Ask them if I did n't . Ask them . ";Ned;Robert,Lord,Maester,Gendry,Barristan,Serrett,Varys,Tom,Renly,;-0.103571428571;10379;330
" Truly , " Lord Renly murmured . " We brought the carcass back with us , at my brother 's command . ";Lord;Robert,Maester,Ned,Gendry,Barristan,Serrett,Varys,Tom,Renly,;0.0;10380;330
" For the feast , " Robert whispered . " Now leave us . The lot of you . I need to speak with Ned . ";Robert;Lord,Maester,Ned,Gendry,Barristan,Serrett,Varys,Tom,Renly,;0.0;10381;330
" Robert , my sweet lord ... ";Ned;Robert,Lord,Maester,Gendry,Barristan,Serrett,Varys,Tom,Renly,;0.35;10382;330
" I said leave , " Robert insisted with a hint of his old fierceness . " What part of that do n't you understand , woman ? ";Robert;Lord,Maester,Ned,Gendry,Barristan,Serrett,Varys,Tom,Renly,;0.1;10384;330
Grand Maester Pycelle lingered , his hands shaking as he offered the king a cup of thick white liquid . " The milk of the poppy , Your Grace , " he said . " Drink . For your pain . ";Maester;Robert,Lord,Ned,Gendry,Barristan,Serrett,Varys,Tom,Renly,;0.0666666666667;10387;330
Robert knocked the cup away with the back of his hand . " Away with you . I 'll sleep soon enough , old fool . Get out . ";Robert;Lord,Maester,Ned,Gendry,Barristan,Serrett,Varys,Tom,Renly,;0.0333333333333;10388;330
" Damn you , Robert , " Ned said when they were alone .;Ned;Robert,Lord,Maester,Gendry,Barristan,Serrett,Varys,Tom,Renly,;0.0;10390;330
He lowered himself to the bed , beside his friend . " Why do you always have to be so headstrong ? ";Robert;Lord,Maester,Ned,Gendry,Barristan,Serrett,Varys,Tom,Renly,;0.0;10393;330
" Ah , fuck you , Ned , " the king said hoarsely . " I killed the bastard , did n't I ? ";Lord;Robert,Maester,Ned,Gendry,Barristan,Serrett,Varys,Tom,Renly,;-0.4;10394;330
A lock of matted black hair fell across his eyes as he glared up at Ned . " Ought to do the same for you . Ca n't leave a man to hunt in peace . Ser Robar found me . Gregor 's head . Ugly thought . Never told the Hound . Let Cersei surprise him . ";Ned;Robar,Hound,;-0.288888888889;10395;330
His laugh turned into a grunt as a spasm of pain hit him . " Gods have mercy , " he muttered , swallowing his agony . " The girl . Daenerys . Only a child , you were right ... that 's why , the girl ... the gods sent the boar ... sent to punish me ... ";Robert;Gods,;0.195238095238;10396;330
The king coughed , bringing up blood . " Wrong , it was wrong , I ... only a girl ... Varys , Littlefinger , even my brother ... worthless ... no one to tell me no but you , Ned ... only you ... ";Ned;Robert,Lord,Maester,Gendry,Barristan,Serrett,Varys,Tom,Renly,;-0.36;10397;330
He lifted his hand , the gesture pained and feeble . " Paper and ink . There , on the table . Write what I tell you . ";Robert;Lord,Maester,Ned,Gendry,Barristan,Serrett,Varys,Tom,Renly,;-0.5;10398;330
Ned smoothed the paper out across his knee and took up the quill . " At your command , Your Grace . ";Ned;Robert,Lord,Maester,Gendry,Barristan,Serrett,Varys,Tom,Renly,;0.0;10399;330
" This is the will and word of Robert of House Baratheon , the First of his Name , King of the Andals and all the rest-put in the damn titles , you know how it goes .

" Robert ... ";Lord;Robert,Maester,Ned,Gendry,Barristan,Serrett,Varys,Tom,Renly,;0.0;10401;330
So Ned bent his head and wrote , but where the king had said " my son Joffrey , " he scrawled " my heir " instead .;Ned;Robert,Lord,Maester,Gendry,Barristan,Serrett,Varys,Tom,Renly,;0.0;10404;330
May the gods forgive me . " What else would you have me say ? ";Robert;Lord,Maester,Ned,Gendry,Barristan,Serrett,Varys,Tom,Renly,;0.0;10407;330
" Say ... whatever you need to . Protect and defend , gods old and new , you have the words . Write . I 'll sign it . You give it to the council when I 'm dead . ";Lord;Robert,Maester,Ned,Gendry,Barristan,Serrett,Varys,Tom,Renly,;0.0121212121212;10408;330

Robert took his hand , fingers squeezing hard . " You are ... such a bad liar , Ned Stark , " he said through his pain . " The realm ... the realm knows ... what a wretched king I 've been . Bad as Aerys , the gods spare me . ";Robert;Lord,Maester,Ned,Gendry,Barristan,Serrett,Varys,Tom,Renly,;-0.345;10410;330
" No , " Ned told his dying friend , " not so bad as Aerys , Your Grace . Not near so bad as Aerys . ";Ned;Robert,Lord,Maester,Gendry,Barristan,Serrett,Varys,Tom,Renly,;-0.377777777778;10411;330
Robert managed a weak red smile . " At the least , they will say ... this last thing ... this I did right . You wo n't fail me . You 'll rule now . You 'll hate it , worse than I did ... but you 'll do well . Are you done with the scribbling ? ";Robert;Lord,Maester,Ned,Gendry,Barristan,Serrett,Varys,Tom,Renly,;-0.19880952381;10412;330
" Yes , Your Grace . ";Ned;Robert,Lord,Maester,Gendry,Barristan,Serrett,Varys,Tom,Renly,;0.0;10413;330
The king scrawled his signature blindly , leaving a smear of blood across the letter . " The seal should be witnessed . ";Lord;Robert,Maester,Ned,Gendry,Barristan,Serrett,Varys,Tom,Renly,;0.0;10415;330
" Serve the boar at my funeral feast , " Robert rasped . " Apple in its mouth , skin seared crisp . Eat the bastard . Do n't care if you choke on him . Promise me , Ned . ";Robert;Lord,Maester,Ned,Gendry,Barristan,Serrett,Varys,Tom,Renly,;0.25;10416;330

" The girl , " the king said . " Daenerys . Let her live . If you can , if it ... not too late ... talk to them ... Varys , Littlefinger ... do n't let them kill her . And help my son , Ned .

He winced . " Gods have mercy . ";Robert;Gods,;0.0;10420;330
" They will , my friend , " Ned said . " They will . ";Ned;Robert,Lord,Maester,Gendry,Barristan,Serrett,Varys,Tom,Renly,;0.0;10421;330
The king closed his eyes and seemed to relax . " Killed by a pig , " he muttered . " Ought to laugh , but it hurts too much . ";Robert;Lord,Maester,Ned,Gendry,Barristan,Serrett,Varys,Tom,Renly,;0.1;10422;330
Ned was not laughing . " Shall I call them back ? ";Ned;Robert,Lord,Maester,Gendry,Barristan,Serrett,Varys,Tom,Renly,;0.0;10423;330
Robert gave a weak nod . " As you will . Gods , why is it so cold in here ? ";Robert;Lord,Maester,Ned,Gendry,Barristan,Serrett,Varys,Tom,Renly,;-0.4875;10424;330
He bid his brother Renly and Grand Maester Pycelle to stand in witness as he pressed his seal into the hot yellow wax that Ned had dripped upon his letter . " Now give me something for the pain and let me die . ";Ned;Robert,Lord,Maester,Gendry,Barristan,Serrett,Varys,Tom,Renly,;0.25;10430;330
His black beard was beaded with thick white droplets when he threw the empty cup aside . " Will I dream ? ";Robert;Lord,Maester,Ned,Gendry,Barristan,Serrett,Varys,Tom,Renly,;-0.141666666667;10433;330
Ned gave him his answer . " You will , my lord . ";Ned;Robert,Lord,Maester,Gendry,Barristan,Serrett,Varys,Tom,Renly,;0.0;10434;330
" Good , " he said , smiling . " I will give Lyanna your love , Ned . Take care of my children for me . ";Robert;Lord,Maester,Ned,Gendry,Barristan,Serrett,Varys,Tom,Renly,;0.575;10435;330
Then he remembered the bastards : little Barra at her mother 's breast , Mya in the Vale , Gendry at his forge , and all the others . " I shall ... guard your children as if they were my own , " he said slowly .;Gendry;Robert,Lord,Maester,Ned,Barristan,Serrett,Varys,Tom,Renly,;0.20625;10439;330
Heavy chains jangled softly as Grand Maester Pycelle came up to Ned . " I will do all in my power , my lord , but the wound has mortified . It took them two days to get him back . By the time I saw him , it was too late . I can lessen His Grace 's suffering , but only the gods can heal him now . ";Maester;Grace,;0.0;10443;330

He might have been Robert 's ghost as he stood there , young and dark and handsome . " He slew the boar . His entrails were sliding from his belly , yet somehow he slew the boar . ";Robert;Lord,Maester,Ned,Gendry,Barristan,Serrett,Varys,Tom,Renly,;0.15;10449;330
" Robert was never a man to leave the battleground so long as a foe remained standing , " Ned told him .;Ned;Robert,;-0.05;10451;330
Outside the door , Ser Barristan Selmy still guarded the tower stairs . " Maester Pycelle has given Robert the milk of the poppy , " Ned told him . " See that no one disturbs his rest without leave from me . ";Barristan;Maester,;0.2;10452;330

" Even the truest knight cannot protect a king against himself , " Ned said . " Robert loved to hunt boar . I have seen him take a thousand of them . ";Ned;Robert,;0.7;10455;330
He would stand his ground without flinching , his legs braced , the great spear in his hands , and as often as not he would curse the boar as it charged , and wait until the last possible second , until it was almost on him , before he killed it with a single sure and savage thrust .

" The elder , " said Ser Barristan . " Lancel . ";Serrett;Robert,Lord,Maester,Ned,Gendry,Barristan,Varys,Tom,Renly,;0.0;10470;330
" I know the lad well , " said Varys . " A stalwart boy , Ser Kevan Lannister 's son , nephew to Lord Tywin and cousin to the queen . I hope the dear sweet lad does not blame himself . Children are so vulnerable in the innocence of their youth , how well do I remember . ";Varys;Robert,Lord,Maester,Ned,Gendry,Barristan,Serrett,Tom,Renly,;-0.075;10471;330
Ned doubted that he had ever been innocent . " You mention children . Robert had a change of heart concerning Daenerys Targaryen . Whatever arrangements you made , I want unmade . At once . ";Ned;Robert,Targaryen,;0.5;10473;330
" Alas , " said Varys . " At once may be too late . I fear those birds have flown . But I shall do what I can , my lord . With your leave . ";Varys;Robert,Lord,Maester,Ned,Gendry,Barristan,Serrett,Tom,Renly,;-0.35;10474;330
Cayn and Tomard were helping Ned across the bridge when Lord Renly emerged from Maegor 's Holdfast . " Lord Eddard , " he called after Ned , " a moment , if you would be so kind . ";Tom;Robert,Lord,Maester,Ned,Gendry,Barristan,Serrett,Varys,Renly,;0.6;10476;330
Ned stopped . " As you wish . ";Ned;Robert,Lord,Maester,Gendry,Barristan,Serrett,Varys,Tom,Renly,;0.0;10477;330
Renly walked to his side . " Send your men away . ";Renly;Robert,Lord,Maester,Ned,Gendry,Barristan,Serrett,Varys,Tom,;0.0;10478;330
Lord Renly glanced warily at Ser Boros on the far end of the span , at Ser Preston in the doorway behind them . " That letter . ";Lord;Robert,Maester,Ned,Gendry,Barristan,Serrett,Varys,Tom,Renly,;-0.15;10483;330
He leaned close . " Was it the regency ? Has my brother named you Protector ? ";Ned;Robert,Lord,Maester,Gendry,Barristan,Serrett,Varys,Tom,Renly,;0.0;10484;330
He did not wait for a reply . " My lord , I have thirty men in my personal guard , and other friends beside , knights and lords . Give me an hour , and I can put a hundred swords in your hand . ";Robert;Lord,Maester,Ned,Gendry,Barristan,Serrett,Varys,Tom,Renly,;-0.0625;10485;330
" And what should I do with a hundred swords , my lord ? ";Ned;Robert,Lord,Maester,Gendry,Barristan,Serrett,Varys,Tom,Renly,;0.0;10486;330
" Strike ! Now , while the castle sleeps . ";Robert;Lord,Maester,Ned,Gendry,Barristan,Serrett,Varys,Tom,Renly,;0.0;10487;330
Renly looked back at Ser Boros again and dropped his voice to an urgent whisper . " We must get Joffrey away from his mother and take him in hand . Protector or no , the man who holds the king holds the kingdom . We should seize Myrcella and Tommen as well . Once we have her children , Cersei will not dare oppose us . The council will confirm you as Lord Protector and make Joffrey your ward . ";Renly;Cersei,away,Tom,;0.0;10488;330
Ned regarded him coldly . " Robert is not dead yet . The gods may spare him . If not , I shall convene the council to hear his final words and consider the matter of the succession , but I will not dishonor his last hours on earth by shedding blood in his halls and dragging frightened children from their beds . ";Ned;Robert,;-0.0666666666667;10489;330
Lord Renly took a step back , taut as a bowstring . " Every moment you delay gives Cersei another moment to prepare . By the time Robert dies , it may be too late ... for both of us . ";Lord;Robert,;-0.15;10490;330
" Then we should pray that Robert does not die . ";Ned;Robert,;0.0;10491;330
" Small chance of that , " said Renly .;Renly;Robert,Lord,Maester,Ned,Gendry,Barristan,Serrett,Varys,Tom,;-0.25;10492;330
" Sometimes the gods are merciful . ";Ned;Robert,Lord,Maester,Gendry,Barristan,Serrett,Varys,Tom,Renly,;0.0;10493;330
" The Lannisters are not . ";Lord;Lannister,;0.0;10494;330
" I want Littlefinger , " he told Cayn . " If he 's not in his chambers , take as many men as you need and search every winesink and whorehouse in King 's Landing until you find him . Bring him to me before break of day . ";Cayn;Littlefinger,Landing,;0.5;10501;331
Cayn bowed and took his leave , and Ned turned to Tomard . " The Wind Witch sails on the evening tide . Have you chosen the escort ? ";Cayn;Ned,Tom,;0.0;10502;331
" Ten men , with Porther in command . ";Tom;Cayn,Ned,;0.0;10503;331

Tom looked apprehensive . " To Dragonstone , m'lord ? ";Tom;Cayn,Ned,;0.0;10509;331
" Tell Captain Qos to hoist my banner as soon as he comes in sight of the island . They may be wary of unexpected visitors . If he is reluctant , offer him whatever it takes .

Lord Petyr was clad in a blue velvet tunic with puffed sleeves , his silvery cape patterned with mockingbirds . " I suppose congratulations are in order , " he said as he seated himself .;Lord;Ned,Littlefinger,;0.0;10538;332
Ned scowled . " The king lies wounded and near to death . ";Ned;Lord,Littlefinger,;0.1;10539;332
" I know , " Littlefinger said . " I also know that Robert has named you Protector of the Realm . ";Littlefinger;Robert,;0.0;10540;332
Ned 's eyes flicked to the king 's letter on the table beside him , its seal unbroken . " And how is it you know that , my lord ? ";Ned;Lord,Littlefinger,;0.0;10541;332
" Varys hinted as much , " Littlefinger said , " and you have just confirmed it . ";Littlefinger;Varys,;0.25;10542;332
Ned 's mouth twisted in anger . " Damn Varys and his little birds . Catelyn spoke truly , the man has some black art . I do not trust him . ";Ned;Catelyn,;-0.388541666667;10543;332
" Excellent . You 're learning . ";Lord;Ned,Littlefinger,;1.0;10544;332
Littlefinger leaned forward . " Yet I 'll wager you did not drag me here in the black of night to discuss the eunuch . ";Littlefinger;Lord,Ned,;-0.166666666667;10545;332
" No , " Ned admitted . " I know the secret Jon Arryn was murdered to protect . Robert will leave no trueborn son behind him . Joffrey and Tommen are Jaime Lannister 's bastards , born of his incestuous union with the queen . ";Ned;Jon,Joffrey,Lannister,;-0.4;10546;332
Littlefinger lifted an eyebrow . " Shocking , " he said in a tone that suggested he was not shocked at all . " The girl as well ? No doubt . So when the king dies ... ";Littlefinger;Lord,Ned,;-0.85;10547;332
" The throne by rights passes to Lord Stannis , the elder of Robert 's two brothers . ";Ned;Lord,Littlefinger,;0.0;10548;332
Lord Petyr stroked his pointed beard as he considered the matter . " So it would seem . Unless ... ";Lord;Ned,Littlefinger,;0.0;10549;332
" Unless , my lord ? There is no seeming to this . Stannis is the heir . Nothing can change that . ";Littlefinger;Stannis,;0.0;10550;332
" Stannis cannot take the throne without your help . If you 're wise , you 'll make certain Joffrey succeeds . ";Lord;Stannis,Joffrey,;0.538095238095;10551;332
Ned gave him a stony stare . " Have you no shred of honor ? ";Ned;Lord,Littlefinger,;0.0;10552;332
" Oh , a shred , surely , " Littlefinger replied negligently . " Hear me out . Stannis is no friend of yours , nor of mine . Even his brothers can scarcely stomach him . The man is iron , hard and unyielding . He 'll give us a new Hand and a new council , for a certainty . No doubt he 'll thank you for handing him the crown , but he wo n't love you for it . And his ascent will mean war . Stannis cannot rest easy on the throne until Cersei and her bastards are dead . Do you think Lord Tywin will sit idly while his daughter 's head is measured for a spike ? Casterly Rock will rise , and not alone . Robert found it in him to pardon men who served King Aerys , so long as they did him fealty . Stannis is less forgiving . He will not have forgotten the siege of Storm 's End , and the Lords Tyrell and Redwyne dare not . Every man who fought beneath the dragon banner or rose with Balon Greyjoy will have good cause to fear . Seat Stannis on the Iron Throne and I promise you , the realm will bleed .;Littlefinger;Stannis,Lord,Rock,Redwyne,King,;0.130475206612;10553;332
" Now look at the other side of the coin . Joffrey is but twelve , and Robert gave you the regency , my lord . You are the Hand of the King and Protector of the Realm . The power is yours , Lord Stark . All you need do is reach out and take it . Make your peace with the Lannisters . Release the Imp. Wed Joffrey to your Sansa . Wed your younger girl to Prince Tommen , and your heir to Myrcella . It will be four years before Joffrey comes of age . By then he will look to you as a second father , and if not , well ... four years is a good long while , my lord . Long enough to dispose of Lord Stannis . Then , should Joffrey prove troublesome , we can reveal his little secret and put Lord Renly on the throne . ";Ned;Joffrey,Imp,Lord,;-0.03625;10554;332
" We ? ";Lord;Ned,Littlefinger,;0.0;10555;332
Littlefinger gave a shrug . " You 'll need someone to share your burdens . I assure you , my price would be modest . ";Littlefinger;Lord,Ned,;0.1;10557;332
" Your price . ";Lord;Ned,Littlefinger,;0.0;10558;332

" You forget , " Ned told him . " You forget Jon Arryn . You forget Jory Cassel . And you forget this . ";Ned;Jon,;0.0;10561;332
He drew the dagger and laid it on the table between them ; a length of dragonbone and Valyrian steel , as sharp as the difference between right and wrong , between true and false , between life and death . " They sent a man to cut my son 's throat , Lord Baelish . ";Lord;Ned,Littlefinger,;-0.0778571428571;10562;332
Littlefinger sighed . " I fear I did forget , my lord . Pray forgive me . For a moment I did not remember that I was talking to a Stark . ";Littlefinger;Pray,;-0.2;10563;332
His mouth quirked . " So it will be Stannis , and war ? ";Ned;Stannis,;0.0;10564;332
" It is not a choice . Stannis is the heir . ";Littlefinger;Stannis,;0.0;10565;332
" Far be it from me to dispute the Lord Protector . What would you have of me , then ? Not my wisdom , for a certainty . ";Lord;Farlen,;0.1;10566;332
" I shall do my best to forget your ... wisdom , " Ned said with distaste . " I called you here to ask for the help you promised Catelyn . This is a perilous hour for all of us . Robert has named me Protector , true enough , but in the eyes of the world , Joffrey is still his son and heir . The queen has a dozen knights and a hundred men-at-arms who will do whatever she commands ... enough to overwhelm what remains of my own household guard . And for all I know , her brother Jaime may be riding for King 's Landing even as we speak , with a Lannister host at his back . ";Ned;Robert,Joffrey,Jaime,Catelyn,;0.325;10567;332
" And you without an army . ";Lord;Ned,Littlefinger,;0.0;10568;332
Littlefinger toyed with the dagger on the table , turning it slowly with a finger . " There is small love lost between Lord Renly and the Lannisters .

" Renly has thirty men in his personal guard , the rest even fewer . It is not enough , even if I could be certain that all of them will choose to give me their allegiance . I must have the gold cloaks . The City Watch is two thousand strong , sworn to defend the castle , the city , and the king 's peace . ";Ned;Renly,;0.161904761905;10570;332
" Ah , but when the queen proclaims one king and the Hand another , whose peace do they protect ? ";Lord;Ned,Littlefinger,;0.0;10571;332
When at last it slowed to a stop , the blade pointed at Littlefinger . " Why , there 's your answer , " he said , smiling . " They follow the man who pays them . ";Littlefinger;Lord,Ned,;0.0;10574;332
He leaned back and looked Ned full in the face , his grey-green eyes bright with mockery . " You wear your honor like a suit of armor , Stark . You think it keeps you safe , but all it does is weigh you down and make it hard for you to move . Look at you now . You know why you summoned me here . You know what you want to ask me to do . You know it has to be done ... but it 's not honorable , so the words stick in your throat . ";Ned;Lord,Littlefinger,;0.128968253968;10575;332
Littlefinger laughed . " I ought to make you say it , but that would be cruel ... so have no fear , my good lord . For the sake of the love I bear for Catelyn , I will go to Janos Slynt this very hour and make certain that the City Watch is yours . Six thousand gold pieces should do it . A third for the Commander , a third for the officers , a third for the men . We might be able to buy them for half that much , but I prefer not to take chances .

Jon was breaking his fast on applecakes and blood sausage when Samwell Tarly plopped himself down on the bench . " I 've been summoned to the sept , " Sam said in an excited whisper . " They 're passing me out of training . I 'm to be made a brother with the rest of you . Can you believe it ? ";Jon;Sam,;0.139814814815;10583;333

Mormont stood before the altar , the rainbow shining on his broad bald head . " You came to us outlaws , " he began , " poachers , rapers , debtors , killers , and thieves . You came to us children . You came to us alone , in chains , with neither friends nor honor . You came to us rich , and you came to us poor . Some of you bear the names of proud houses .

Against that : Syrio , in a leather vest , with a wooden sword in his hand . " Syrio , run , " she screamed .;Syrio;Serrett,;0.0;10979;343
" The first sword of Braavos does not run , " he sang as Ser Meryn slashed at him .;Serrett;Braavos,;0.25;10980;343
" No , " she whispered .;Tower;;0.0;11029;344
They could kill her father too , and her if they caught her . " Fear cuts deeper than swords , " she said aloud , but it was no good pretending to be a water dancer , Syrio had been a water dancer and the white knight had probably killed him , and anyhow she was only a little girl with a wooden stick , alone and afraid .;Syrio;;-0.0229166666667;11043;345
Arya was certain he was dead , but when she crept closer , his eyes opened . " Arya Underfoot , " he whispered . " You must ... warn your ... your lord father ... ";Arya;;0.00714285714286;11055;346
Every northerner is worth ten of these southron swords , Desmond had told her . " You liar ! ";Desmond;;0.1875;11066;347
" There she is , " a voice hissed close behind her .;Arya;Syrio,;-0.4;11084;348
His boots were covered with manure , and he had a pitchfork in one hand . " Who are you ? ";Arya;Syrio,;0.0;11087;348
" She do n't know me , " he said , " but I knows her , oh , yes . The wolf girl . ";Arya;Syrio,;0.0;11089;348
" Help me saddle a horse , " Arya pleaded , reaching back into the chest , groping for Needle . " My father 's the Hand of the King , he 'll reward you . ";Arya;Syrio,;0.0;11090;348
" Father 's dead , " the boy said .;Arya;Syrio,;-0.2;11091;348
He shuffled toward her . " It 's the queen who 'll be rewarding me . Come here , girl . ";Arya;Syrio,;0.5;11092;348
" Stay away ! ";Arya;Syrio,;0.0;11093;348
" I says , come . ";Syrio;Arya,;0.0;11095;348
His hands closed around the blade . " Oh , gods , " he moaned , as his undertunic began to redden . " Take it out . ";Arya;;-0.1;11102;349
With each step she took , the shadows moved against the walls , as if they were turning to watch her pass . " Dragons , " she whispered .;Arya;;0.0;11165;350
Robb smiled when she said that . " There are worse things than spiders and rats , " he whispered . " This is where the dead walk . ";Robb;;-1.85037170771e-17;11189;351
It was only Jon , covered with flour . " You stupid , " she told him , " you scared the baby , " but Jon and Robb just laughed and laughed , and pretty soon Bran and Arya were laughing too .;Robb;;0.17;11194;351
" I 'm certain your father is well , " Sansa told her when she had finally gotten the dress buttoned right . " I 'll ask the queen to let you see him . ";Sansa;;0.25;11208;352
The only time the door opened was late that night , when they thrust Jeyne Poole inside , bruised and shaking . " They 're killing everyone , " the steward 's daughter had shrieked at her .;Jeyne;;-0.15;11218;353
" Please , I need to speak to the queen again , " Sansa told them , as she told everyone she saw that day . " She 'll want to talk to me , I know she will . Tell her I want to see her , please . If not the queen , then Prince Joffrey , if you'd be so kind . We 're to marry when we 're older . ";Sansa;Jeyne,;0.383333333333;11233;354
" What is it ? ";Sansa;Jeyne,;0.0;11238;354
Jeyne asked , covering her ears . " Why are they ringing the bells ? ";Jeyne;Sansa,;0.0;11239;354
" The king is dead . ";Sansa;Jeyne,;-0.2;11240;354
The beast had the soft sheen of gold , and his eyes were tiny rubies . " You look very handsome and splendid this morning , Ser Boros , " Sansa told him .;Sansa;Boros,Arys,;0.395833333333;11256;355
" And you , my lady , " Ser Boros said in a flat voice . " Her Grace awaits . Come with me . ";Boros;Grace,;-0.025;11258;355
It was the first time she had been allowed outside the chamber since Ser Arys Oakheart had led her there two mornings past . " To keep you safe , my sweet one , " Queen Cersei had told her . " Joffrey would never forgive me if anything happened to his precious . ";Arys;Joffrey,;0.225;11261;355
" Your Grace , " Ser Boros said when they were ushered inside by another of the Kingsguard , Ser Mandon of the curiously dead face , " I 've brought the girl . ";Boros;;-0.2;11270;356
Cersei smiled to see her , and Sansa thought it was the sweetest and saddest smile she had ever seen . " Sansa , my sweet child , " she said , " I know you 've been asking for me . I 'm sorry that I could not send for you sooner . Matters have been very unsettled , and I have not had a moment . I trust my people have been taking good care of you ? ";Cersei;Sansa,Boros,Lord,Littlefinger,Maester,Joffrey,Arys,Varys,;0.266666666667;11278;357
" Everyone has been very sweet and pleasant , Your Grace , thank you ever so much for asking , " Sansa said politely . " Only , well , no one will talk to us or tell us what 's happened ... ";Sansa;Cersei,Boros,Lord,Littlefinger,Maester,Joffrey,Arys,Varys,;0.322083333333;11279;357
" Us ? ";Cersei;Sansa,Boros,Lord,Littlefinger,Maester,Joffrey,Arys,Varys,;0.0;11280;357
" We put the steward 's girl in with her , " Ser Boros said . " We did not know what else to do with her . ";Boros;Cersei,Sansa,Lord,Littlefinger,Maester,Joffrey,Arys,Varys,;0.0;11282;357
The queen frowned . " Next time , you will ask , " she said , her voice sharp . " The gods only know what sort of tales she 's been filling Sansa 's head with . ";Cersei;Sansa,;-0.0416666666667;11283;357
" Jeyne 's scared , " Sansa said . " She wo n't stop crying . I promised her I'd ask if she could see her father . ";Sansa;Cersei,Boros,Lord,Littlefinger,Maester,Joffrey,Arys,Varys,;-0.2;11284;357
" Her father is well , is n't he ? ";Maester;Cersei,Sansa,Boros,Lord,Littlefinger,Joffrey,Arys,Varys,;0.0;11286;357
Queen Cersei looked at each of the councillors in turn . " I wo n't have Sansa fretting needlessly . What shall we do with this little friend of hers , my lords ? ";Cersei;Sansa,;-0.1875;11290;357
Lord Petyr leaned forward . " I 'll find a place for her . ";Lord;Cersei,Sansa,Boros,Littlefinger,Maester,Joffrey,Arys,Varys,;0.0;11291;357
" Not in the city , " said the queen .;Sansa;Cersei,Boros,Lord,Littlefinger,Maester,Joffrey,Arys,Varys,;0.0;11292;357
" Do you take me for a fool ? ";Cersei;Sansa,Boros,Lord,Littlefinger,Maester,Joffrey,Arys,Varys,;0.0;11293;357
The queen ignored that . " Ser Boros , escort this girl to Lord Petyr 's apartments and instruct his people to keep her there until he comes for her . Tell her that Littlefinger will be taking her to see her father , that ought to calm her down . I want her gone before Sansa returns to her chamber . ";Sansa;Littlefinger,;0.0722222222222;11294;357
" As you command , Your Grace , " Ser Boros said .;Boros;Cersei,Sansa,Lord,Littlefinger,Maester,Joffrey,Arys,Varys,;0.0;11295;357
Sansa was confused . " I do n't understand , " she said . " Where is Jeyne 's father ? Why ca n't Ser Boros take her to him instead of Lord Petyr having to do it ? ";Sansa;Boros,Jeyne,;-0.4;11297;357
For a second she thought she might cry . " Where are you sending her ? She has n't done anything wrong , she 's a good girl . ";Cersei;Sansa,Boros,Lord,Littlefinger,Maester,Joffrey,Arys,Varys,;0.05;11299;357
" She 's upset you , " the queen said gently . " We ca n't be having that . Not another word , now . Lord Baelish will see that Jeyne 's well taken care of , I promise you . ";Sansa;Lord,;0.0;11300;357
She patted the chair beside her . " Sit down , Sansa . I want to talk to you . ";Maester;Cersei,Sansa,Boros,Lord,Littlefinger,Joffrey,Arys,Varys,;-0.155555555556;11301;357
" Sweet Sansa , " Queen Cersei said , laying a soft hand on her wrist . " Such a beautiful child . I do hope you know how much Joffrey and I love you . ";Cersei;Sansa,Boros,Lord,Littlefinger,Maester,Joffrey,Arys,Varys,;0.316666666667;11307;357
" You do ? ";Sansa;Cersei,Boros,Lord,Littlefinger,Maester,Joffrey,Arys,Varys,;0.0;11308;357
The queen smiled . " I think of you almost as my own daughter . And I know the love you bear for Joffrey . ";Littlefinger;Cersei,Sansa,Boros,Lord,Maester,Joffrey,Arys,Varys,;0.566666666667;11313;357
She gave a weary shake of her head . " I am afraid we have some grave news about your lord father . You must be brave , child . ";Sansa;Cersei,Boros,Lord,Littlefinger,Maester,Joffrey,Arys,Varys,;0.1;11314;357
Her quiet words gave Sansa a chill . " What is it ? ";Cersei;Sansa,Boros,Lord,Littlefinger,Maester,Joffrey,Arys,Varys,;0.0;11315;357
" Your father is a traitor , dear , " Lord Varys said .;Lord;Cersei,Sansa,Boros,Littlefinger,Maester,Joffrey,Arys,Varys,;0.0;11316;357
Grand Maester Pycelle lifted his ancient head . " With my own ears , I heard Lord Eddard swear to our beloved King Robert that he would protect the young princes as if they were his own sons . And yet the moment the king was dead , he called the small council together to steal Prince Joffrey 's rightful throne . ";Maester;Lord,Joffrey,;0.292857142857;11317;357
" No , " Sansa blurted . " He would n't do that . He would n't ! ";Sansa;Cersei,Boros,Lord,Littlefinger,Maester,Joffrey,Arys,Varys,;0.0;11318;357
The paper was torn and stiff with dried blood , but the broken seal was her father ' s , the direwolf stamped in pale wax . " We found this on the captain of your household guard , Sansa . It is a letter to my late husband 's brother Stannis , inviting him to take the crown . ";Cersei;Sansa,Boros,Lord,Littlefinger,Maester,Joffrey,Arys,Varys,;-0.278571428571;11320;357
" Please , Your Grace , there 's been a mistake . ";Sansa;Cersei,Boros,Lord,Littlefinger,Maester,Joffrey,Arys,Varys,;0.0;11321;357
Sudden panic made her dizzy and faint . " Please , send for my father , he 'll tell you , he would never write such a letter , the king was his friend . ";Cersei;Sansa,Boros,Lord,Littlefinger,Maester,Joffrey,Arys,Varys,;-0.166666666667;11322;357
" Robert thought so , " said the queen . " This betrayal would have broken his heart . The gods are kind , that he did not live to see it . ";Sansa;Robert,;0.112121212121;11323;357
She sighed . " Sansa , sweetling , you must see what a dreadful position this has left us in . You are innocent of any wrong , we all know that , and yet you are the daughter of a traitor . How can I allow you to marry my son ? ";Cersei;Sansa,Boros,Lord,Littlefinger,Maester,Joffrey,Arys,Varys,;-0.25;11324;357
" But I love him , " Sansa wailed , confused and frightened .;Sansa;Cersei,Boros,Lord,Littlefinger,Maester,Joffrey,Arys,Varys,;0.05;11325;357
" How well I know that , child , " Cersei said , her voice so kind and sweet . " Why else should you have come to me and told me of your father 's plan to send you away from us , if not for love ? ";Cersei;Sansa,Boros,Lord,Littlefinger,Maester,Joffrey,Arys,Varys,;0.483333333333;11331;357
" It was for love , " Sansa said in a rush . " Father would n't even give me leave to say farewell . ";Sansa;Father,;0.5;11332;357
She had never done anything so willful before , and she would never have done it then if she had n't loved Joffrey as much as she did . " He was going to take me back to Winterfell and marry me to some hedge knight , even though it was Joff I wanted . I told him , but he would n't listen . ";Joffrey;Cersei,Sansa,Boros,Lord,Littlefinger,Maester,Arys,Varys,;0.266666666667;11334;357
only then Ser Arys had escorted her to the high room in Maegor 's Holdfast and posted guards , and a few hours later , the fighting had begun outside . " Please , " she finished , " you have to let me marry Joffrey , I 'll be ever so good a wife to him , you 'll see . I 'll be a queen just like you , I promise . ";Arys;Joffrey,;0.101666666667;11339;357
Queen Cersei looked to the others . " My lords of the council , what do you say to her plea ? ";Cersei;Sansa,Boros,Lord,Littlefinger,Maester,Joffrey,Arys,Varys,;0.0;11340;357
" The poor child , " murmured Varys . " A love so true and innocent , Your Grace , it would be cruel to deny it ... and yet , what can we do ? Her father stands condemned . ";Varys;Cersei,Sansa,Boros,Lord,Littlefinger,Maester,Joffrey,Arys,;-0.01;11341;357
" A child born of traitor 's seed will find that betrayal comes naturally to her , " said Grand Maester Pycelle . " She is a sweet thing now , but in ten years , who can say what treasons she may hatch ? ";Maester;Cersei,Sansa,Boros,Lord,Littlefinger,Joffrey,Arys,Varys,;0.283333333333;11343;357
" No , " Sansa said , horrified . " I 'm not , I'd never ... I would n't betray Joffrey , I love him , I swear it , I do . ";Sansa;Joffrey,;0.5;11344;357
" Oh , so poignant , " said Varys . " And yet , it is truly said that blood runs truer than oaths . ";Varys;Cersei,Sansa,Boros,Lord,Littlefinger,Maester,Joffrey,Arys,;0.0;11345;357
" She reminds me of the mother , not the father , " Lord Petyr Baelish said quietly . " Look at her . The hair , the eyes . She is the very image of Cat at the same age . ";Lord;Cersei,Sansa,Boros,Littlefinger,Maester,Joffrey,Arys,Varys,;0.1;11346;357
The queen looked at her , troubled , and yet Sansa could see kindness in her clear green eyes . " Child , " she said , " if I could truly believe that you were not like your father , why nothing should please me more than to see you wed to my Joffrey . I know he loves you with all his heart . ";Sansa;Cersei,Boros,Lord,Littlefinger,Maester,Joffrey,Arys,Varys,;-0.025;11347;357
She sighed . " And yet , I fear that Lord Varys and the Grand Maester have the right of it . The blood will tell . I have only to remember how your sister set her wolf on my son . ";Cersei;Lord,;0.261904761905;11348;357
" I 'm not like Arya , " Sansa blurted . " She has the traitor 's blood , not me . I 'm good , ask Septa Mordane , she 'll tell you , I only want to be Joffrey 's loyal and loving wife . ";Sansa;Mordane,Joffrey,;0.395833333333;11349;357
She felt the weight of Cersei 's eyes as the queen studied her face . " I believe you mean it , child . ";Cersei;Sansa,Boros,Lord,Littlefinger,Maester,Joffrey,Arys,Varys,;-0.3125;11350;357
She turned to face the others . " My lords , it seems to me that if the rest of her kin were to remain loyal in this terrible time , that would go a long way toward laying our fears to rest . ";Sansa;Cersei,Boros,Lord,Littlefinger,Maester,Joffrey,Arys,Varys,;-0.238888888889;11351;357
Grand Maester Pycelle stroked his huge soft beard , his wide brow furrowed in thought . " Lord Eddard has three sons . ";Maester;Lord,;0.225;11352;357
" Mere boys , " Lord Petyr said with a shrug . " I should be more concerned with Lady Catelyn and the Tullys . ";Lord;Cersei,Sansa,Boros,Littlefinger,Maester,Joffrey,Arys,Varys,;0.0;11353;357
The queen took Sansa 's hand in both of hers . " Child , do you know your letters ? ";Sansa;Cersei,Boros,Lord,Littlefinger,Maester,Joffrey,Arys,Varys,;0.0;11354;357
" I am pleased to hear that . Perhaps there is hope for you and Joffrey still ... ";Cersei;Sansa,Boros,Lord,Littlefinger,Maester,Joffrey,Arys,Varys,;0.5;11357;357
" What do you want me to do ? ";Sansa;Cersei,Boros,Lord,Littlefinger,Maester,Joffrey,Arys,Varys,;0.0;11358;357
" You must write your lady mother , and your brother , the eldest ... what is his name ? ";Cersei;Sansa,Boros,Lord,Littlefinger,Maester,Joffrey,Arys,Varys,;0.0;11359;357
" Robb , " Sansa said .;Sansa;Cersei,Boros,Lord,Littlefinger,Maester,Joffrey,Arys,Varys,;0.0;11360;357
" The word of your lord father 's treason will no doubt reach them soon . Better that it should come from you . You must tell them how Lord Eddard betrayed his king . ";Cersei;Lord,;0.5;11361;357
Sansa wanted Joffrey desperately , but she did not think she had the courage to do as the queen was asking . " But he never ... I do n't ... Your Grace , I would n't know what to say ... ";Sansa;Cersei,Boros,Lord,Littlefinger,Maester,Joffrey,Arys,Varys,;0.0;11362;357
The queen patted her hand . " We will tell you what to write , child . The important thing is that you urge Lady Catelyn and your brother to keep the king 's peace . ";Cersei;Sansa,Boros,Lord,Littlefinger,Maester,Joffrey,Arys,Varys,;0.4;11363;357
" It will go hard for them if they do n't , " said Grand Maester Pycelle . " By the love you bear them , you must urge them to walk the path of wisdom . ";Maester;Cersei,Sansa,Boros,Lord,Littlefinger,Joffrey,Arys,Varys,;0.236111111111;11364;357
" Your lady mother will no doubt fear for you dreadfully , " the queen said . " You must tell her that you are well and in our care , that we are treating you gently and seeing to your every want . Bid them to come to King 's Landing and pledge their fealty to Joffrey when he takes his throne . If they do that ... why , then we shall know that there is no taint in your blood , and when you come into the flower of your womanhood , you shall wed the king in the Great Sept of Baelor , before the eyes of gods and men . ";Cersei;Sansa,Boros,Lord,Littlefinger,Maester,Joffrey,Arys,Varys,;0.8;11365;357
The words made her breath come faster , yet still Sansa hesitated . " Perhaps ... if I might see my father , talk to him about ... ";Sansa;Cersei,Boros,Lord,Littlefinger,Maester,Joffrey,Arys,Varys,;0.0;11368;357
" Treason ? ";Cersei;Sansa,Boros,Lord,Littlefinger,Maester,Joffrey,Arys,Varys,;0.0;11369;357
" You disappoint me , Sansa , " the queen said , with eyes gone hard as stones . " We 've told you of your father 's crimes . If you are truly as loyal as you say , why should you want to see him ? ";Lord;Cersei,Sansa,Boros,Littlefinger,Maester,Joffrey,Arys,Varys,;0.0208333333333;11371;357
" I ... I only meant ... ";Cersei;Sansa,Boros,Lord,Littlefinger,Maester,Joffrey,Arys,Varys,;0.0;11372;357
Sansa felt her eyes grow wet . " He 's not ... please , he has n't been ... hurt , or ... or ... ";Sansa;Cersei,Boros,Lord,Littlefinger,Maester,Joffrey,Arys,Varys,;-0.1;11373;357
" Lord Eddard has not been harmed , " the queen said .;Cersei;Lord,;0.0;11374;357

" That is a matter for the king to decide , " Grand Maester Pycelle announced ponderously .;Maester;Cersei,Sansa,Boros,Lord,Littlefinger,Joffrey,Arys,Varys,;0.5;11376;357
" I 'll ... I 'll write the letters , " Sansa told them .;Sansa;Lannister,;0.0;11391;358
With a smile as warm as the sunrise , Cersei Lannister leaned close and kissed her gently on the cheek . " I knew you would . Joffrey will be so proud when I tell him what courage and good sense you 've shown here today . ";Lannister;Joffrey,;0.5875;11392;358
" Othor , " announced Ser Jaremy Rykker , " beyond a doubt . And this one was Jafer Flowers . ";Jaremy;Flowers,;0.0;11406;359
He turned the corpse over with his foot , and the dead white face stared up at the overcast sky with blue , blue eyes . " They were Ben Stark 's men , both of them . ";Jaremy;Stark,;-0.08;11407;359
" Gods have mercy , " the Old Bear muttered .;Old;Gods,;0.1;11415;360
So far he had not lurched off to the woods to retch , but he had not so much as glanced at the dead men either . " I ca n't look , " he whispered miserably .;Jaremy;Jon,Old,Mormont,Dywen,;0.0;11441;361
" You have to look , " Jon told him , keeping his voice low so the others would not hear . " Maester Aemon sent you to be his eyes , did n't he ? What good are eyes if they 're shut ? ";Jon;Maester,;0.325;11442;361
" Yes , but ... I 'm such a coward , Jon . ";Jaremy;Jon,Old,Mormont,Dywen,;0.0;11443;361
Jon put a hand on Sam 's shoulder . " We have a dozen rangers with us , and the dogs , even Ghost . No one will hurt you , Sam . Go ahead and look . The first look is the hardest . ";Jon;Old,Jaremy,Mormont,Dywen,;0.25;11444;361
" Ser Jaremy , " the Old Bear asked gruffly , " Ben Stark had six men with him when he rode from the Wall . Where are the others ? ";Old;Stark,;-0.05;11448;361
Ser Jaremy shook his head . " Would that I knew . ";Jaremy;Jon,Old,Mormont,Dywen,;0.0;11449;361
Plainly Mormont was not pleased with that answer . " Two of our brothers butchered almost within sight of the Wall , yet your rangers heard nothing , saw nothing . Is this what the Night 's Watch has fallen to ? Do we still sweep these woods ? ";Mormont;Jon,Old,Jaremy,Dywen,;0.5;11450;361
" Yes , my lord , but - ";Jaremy;Jon,Old,Mormont,Dywen,;0.0;11451;361
" Do we still mount watches ? ";Old;Jon,Jaremy,Mormont,Dywen,;0.0;11452;361

" This man wears a hunting horn . ";Old;Jon,Jaremy,Mormont,Dywen,;0.0;11454;361
Mormont pointed at Othor . " Must I suppose that he died without sounding it ? Or have your rangers all gone deaf as well as blind ? ";Mormont;Jon,Old,Jaremy,Dywen,;-0.5;11455;361
Ser Jaremy bristled , his face taut with anger . " No horn was blown , my lord , or my rangers would have heard it . I do not have sufficient men to mount as many patrols as I should like ... and since Benjen was lost , we have stayed closer to the Wall than we were wont to do before , by your own command . ";Jaremy;Benjen,;0.133333333333;11456;361
The Old Bear grunted . " Yes . Well . Be that as it may . ";Old;Jon,Jaremy,Mormont,Dywen,;0.1;11457;361
He made an impatient gesture . " Tell me how they died . ";Jaremy;Jon,Old,Mormont,Dywen,;-0.2;11458;361
Only a few ropes of pale tendon still attached the head to the neck . " This was done with an axe . ";Old;Jon,Jaremy,Mormont,Dywen,;-0.1;11463;361
" Aye , " muttered Dywen , the old forester . " Belike the axe that Othor carried , m'lord . ";Dywen;Othor,;0.1;11464;361
Ser Jaremy stood . " The Wildlings have axes too . ";Jaremy;Wildling,;0.0;11474;362
Mormont rounded on him . " So you believe this is Mance Rayder 's work ? This close to the Wall ? ";Mormont;Mance,;0.0;11475;362
" Who else , my lord ? ";Jaremy;Mormont,Lord,Sam,Jon,Chett,Dywen,;0.0;11476;362
Yet Lord Commander Mormont gave a snort . " If Ben Stark had come under Wildling attack a half day 's ride from Castle Black , he would have returned for more men , chased the killers through all seven hells and brought me back their heads . ";Lord;Stark,;-0.00666666666667;11482;362
" Unless he was slain as well , " Ser Jaremy insisted .;Jaremy;Mormont,Lord,Sam,Jon,Chett,Dywen,;0.0;11483;362
" It has been close on half a year since Benjen left us , my lord , " Ser Jaremy went on . " The forest is vast . The Wildlings might have fallen on him anywhere . I'd wager these two were the last survivors of his party , on their way back to us ... but the enemy caught them before they could reach the safety of the Wall . The corpses are still fresh , these men cannot have been dead more than a day ... ";Jaremy;Benjen,Wildling,;0.0541666666667;11486;362

" I did not ask for your views , boy , " Rykker said coldly .;Jaremy;Mormont,Lord,Sam,Jon,Chett,Dywen,;0.0;11491;362
" Let him speak , ser , " Jon blurted .;Jon;Jaremy,Mormont,Lord,Sam,Chett,Dywen,;0.0;11492;362
Mormont 's eyes flicked from Sam to Jon and back again . " If the lad has something to say , I 'll hear him out . Come closer , boy . We ca n't see you behind those horses . ";Mormont;Jaremy,Lord,Sam,Jon,Chett,Dywen,;-0.2;11493;362
Sam edged past Jon and the garrons , sweating profusely . " My lord , it ... it ca n't be a day or ... look ... the blood ... ";Sam;Jaremy,Mormont,Lord,Jon,Chett,Dywen,;-0.25;11494;362
" Yes ? ";Jaremy;Mormont,Lord,Sam,Jon,Chett,Dywen,;0.0;11495;362
Mormont growled impatiently . " Blood , what of it ? ";Mormont;Jaremy,Lord,Sam,Jon,Chett,Dywen,;0.0;11496;362
" He soils his smallclothes at the sight of it , " Chett shouted out , and the rangers laughed .;Chett;Jaremy,Mormont,Lord,Sam,Jon,Dywen,;0.7;11497;362
Sam mopped at the sweat on his brow . " You ... you can see where Ghost ... Jon 's direwolf ... you can see where he tore off that man 's hand , and yet ... the stump has n't bled , look ... ";Sam;Jaremy,Mormont,Lord,Jon,Chett,Dywen,;0.0;11498;362

Now that he had looked at the bodies , he could not seem to look away . " A fresh kill ... the blood would still flow , my lords . Later ... later it would be clotted , like a ... a jelly , thick and ... and ... ";Sam;Jaremy,Mormont,Lord,Jon,Chett,Dywen,;-1.38777878078e-17;11501;362

Yet Jaremy Rykker was unconvinced . " If they'd been dead much longer than a day , they'd be ripe by now , boy . They do n't even smell . ";Jaremy;Mormont,Lord,Sam,Jon,Chett,Dywen,;-0.05;11506;362
Dywen , the gnarled old forester who liked to boast that he could smell snow coming on , sidled closer to the corpses and took a whiff . " Well , they 're no pansy flowers , but ... m'lord has the truth of it . There 's no corpse stink . ";Dywen;Jaremy,Mormont,Lord,Sam,Jon,Chett,;0.35;11507;362
" They ... they are n't rotting . ";Jaremy;Mormont,Lord,Sam,Jon,Chett,Dywen,;0.0;11508;362
Sam pointed , his fat finger shaking only a little .

Mormont frowned , glancing from the corpses to the dogs . " Chett , bring the hounds closer . ";Mormont;Jaremy,Lord,Sam,Jon,Chett,Dywen,;0.0;11512;362
" This ... this is all wrong , " Sam Tarly said earnestly .

";Sam;Dywen,Jaremy,Jon,Old,Mormont,;-0.286111111111;11520;363
Sam made himself swallow , took a deep breath . " With those wounds ... terrible wounds ... there should be blood all over . Should n't there ? ";Sam;Dywen,Jaremy,Jon,Old,Mormont,;-0.5;11521;363

Ser Jaremy looked startled . " Neither did Flowers , " he blurted , turning to stare at the dead man .;Jaremy;Flowers,;-0.2;11524;363
" Burn them , " someone whispered .;Sam;Dywen,Jaremy,Jon,Old,Mormont,;0.0;11528;363
One of the rangers ; Jon could not have said who . " Yes , burn them , " a second voice urged .;Jon;Sam,Dywen,Jaremy,Old,Mormont,;0.0;11529;363
The Old Bear gave a stubborn shake of his head . " Not yet . I want Maester Aemon to have a look at them . We 'll bring them back to the Wall . ";Old;Maester,;0.05;11530;363
" I will have these woods searched , " Mormont commanded Ser Jaremy as they set out . " Every tree , every rock , every bush , and every foot of muddy ground within ten leagues of here . Use all the men you have , and if you do not have enough , borrow hunters and foresters from the stewards . If Ben and the others are out here , dead or alive , I will have them found . And if there is anyone else in these woods , I will know of it . You are to track them and take them , alive if possible . Is that understood ? ";Mormont;Sam,Dywen,Jaremy,Jon,Old,;0.0;11536;363
" It is , my lord , " Ser Jaremy said . " It will be done . ";Jaremy;Sam,Dywen,Jon,Old,Mormont,;0.0;11537;363
Mormont reined up suddenly and turned in his saddle . " Tarly , " he barked , " come here . ";Mormont;Jon,;0.0;11559;364
Jon saw the start of fright on Sam 's face as he lumbered up on his mare ; doubtless he thought he was in trouble . " You 're fat but you 're not stupid , boy , " the Old Bear said gruffly . " You did well back there . And you , Snow . ";Jon;Mormont,;-0.233333333333;11560;364

" What is it , man ? ";Pyp;Mormont,Marsh,Noye,Robert,;0.0;11573;365
Curiously , Marsh glanced at Jon before he answered . " Maester Aemon has the letter . He 's waiting in your solar . ";Marsh;Maester,;0.0;11575;365
" Very well . Jon , see to my horse , and tell Ser Jaremy to put the dead men in a storeroom until the maester is ready for them . ";Pyp;Jaremy,;0.0666666666667;11576;365

Grenn and Toad were on watch , but he found Pyp in the common hall . " What 's happened ? ";Pyp;Mormont,Marsh,Noye,Robert,;-0.3;11586;365
Pyp lowered his voice . " The king 's dead . ";Pyp;Mormont,Marsh,Noye,Robert,;-0.2;11588;365
Robert Baratheon had looked old and fat when he visited Winterfell , yet he'd seemed hale enough , and there'd been no talk of illness . " How can you know ? ";Robert;Mormont,Marsh,Noye,Pyp,;0.05;11590;365

Pyp was all curiosity . " How queer ? ";Pyp;Jon,Mormont,Old,;0.0;11605;366
" Sam will tell you . ";Mormont;Sam,;0.0;11606;366
Jon did not want to talk of it . " I should see if the Old Bear has need of me . ";Jon;Old,;0.1;11607;366
The brothers on guard eyed him solemnly as he approached . " The Old Bear 's in his solar , " one of them announced . " He was asking for you . ";Pyp;Jon,Mormont,Old,;0.1;11609;366

" Do n't you believe it , I just fed him , " the Old Bear growled .;Old;Pyp,Jon,Mormont,;0.1;11616;366

There was pity in that look ; he could taste it . " You heard me . ";Pyp;Jon,Mormont,Old,;0.0;11620;366
Yet all too soon , they were filled . " Sit , boy , " Mormont commanded him . " Drink . ";Mormont;Pyp,Jon,Old,;0.4;11623;366
Jon remained standing . " It 's my father , is n't it ? ";Jon;Pyp,Mormont,Old,;0.0;11624;366
The Old Bear tapped the letter with a finger . " Your father and the king , " he rumbled . " I wo n't lie to you , it 's grievous news . I never thought to see another king , not at my age , with Robert half my years and strong as a bull . ";Old;Robert,;-0.108333333333;11625;366

" As to that , I cannot say , lad . I mean to send a letter . I knew some of the king 's councillors in my youth . Old Pycelle , Lord Stannis , Ser Barristan ...

Jon himself he had scarcely even noticed ; bastards were beneath even his contempt . " My lord , will the king listen to you ? ";Jon;Old,Lord,Mormont,;0.0;11650;368
The Old Bear shrugged . " A boy king ... I imagine he 'll listen to his mother . A pity the dwarf is n't with them . He 's the lad 's uncle , and he saw our need when he visited us . It was a bad thing , your lady mother taking him captive - ";Old;Jon,Lord,Mormont,;-0.105555555556;11651;368
" Lady Stark is not my mother , " Jon reminded him sharply .;Jon;Stark,;-0.2;11652;368

" Pycelle makes no mention of them , but doubtless they 'll be treated gently . I will ask about them when I write . ";Jon;Pycelle,;0.0;11655;368

He gave Jon a long shrewd look . " I hope you are not thinking of doing anything stupid , boy . ";Jon;Old,Lord,Mormont,;-0.425;11657;368
" Your duty is here now , " the Lord Commander reminded him . " Your old life ended when you took the black . ";Lord;Old,Jon,Mormont,;-0.0333333333333;11661;368
His bird made a raucous echo . " Black . ";Jon;Old,Lord,Mormont,;-0.233333333333;11662;368
Mormont took no notice . " Whatever they do in King 's Landing is none of our concern . ";Mormont;Landing,;0.0;11663;368
When Jon did not answer , the old man finished his wine and said , " You 're free to go . I 'll have no further need of you today . On the morrow you can help me write that letter . ";Jon;Old,Lord,Mormont,;0.166666666667;11664;368
Outside , one of the guards looked at him and said , " Be strong , boy . The gods are cruel . ";Lord;Old,Jon,Mormont,;-0.188888888889;11667;368
They know , Jon realized . " My father is no traitor , " he said hoarsely .;Jon;Old,Lord,Mormont,;0.0;11668;368
His friends rallied to him . " We asked the septon to light a candle for your father , " Matthar told him . " It 's a lie , we all know it 's a lie , even Grenn knows it 's a lie , " Pyp chimed in .;Matthar;Grenn,;0.4;11685;369
Grenn nodded , and Sam clasped Jon 's hand , " You 're my brother now , so he 's my father too , " the fat boy said . " If you want to go out to the weirwoods and pray to the old gods , I 'll go with you . ";Grenn;Matthar,Alliser,;0.1;11686;369
And then he heard the laughter , sharp and cruel as a whip , and the voice of Ser Alliser Thorne . " Not only a bastard , but a traitor 's bastard , " he was telling the men around him .;Alliser;Matthar,Grenn,;-0.375;11690;369
Later , much later , after they had marched him back to his sleeping cell , Mormont came down to see him , raven on his shoulder . " I told you not to do anything stupid , boy , " the Old Bear said . " Boy , " the bird chorused .;Mormont;;-0.142592592593;11697;370
Mormont shook his head , disgusted . " And to think I had high hopes for you . ";Mormont;;-0.42;11698;370
" My father is no traitor , " he told the direwolf when the rest had gone .;Mormont;;0.0;11702;370
Jon was startled to see how tall he'd grown . " Ghost , what is it ? ";Jon;;0.0;11710;371
Jon wondered . " It 's me , Ghost , " he murmured , trying not to sound afraid .;Jon;;-0.1;11714;371
Jon watched him with mounting disquiet . " There 's someone out there , is n't there ? ";Jon;;0.0;11719;371
Suddenly he heard the shriek of Mormont 's raven . " Corn , " the bird was screaming . " Corn , corn , corn , corn , corn , corn . ";Mormont;;0.0;11745;372
Heavy drapes had been pulled across the windows , and the darkness was black as ink . " Who 's there ? ";Mormont;;-0.183333333333;11750;372
Mormont 's raven was flapping overhead , screaming , " Corn , corn , corn , corn . ";Mormont;;0.0;11756;372
Jon held the longsword before him . " Stay away ! ";Jon;;0.0;11781;373
he commanded , his voice gone shrill . " Corn , " screamed the raven , " corn , corn . ";Jon;;-0.4;11782;373
The flame flickered and almost died . " Burn ! ";Old;kiss,;0.0;11808;374
the raven cawed . " Burn , burn , burn ! ";Old;kiss,;0.0;11809;374
The heat of it on his face was sweeter than any kiss Jon had ever known . " Ghost ! ";kiss;Old,;0.0;11813;374
But Robb had forbidden him to leave the castle . " We have no men to spare to guard you , " his brother had explained .;Robb;Bran,;0.0;11832;375
" I 'll take Summer , " Bran argued .;Bran;Summer,;0.0;11833;375
" Do n't act the boy with me , Bran , " Robb said . " You know better than that . Only two days ago one of Lord Bolton 's men knifed one of Lord Cerwyn 's at the Smoking Log . Our lady mother would skin me for a pelt if I let you put yourself at risk . ";Robb;Lord,;0.25;11834;375
" How many is it now ? ";Maester;Bran,Hodor,;0.5;11852;376
" Twelve thousand men , or near enough as makes no matter . ";Hodor;Maester,Bran,;0.05;11854;376
" How many knights ? ";Maester;Bran,Hodor,;0.5;11855;376
" Few enough , " the maester said with a touch of impatience . " To be a knight , you must stand your vigil in a sept , and be anointed with the seven oils to consecrate your vows . In the north , only a few of the great houses worship the Seven . The rest honor the old gods , and name no knights ... but those lords and their sons and sworn swords are no less fierce or loyal or honorable . A man 's worth is not marked by a ser before his name . As I have told you a hundred times before . ";Hodor;Maester,Bran,;0.106666666667;11856;376
" Still , " said Bran , " how many knights ? ";Bran;Maester,Hodor,;0.5;11857;376
Maester Luwin sighed . " Three hundred , perhaps four ... among three thousand armored lances who are not knights . ";Maester;Bran,Hodor,;0.0;11858;376
" Lord Karstark is the last , " Bran said thoughtfully . " Robb will feast him tonight . ";Bran;Lord,Robb,;0.0;11859;376
" No doubt he will . ";Maester;Bran,Hodor,;0.0;11860;376
" How long before ... before they go ? ";Hodor;Maester,Bran,;-0.05;11861;376
" He must march soon , or not at all , " Maester Luwin said . " The winter town is full to bursting , and this army of his will eat the countryside clean if it camps here much longer . Others are waiting to join him all along the kingsroad , barrow knights and crannogmen and the Lords Manderly and Flint . The fighting has begun in the riverlands , and your brother has many leagues to go . ";Maester;Bran,Hodor,;0.329166666667;11862;376
" I know . ";Bran;Maester,Hodor,;0.0;11863;376
It felt queer to look down on him this way , when he'd spent his whole life looking up at him , but when you sat on Hodor 's back you looked down on everyone . " I do n't want to watch anymore . Hodor , take me back to the keep . ";Hodor;Maester,Bran,;-0.0222222222222;11867;376
" Hodor , " said Hodor .;Hodor;Maester,Bran,;0.0;11868;376
Maester Luwin tucked the tube up his sleeve . " Bran , your lord brother will not have time to see you now . He must greet Lord Karstark and his sons and make them welcome . ";Maester;Bran,Hodor,;0.8;11869;376
" I wo n't trouble Robb . I want to visit the godswood . ";Bran;Robb,;0.0;11870;376
He put his hand on Hodor 's shoulder . " Hodor . ";Hodor;Maester,Bran,;0.0;11871;376
He refused to let it trouble him . " Men will look at you , " Maester Luwin had warned him the first time they had strapped the wicker basket around Hodor 's chest . " They will look , and they will talk , and some will mock you . ";Maester;;0.25;11884;377
The scent of the direwolves sent horses into a frenzy of fear if they were not accustomed to it , but they'd quiet soon enough once Summer was gone . " The godswood , " Bran reminded Hodor .;Summer;;0.0;11891;378
He hung for a moment , dangling , the dark red leaves brushing against his face , until Hodor lifted him and lowered him to the smooth stone beside the water . " I want to be by myself for a while , " he said . " You go soak . Go to the pools . ";Hodor;;0.0833333333333;11904;379
" Hodor . ";Hodor;;0.0;11905;379
" Please make it so Robb wo n't go away , " he prayed softly .;Bran;Robb,;0.0;11918;380
He moved his hand through the cold water , sending ripples across the pool . " Please make him stay . Or if he has to go , bring him home safe , with Mother and Father and the girls . And make it ... make it so Rickon understands . ";Bran;Rickon,;-0.05;11919;380
Maester Luwin counseled Robb to remain at Winterfell , and Bran pleaded with him too , for his own sake as much as Rickon ' s , but his brother only shook his head stubbornly and said , " I do n't want to go . I have to . ";Maester;;0.233333333333;11926;381
Maester Luwin urged him to do just that , but Robb would not hear of it . " My lord father would never have sent men off to die while he huddled like a craven behind the walls of Winterfell , " he said , all Robb the Lord .;Maester;;-0.4;11930;381
And when Lord Umber , who was called the Greatjon by his men and stood as tall as Hodor and twice as wide , threatened to take his forces home if he was placed behind the Hornwoods or the Cerwyns in the order of march , Robb told him he was welcome to do so . " And when we are done with the Lannisters , " he promised , scratching Grey Wind behind the ear , " we will march back north , root you out of your keep , and hang you for an oathbreaker . ";Robb;Bran,;-0.025;11941;382
Yet Robb only said a quiet word , and in a snarl and the blink of an eye Lord Umber was on his back , his sword spinning on the floor three feet away and his hand dripping blood where Grey Wind had bitten off two fingers . " My lord father taught me that it was death to bare steel against your liege lord , " Robb said , " but doubtless you only meant to cut my meat . ";Robb;Bran,;0.0;11945;382
but then , astonishingly , the huge man laughed . " Your meat , " he roared , " is bloody tough . ";Robb;Bran,;-0.0222222222222;11947;382
Yet that very night , his brother came to Bran 's bedchamber pale and shaken , after the fires had burned low in the Great Hall . " I thought he was going to kill me , " Robb confessed . " Did you see the way he threw down Hal , like he was no bigger than Rickon ? Gods , I was so scared . And the Greatjon 's not the worst of them , only the loudest . Lord Roose never says a word , he only looks at me , and all I can think of is that room they have in the Dreadfort , where the Boltons hang the skins of their enemies . ";Robb;Greatjon,;-0.0194444444444;11949;382
" That 's just one of Old Nan 's stories , " Bran said .;Bran;Robb,;0.1;11950;382
A note of doubt crept into his voice . " Is n't it ? ";Robb;Bran,;0.0;11951;382
" I do n't know . ";Robb;Bran,;0.0;11952;382
He gave a weary shake of his head . " Lord Cerwyn means to take his daughter south with us . To cook for him , he says . Theon is certain I 'll find the girl in my bedroll one night . I wish ... I wish Father was here ... ";Robb;Lord,Theon,Father,;0.214285714286;11953;382
Bran would never forget the look on Robb 's face as he stared at their sister 's words . " She says Father conspired at treason with the king 's brothers , " he read . " King Robert is dead , and Mother and I are summoned to the Red Keep to swear fealty to Joffrey . She says we must be loyal , and when she marries Joffrey she will plead with him to spare our lord father 's life . ";Bran;Father,King,;0.0444444444444;11966;383
His fingers closed into a fist , crushing Sansa 's letter between them . " And she says nothing of Arya , nothing , not so much as a word . Damn her ! What 's wrong with the girl ? ";Sansa;Bran,;0.0;11967;383
Bran felt all cold inside . " She lost her wolf , " he said , weakly , remembering the day when four of his father 's guardsmen had returned from the south with Lady 's bones .;Bran;Sansa,;-0.6;11968;383
" If Robb has to go , watch over him , " Bran entreated the old gods , as they watched him with the heart tree 's red eyes , " and watch over his men , Hal and Quent and the rest , and Lord Umber and Lady Mormont and the other lords . And Theon too , I suppose . Watch them and keep them safe , if it please you , gods . Help them defeat the Lannisters and save Father and bring them home . ";Bran;Robb,Lannister,;0.11875;11980;384
Summer bared his teeth . " You hear them , boy ? ";Summer;Bran,;0.0;11982;384
" Summer , to me , " Bran called .;Bran;Osha,Mikken,;0.0;11989;385
Bran wrapped his arms around him . " What are you doing here ? ";Bran;Osha,Mikken,;0.0;11991;385
" They are my gods too , " Osha said . " Beyond the Wall , they are the only gods . ";Osha;Bran,Mikken,;0.0;11993;385
It made her look more womanly , that and the simple dress of brown roughspun they'd given her when they took her mail and leather . " Gage lets me have my prayers from time to time , when I feel the need , and I let him do as he likes under my skirt , when he feels the need . It 's nothing to me . I like the smell of flour on his hands , and he 's gentler than Stiv . ";Bran;Osha,Mikken,;0.166666666667;11995;385
She gave an awkward bow . " I 'll leave you . There 's pots that want scouring . ";Osha;Bran,Mikken,;-0.6;11996;385
" No , stay , " Bran commanded her . " Tell me what you meant , about hearing the gods . ";Bran;Osha,Mikken,;0.0;11997;385
Osha studied him . " You asked them and they 're answering . Open your ears , listen , you 'll hear . ";Osha;Bran,Mikken,;0.0;11998;385
Bran listened . " It 's only the wind , " he said after a moment , uncertain . " The leaves are rustling . ";Bran;Osha,Mikken,;0.0;11999;385
" Who do you think sends the wind , if not the gods ? ";Osha;Bran,Mikken,;0.0;12000;385
Mikken had fixed iron manacles to her ankles , with a heavy chain between them ; she could walk , so long as she kept her strides small , but there was no way for her to run , or climb , or mount a horse . " They see you , boy . They hear you talking . That rustling , that 's them talking back . ";Mikken;Bran,Osha,;-0.08;12002;385
" What are they saying ? ";Osha;Bran,Mikken,;0.0;12003;385
" They 're sad . Your lord brother will get no help from them , not where he 's going . The old gods have no power in the south . The weirwoods there were all cut down , thousands of years ago . How can they watch your brother when they have no eyes ? ";Bran;Osha,Mikken,;-0.185185185185;12004;385
Bran heard muffled footfalls and a low humming , and Hodor came blundering out of the trees , naked and smiling . " Hodor ! ";Bran;Hodor,Osha,;0.0;12012;386
" He must have heard our voices , " Bran said . " Hodor , you forgot your clothes . ";Bran;Hodor,Osha,;0.0;12013;386
" Hodor , " Hodor agreed .;Hodor;Bran,Osha,;0.0;12014;386
Osha eyed him with a sour smile . " Now there 's a big man , " she said . " He has giant 's blood in him , or I 'm the queen . ";Osha;Bran,Hodor,;0.1;12018;386
" Maester Luwin says there are no more giants . He says they 're all dead , like the children of the forest . All that 's left of them are old bones in the earth that men turn up with plows from time to time . ";Bran;Maester,earth,;0.1;12019;386
" Let Maester Luwin ride beyond the Wall , " Osha said . " He 'll find giants then , or they 'll find him . My brother killed one . Ten foot tall she was , and stunted at that . They 've been known to grow big as twelve and thirteen feet . Fierce things they are too , all hair and teeth , and the wives have beards like their husbands , so there 's no telling them apart . The women take human men for lovers , and it 's from them the half bloods come . It goes harder on the women they catch . The men are so big they 'll rip a maid apart before they get her with child . ";Osha;Maester,;-0.0444444444444;12020;386
She grinned at him . " But you do n't know what I mean , do you , boy ? ";Hodor;Bran,Osha,;-0.3125;12021;386
" Yes I do , " Bran insisted .;Bran;Hodor,Osha,;0.0;12022;386
He looked at Hodor . " Go back and bring your clothes , Hodor , " he said . " Go dress . ";Hodor;Bran,Osha,;0.0;12025;386
" Hodor . ";Osha;Bran,Hodor,;0.0;12026;386
He was awfully big , Bran thought as he watched him go . " Are there truly giants beyond the Wall ? ";Bran;Hodor,Osha,;0.0;12028;386
" Giants and worse than giants , Lordling . I tried to tell your brother when he asked his questions , him and your maester and that smiley boy Greyjoy . The cold winds are rising , and men go out from their fires and never come back ... or if they do , they 're not men no more , but only wights , with blue eyes and cold black hands . Why do you think I run south with Stiv and Hali and the rest of them fools ? Mance thinks he 'll fight , the brave sweet stubborn man , like the white walkers were no more than rangers , but what does he know ? He can call himself King-beyond-the-Wall all he likes , but he 's still just another old black crow who flew down from the Shadow Tower . He 's never tasted winter . I was born up there , child , like my mother and her mother before her and her mother before her , born of the Free Folk . We remember . ";Hodor;Mance,;0.0350694444444;12030;386
Osha stood , her chains rattling together . " I tried to tell your lordling brother . Only yesterday , when I saw him in the yard . ' M'lord Stark , ' I called to him , respectful as you please , but he looked through me , and that sweaty oaf Greatjon Umber shoves me out of the path . So be it . I 'll wear my irons and hold my tongue . A man who wo n't listen ca n't hear . ";Osha;Bran,Hodor,;0.1;12031;386
" Tell me . Robb will listen to me , I know he will . ";Bran;Robb,;0.0;12032;386
" Will he now ? We 'll see . You tell him this , m'lord . You tell him he 's bound on marching the wrong way . It 's north he should be taking his swords . North , not south . You hear me ? ";Osha;Bran,Hodor,;-0.5;12033;386
Bran nodded . " I 'll tell him . ";Bran;Hodor,Osha,;0.0;12034;386
It had grown quiet . " My lords , " Hallis Mollen announced , " Brandon Stark , of Winterfell . ";Mollen;Bran,Torrhen,Luwin,Maester,Robb,;-0.1;12041;387
" I welcome you to our fires , " Bran said stiffly , " and offer you meat and mead in honor of our friendship . ";Bran;Mollen,Torrhen,Luwin,Maester,Robb,;0.8;12042;387
Harrion Karstark , the oldest of Lord Rickard 's sons , bowed , and his brothers after him , yet as they settled back in their places he heard the younger two talking in low voices , over the clatter of wine cups . " ... sooner die than live like that , " muttered one , his father 's namesake Eddard , and his brother Torrhen said likely the boy was broken inside as well as out , too craven to take his own life .;Torrhen;Mollen,Bran,Luwin,Maester,Robb,;0.0480519480519;12043;387
Bran the Broken ? " I do n't want to be broken , " he whispered fiercely to Maester Luwin , who'd been seated to his right . " I want to be a knight . ";Bran;Mollen,Torrhen,Luwin,Maester,Robb,;-0.171428571429;12046;387
" There are some who call my order the knights of the mind , " Luwin replied . " You are a surpassing clever boy when you work at it , Bran . Have you ever thought that you might wear a maester 's chain ? There is no limit to what you might learn . ";Luwin;Mollen,Bran,Torrhen,Maester,Robb,;0.166666666667;12047;387
" I want to learn magic , " Bran told him . " The crow promised that I would fly . ";Bran;Mollen,Torrhen,Luwin,Maester,Robb,;0.65;12048;387
Maester Luwin sighed . " I can teach you history , healing , herblore . I can teach you the speech of ravens , and how to build a castle , and the way a sailor steers his ship by the stars . I can teach you to measure the days and mark the seasons , and at the Citadel in Oldtown they can teach you a thousand things more . But , Bran , no man can teach you magic . ";Maester;Mollen,Bran,Torrhen,Luwin,Robb,;0.5;12049;387
" The children could , " Bran said . " The children of the forest . ";Bran;Mollen,Torrhen,Luwin,Maester,Robb,;0.0;12050;387
The maester listened politely . " The Wildling woman could give Old Nan lessons in telling tales , I think , " he said when Bran was done . " I will talk with her again if you like , but it would be best if you did not trouble your brother with this folly . He has more than enough to concern him without fretting over giants and dead men in the woods . It 's the Lannisters who hold your lord father , Bran , not the children of the forest . ";Bran;Lannister,;0.28;12052;387
He put a gentle hand on Bran 's arm . " Think on what I said , child . ";Bran;Mollen,Torrhen,Luwin,Maester,Robb,;0.2;12053;387
" You are the lord in Winterfell now , " Robb told him .;Robb;Mollen,Bran,Torrhen,Luwin,Maester,;0.0;12055;387
His brother wore grey chainmail over bleached leathers , sword and dagger at his waist , a fur-trimmed cloak across his shoulders . " You must take my place , as I took Father ' s , until we come home . ";Maester;Father,;-0.05;12057;387
" I know , " Bran replied miserably .;Bran;Mollen,Torrhen,Luwin,Maester,Robb,;0.0;12058;387
" Listen to Maester Luwin 's counsel , and take care of Rickon . Tell him that I 'll be back as soon as the fighting is done . ";Robb;Mollen,Bran,Torrhen,Luwin,Maester,;0.0;12061;387
He was up in his chamber , red-eyed and defiant . " No ! ";Maester;Mollen,Bran,Torrhen,Luwin,Robb,;0.0;12063;387
he'd screamed when Bran had asked if he did n't want to say farewell to Robb . " NO farewell ! ";Bran;Mollen,Torrhen,Luwin,Maester,Robb,;0.0;12064;387
" I told him , " Bran said . " He says no one ever comes back . ";Bran;Mollen,Torrhen,Luwin,Maester,Robb,;0.0;12065;387
" He ca n't be a baby forever . He 's a Stark , and near four . ";Maester;Stark,;-0.05;12066;387
Robb sighed . " Well , Mother will be home soon . And I 'll bring back Father , I promise . ";Robb;Mother,;0.0;12067;387
The huge stableboy had a lost and frightened look to his face . " Hodor ? ";Bran;;0.4;12083;388
" Hodor , " Bran agreed , wondering what it meant .;Bran;;0.0;12085;388
The khal 's mouth twisted in a frown beneath the droop of his long mustachio . " The stallion who mounts the world has no need of iron chairs . ";khal;Drogo,Dany,;-0.275;12093;389
It had never been cut ; he had never known defeat . " It was prophesied that the stallion will ride to the ends of the earth , " she said .;Dany;khal,Drogo,;0.0;12096;389
" The earth ends at the black salt sea , " Drogo answered at once .;Drogo;khal,Dany,;-0.166666666667;12097;389
He wet a cloth in a basin of warm water to wipe the sweat and oil from his skin . " No horse can cross the poison water . ";khal;Drogo,Dany,;0.166666666667;12098;389
" In the Free Cities , there are ships by the thousand , " Dany told him , as she had told him before . " Wooden horses with a hundred legs , that fly across the sea on wings full of wind . ";Dany;khal,Drogo,;0.3875;12099;389
Khal Drogo did not want to hear it . " We will speak no more of wooden horses and iron chairs . ";Drogo;khal,Dany,;0.25;12100;389
He dropped the cloth and began to dress . " This day I will go to the grass and hunt , woman wife , " he announced as he shrugged into a painted vest and buckled on a wide belt with heavy medallions of silver , gold , and bronze .;khal;Drogo,Dany,;-0.15;12101;389
" Yes , my sun-and-stars , " Dany said .;Dany;khal,Drogo,;0.0;12102;389
Coarse black hair covered his thick chest and muscular arms . " My princess . How may I serve you ? ";Dany;;-0.155555555556;12116;390
" You must talk to my lord husband , " Dany said . " Drogo says the stallion who mounts the world will have all the lands of the earth to rule , and no need to cross the poison water . He talks of leading his khalasar east after Rhaego is born , to plunder the lands around the Jade Sea . ";Dany;Drogo,Rhaego,;0.0;12117;390
The knight looked thoughtful . " The khal has never seen the Seven Kingdoms , " he said . " They are nothing to him . If he thinks of them at all , no doubt he thinks of islands , a few small cities clinging to rocks in the manner of Lorath or Lys , surrounded by stormy seas . The riches of the east must seem a more tempting prospect . ";Dany;;0.1125;12118;390
" But he must ride west , " Dany said , despairing . " Please , help me make him understand . ";Dany;;0.0;12119;390
" The Dothraki do things in their own time , for their own reasons , " the knight answered . " Have patience , Princess . Do not make your brother 's mistake . We will go home , I promise you . ";Dany;Dothraki,;0.6;12122;390
Ser Jorah must have seen the sadness on her face . " A great caravan arrived during the night , Khaleesi . Four hundred horses , from Pentos by way of Norvos and Qohor , under the command of Merchant Captain Byan Votyris . Illyrio may have sent a letter . Would you care to visit the Western Market ? ";Jorah;Illyrio,Market,;0.4;12129;391
Dany stirred . " Yes , " she said . " I would like that . ";Dany;Jorah,Valyria,;0.0;12130;391
You could never tell what treasures the traders might bring this time , and it would be good to hear men speaking Valyrian again , as they did in the Free Cities . " Irri , have them prepare a litter . ";Valyria;Jorah,Dany,;0.525;12132;391
" I shall tell your khas , " Ser Jorah said , withdrawing .;Jorah;Dany,Valyria,;0.0;12133;391
" When I was a little girl , I loved to play in the bazaar , " Dany told Ser Jorah as they wandered down the shady aisle between the stalls . " It was so alive there , all the people shouting and laughing , so many wonderful things to look at ... though we seldom had enough coin to buy anything ... well , except for a sausage now and again , or honeyfingers ... do they have honeyfingers in the Seven Kingdoms , the kind they bake in Tyrosh ? ";Dany;Jorah,Irri,;0.256327160494;12171;392
" Cakes , are they ? I could not say , Princess . ";Jorah;Dany,Irri,;0.0;12172;392
The knight bowed . " If you would pardon me for a time , I will seek out the captain and see if he has letters for us . ";Dany;Jorah,Irri,;0.0;12173;392
" Very well . I 'll help you find him . ";Jorah;Dany,Irri,;0.2;12174;392
" There is no need for you to trouble yourself . ";Dany;Jorah,Irri,;0.0;12175;392
Ser Jorah glanced away impatiently . " Enjoy the market . I will rejoin you when my business is concluded . ";Jorah;Dany,Irri,;0.4;12176;392
She gave a shrug . " Come , " she told the others .;Irri;Dany,Jorah,;0.0;12181;392
Her handmaids trailed along as Dany resumed her stroll through the market . " Oh , look , " she exclaimed to Doreah , " those are the kind of sausages I meant . ";Dany;Jorah,Irri,;0.6;12182;392
She pointed to a stall where a wizened little woman was grilling meat and onions on a hot firestone . " They make them with lots of garlic and hot peppers . ";Jorah;Dany,Irri,;0.104166666667;12183;392
Her handmaids wolfed theirs down giggling and grinning , though the men of her khas sniffed at the grilled meat suspiciously . " They taste different than I remember , " Dany said after her first few bites .;Dany;Jorah,Irri,;-0.0263888888889;12185;392
" In Pentos , I make them with pork , " the old woman said , " but all my pigs died on the Dothraki sea . These are made of horsemeat , Khaleesi , but I spice them the same . ";Jorah;Dany,Irri,;0.05;12186;392
" Oh. " Dany felt disappointed , but Quaro liked his sausage so well he decided to have another one , and Rakharo had to outdo him and eat three more , belching loudly .;Dany;Jorah,Irri,;0.116666666667;12187;392
" You have not laughed since your brother the Khal Rhaggat was crowned by Drogo , " said Irri . " It is good to see , Khaleesi . ";Irri;Rhaggat,;0.675;12189;392
Turning a corner , they came upon a wine merchant offering thimble-sized cups of his wares to the passersby . " Sweet reds , " he cried in fluent Dothraki , " I have sweet reds , from Lys and Volantis and the Arbor . Whites from Lys , Tyroshi pear brandy , firewine , pepperwine , the pale green nectars of Myr . Smokeberry browns and Andalish sours , I have them , I have them . ";Dothraki;Andal,;0.166666666667;12201;393
When Dany paused before his stall , he bowed low . " A taste for the khaleesi ? I have a sweet red from Dorne , my lady , it sings of plums and cherries and rich dark oak . A cask , a cup , a swallow ? One taste , and you will name your child after me . ";Dany;Dothraki,Doreah,Cities,Jorah,;0.115;12203;393
Dany smiled . " My son has his name , but I will try your summerwine , " she said in Valyrian , Valyrian as they spoke it in the Free Cities .;Dany;Dothraki,Doreah,Cities,Jorah,;0.5;12204;393
The words felt strange on her tongue , after so long . " Just a taste , if you would be so kind . ";Jorah;Dothraki,Dany,Doreah,Cities,;0.166666666667;12205;393
When she spoke , he gaped at her in astonishment . " My lady , you are ... Tyroshi ? Can it be so ? ";Doreah;Dothraki,Dany,Cities,Jorah,;0.0;12207;393
" My speech may be Tyroshi , and my garb Dothraki , but I am of Westeros , of the Sunset Kingdoms , " Dany told him .;Dany;Tyrosh,;0.0;12208;393
Doreah stepped up beside her . " You have the honor to address Daenerys of the House Targaryen , Daenerys Stormborn , khaleesi of the riding men and princess of the Seven Kingdoms . ";Doreah;Daenerys,;0.0;12209;393
The wine merchant dropped to his knees . " Princess , " he said , bowing his head .;Jorah;Dothraki,Dany,Doreah,Cities,;0.0;12210;393
" Rise , " Dany commanded him . " I would still like to taste that summerwine you spoke of . ";Dany;Dothraki,Doreah,Cities,Jorah,;0.0;12211;393
The man bounded to his feet . " That ? Dornish swill . It is not worthy of a princess . I have a dry red from the Arbor , crisp and delectable . Please , let me give you a cask . ";Jorah;Dothraki,Dany,Doreah,Cities,;0.129166666667;12212;393
Khal Drogo 's visits to the Free Cities had given him a taste for good wine , and Dany knew that such a noble vintage would please him . " You honor me , ser , " she murmured sweetly .;Cities;Dothraki,Dany,Doreah,Jorah,;0.4125;12213;393
" The honor is mine . ";Dany;Dothraki,Doreah,Cities,Jorah,;0.0;12214;393
Burned into the wood was a cluster of grapes . " The Redwyne sigil , " he said , pointing , " for the Arbor . There is no finer drink . ";Jorah;Dothraki,Dany,Doreah,Cities,;0.0;12216;393
" Khal Drogo and I will share it together . Aggo , take this back to my litter , if you'd be so kind . ";Dany;Dothraki,Doreah,Cities,Jorah,;0.3;12217;393
She did not realize that Ser Jorah had returned until she heard the knight say , " No . ";Jorah;Dothraki,Dany,Doreah,Cities,;0.0;12219;393
His voice was strange , brusque . " Aggo , put down that cask . ";Doreah;Dothraki,Dany,Cities,Jorah,;-0.102777777778;12220;393
She gave a hesitant nod . " Ser Jorah , is something wrong ? ";Dany;Dothraki,Doreah,Cities,Jorah,;-0.5;12222;393
" I have a thirst . Open it , wineseller . ";Jorah;Dothraki,Dany,Doreah,Cities,;0.0;12223;393
The merchant frowned . " The wine is for the khaleesi , not for the likes of you , ser . ";Dany;Dothraki,Doreah,Cities,Jorah,;0.0;12224;393
Ser Jorah moved closer to the stall . " If you do n't open it , I 'll crack it open with your head . ";Jorah;Dothraki,Dany,Doreah,Cities,;0.0;12225;393
" Pour , " Ser Jorah commanded .;Jorah;Dothraki,Dany,Doreah,Cities,;0.0;12228;393
" It would be a crime to drink this rich a wine without letting it breathe . ";Doreah;Dothraki,Dany,Cities,Jorah,;0.375;12230;393
Jhogo reached for the whip coiled at his belt , but Dany stopped him with a light touch on the arm . " Do as Ser Jorah says , " she said .;Dany;Jorah,;0.4;12232;393
The man gave her a quick , sullen glance . " As the princess commands . ";Doreah;Dothraki,Dany,Cities,Jorah,;0.333333333333;12234;393
" Sweet , is n't it ? ";Jorah;Dothraki,Dany,Doreah,Cities,;0.35;12238;393
the wineseller said , smiling . " Can you smell the fruit , ser ? The perfume of the Arbor . Taste it , my lord , and tell me it is n't the finest , richest wine that 's ever touched your tongue . ";Dany;Dothraki,Doreah,Cities,Jorah,;0.0;12239;393
Ser Jorah offered him the cup . " You taste it first . ";Jorah;Dothraki,Dany,Doreah,Cities,;0.25;12240;393
" Me ? ";Dany;Dothraki,Doreah,Cities,Jorah,;0.0;12241;393
The man laughed . " I am not worthy of this vintage , my lord . And it 's a poor wine merchant who drinks up his own wares . ";Jorah;Dothraki,Dany,Doreah,Cities,;0.308333333333;12242;393
" You will drink , " Dany said , cold as ice . " Empty the cup , or I will tell them to hold you down while Ser Jorah pours the whole cask down your throat . ";Dany;Jorah,;-0.162222222222;12244;393
Dany stumbled and lost her feet . " No , " she screamed , thrusting her hands out to break her fall ...;Dany;Dothraki,Doreah,Cities,Jorah,;0.0;12249;393
He seemed to know what had happened without a word being spoken . " Take this one away to await the pleasure of the khal , " he commanded , gesturing at the man on the ground .;Captain;Jorah,Dany,;0.0;12258;394
Two guards hauled the wineseller to his feet . " His goods I gift to you as well , Princess , " the merchant captain went on . " Small token of regret , that one of mine would do this thing . ";Jorah;Captain,Dany,;-0.25;12259;394
The poisoned wine was leaking from the broken cask into the dirt . " How did you know ? ";Captain;Jorah,Dany,;-0.4;12261;394
she asked Ser Jorah , trembling . " How ? ";Jorah;Captain,Dany,;0.0;12262;394
" I did not know , Khaleesi , not until the man refused to drink , but once I read Magister Illyrio 's letter , I feared . ";Captain;Illyrio,;0.0;12263;394
His dark eyes swept over the faces of the strangers in the market . " Come . Best not to talk of it here . ";Dany;Captain,Jorah,;0.425;12264;394
Dany stroked the swell of her belly gently , wishing she could reach him , touch him , soothe him . " You are the blood of the dragon , little one , " she whispered as her litter swayed along , curtains drawn tight . " You are the blood of the dragon , and the dragon does not fear . ";Dany;Jorah,;-0.183035714286;12271;395
Under the hollow hummock of earth that was her home in Vaes Dothrak , Dany ordered them to leave her-all but Ser Jorah . " Tell me , " she commanded as she lowered herself onto her cushions . " Was it the Usurper ? ";Dany;Usurper,;0.0;12272;395
" Yes . ";Dany;Jorah,;0.0;12273;395
The knight drew out a folded parchment . " A letter to Viserys , from Magister Illyrio . Robert Baratheon offers lands and lordships for your death , or your brother ' s. ";Dany;Robert,;0.1;12274;395
" My brother ? ";Dany;Jorah,;0.0;12275;395
Her sob was half a laugh . " He does not know yet , does he ? The Usurper owes Drogo a lordship . ";Dany;Usurper,;0.0666666666667;12276;395
She hugged herself protectively . " And me , you said . Only me ? ";Dany;Jorah,;0.0;12278;395
" You and the child , " Ser Jorah said , grim .;Jorah;Dany,;-1.0;12279;395
" No . He cannot have my son . ";Dany;Jorah,;0.0;12280;395
She heard her own voice saying , " Ser Jorah , light the brazier . ";Dany;;0.5;12289;396
" Khaleesi ? ";Dany;;0.0;12290;396
The knight looked at her strangely . " It is so hot . Are you certain ? ";Dany;;0.232142857143;12291;396
She had never been so certain . " Yes . I ... I have a chill . Light the brazier . ";Dany;;0.307142857143;12292;396
He bowed . " As you command . ";Dany;;0.0;12293;396
The khal laughed as he swung down off his stallion and showed her the scars on his leg where the hrakkar had raked him through his leggings . " I shall make you a cloak of its skin , moon of my life , " he swore .;khal;Jorah,Drogo,;0.272222222222;12317;397
" This poisoner was the first , " Ser Jorah Mormont warned him , " but he will not be the last . Men will risk much for a lordship . ";Jorah;khal,Drogo,;0.116666666667;12319;397
Finally he said , " This seller of poisons ran from the moon of my life . Better he should run after her . So he will . Jhogo , Jorah the Andal , to each of you I say , choose any horse you wish from my herds , and it is yours . Any horse save my red and the silver that was my bride gift to the moon of my life . I make this gift to you for what you did .;Drogo;khal,Jorah,;0.25;12321;397
" And to Rhaego son of Drogo , the stallion who will mount the world , to him I also pledge a gift . To him I will give this iron chair his mother 's father sat in . I will give him Seven Kingdoms . I , Drogo , khal , will do this thing . ";Jorah;khal,Drogo,;0.0;12322;397
His voice rose , and he lifted his fist to the sky . " I will take my khalasar west to where the world ends , and ride the wooden horses across the black salt water as no khal has done before . I will kill the men in the iron suits and tear down their stone houses . I will rape their women , take their children as slaves , and bring their broken gods back to Vaes Dothrak to bow down beneath the Mother of Mountains . This I vow , I , Drogo son of Bharbo . This I swear before the Mother of Mountains , as the stars look down in witness . ";Drogo;khal,Jorah,;-0.0541666666667;12323;397
" They await our coming , my lady , " Ser Wylis Manderly said , " as my lord father swore they would . ";Wyl;Catelyn,;0.0;12338;398
" Let us not keep them waiting any longer , ser . ";Wyl;Catelyn,;0.0;12339;398
A man of near sixty years , he had grown too stout to sit a horse . " If I had thought to see war again in my lifetime , I should have eaten a few less eels , " he'd told Catelyn when he met her ship , slapping his massive belly with both hands .;Catelyn;Wyl,;-0.0666666666667;12344;398
His fingers were fat as sausages . " My boys will see you safe to your son , though , have no fear . ";Wyl;Catelyn,;0.5;12345;398
His " boys " were both older than Catelyn , and she might have wished that they did not take after their father quite so closely .;Catelyn;Wyl,;0.166666666667;12346;398
" Gods have mercy , " Ser Brynden exclaimed when he saw what lay before them . " This is Moat Cailin ? It 's no more than a - ";Brynden;Gods,Cailin,;0.5;12377;399
" - death trap , " Catelyn finished . " I know how it looks , Uncle . I thought the same the first time I saw it , but Ned assured me that this ruin is more formidable than it seems . The three surviving towers command the causeway from all sides , and any enemy must pass between them . The bogs here are impenetrable , full of quicksands and suckholes and teeming with snakes . To assault any of the towers , an army would need to wade through waist-deep black muck , cross a moat full of lizard-lions , and scale walls slimy with moss , all the while exposing themselves to fire from archers in the other towers . ";Catelyn;Ned,;0.144791666667;12378;399
She gave her uncle a grim smile . " And when night falls , there are said to be ghosts , cold vengeful spirits of the north who hunger for southron blood . ";Brynden;Catelyn,;-0.433333333333;12379;399
Ser Brynden chuckled . " Remind me not to linger here . Last I looked , I was southron myself . ";Brynden;Catelyn,;0.0;12380;399
The lords fell silent one by one , and Robb looked up at the sudden quiet and saw her . " Mother ! ";Robb;;0.0;12391;400
It seemed bigger than a wolf ought to be . " You 've grown a beard , " she said to Robb , while Grey Wind sniffed her hand .;Greyjoy;Catelyn,Tallhart,Robb,Greatjon,Lysa,Sansa,Jaime,;-0.025;12398;401
He rubbed his stubbled jaw , suddenly awkward . " Yes . ";Robb;Greyjoy,Catelyn,Tallhart,Greatjon,Lysa,Sansa,Jaime,;-0.6;12399;401
" I like it . ";Greyjoy;Catelyn,Tallhart,Robb,Greatjon,Lysa,Sansa,Jaime,;0.0;12401;401
Catelyn stroked the wolf 's head , gently . " It makes you look like my brother Edmure . ";Catelyn;Greyjoy,Tallhart,Robb,Greatjon,Lysa,Sansa,Jaime,;0.0;12402;401
Ser Helman Tallhart was the first to follow the direwolf across the room to pay his respects , kneeling before her and pressing his brow to her hand . " Lady Catelyn , " he said , " you are fair as ever , a welcome sight in troubled times . ";Tallhart;Greyjoy,Catelyn,Robb,Greatjon,Lysa,Sansa,Jaime,;0.3125;12404;401
Theon Greyjoy was the last . " I had not looked to see you here , my lady , " he said as he knelt .;Greyjoy;Catelyn,Tallhart,Robb,Greatjon,Lysa,Sansa,Jaime,;0.0;12406;401
" I had not thought to be here , " Catelyn said , " until I came ashore at White Harbor , and Lord Wyman told me that Robb had called the banners . You know his son , Ser Wendel , " Wendel Manderly stepped forward and bowed as low as his girth would allow . " And my uncle , Ser Brynden Tully , who has left my sister 's service for mine . ";Catelyn;Lord,Robb,;0.0;12407;401
" The Blackfish , " Robb said . " Thank you for joining us , ser . We need men of your courage . And you , Ser Wendel , I am glad to have you here . Is Ser Rodrik with you as well , Mother ? I 've missed him . ";Robb;Rodrik,;0.5;12408;401
" Ser Rodrik is on his way north from White Harbor . I have named him castellan and commanded him to hold Winterfell till our return . Maester Luwin is a wise counsellor , but unskilled in the arts of war . ";Catelyn;Rodrik,Maester,Winterfell,;0.35;12409;401
" Have no fear on that count , Lady Stark , " the Greatjon told her in his bass rumble . " Winterfell is safe . We 'll shove our swords up Tywin Lannister 's bunghole soon enough , begging your pardons , and then it 's on to the Red Keep to free Ned . ";Greatjon;Winterfell,Ned,;0.0916666666667;12410;401
" My lady , a question , as it please you . ";Robb;Greyjoy,Catelyn,Tallhart,Greatjon,Lysa,Sansa,Jaime,;0.0;12411;401
His eyes were curiously pale , almost without color , and his look disturbing . " It is said that you hold Lord Tywin 's dwarf son as captive . Have you brought him to us ? I vow , we should make good use of such a hostage . ";Greyjoy;Lord,;0.0875;12413;401
" I did hold Tyrion Lannister , but no longer , " Catelyn was forced to admit .;Catelyn;Tyrion,;-0.3;12414;401
A chorus of consternation greeted the news . " I was no more pleased than you , my lords . The gods saw fit to free him , with some help from my fool of a sister . ";Robb;Greyjoy,Catelyn,Tallhart,Greatjon,Lysa,Sansa,Jaime,;0.45;12415;401
Lysa 's rage had been frightening to behold . " Sister or no , " she had replied , " if you try to steal my son , you will leave by the Moon Door . ";Lysa;Greyjoy,Catelyn,Tallhart,Robb,Greatjon,Sansa,Jaime,;-0.5;12419;401
The lords were anxious to question her further , but Catelyn raised a hand . " No doubt we will have time for all this later , but my journey has fatigued me . I would speak with my son alone . I know you will forgive me , my lords . ";Catelyn;Greyjoy,Tallhart,Robb,Greatjon,Lysa,Sansa,Jaime,;-0.0833333333333;12421;401
She gave them no choice ; led by the ever-obliging Lord Hornwood , the bannermen bowed and took their leave . " And you , Theon , " she added when Greyjoy lingered .;Greyjoy;Catelyn,Tallhart,Robb,Greatjon,Lysa,Sansa,Jaime,;0.0;12422;401
He seemed taller than when she'd left , and the wisps of beard did make him look older . " Edmure was sixteen when he grew his first whiskers . ";Catelyn;Edmure,;0.138888888889;12426;401
" I will be sixteen soon enough , " Robb said .;Robb;Greyjoy,Catelyn,Tallhart,Greatjon,Lysa,Sansa,Jaime,;0.0;12427;401
" And you are fifteen now . Fifteen , and leading a host to battle . Can you understand why I might fear , Robb ? ";Catelyn;Greyjoy,Tallhart,Robb,Greatjon,Lysa,Sansa,Jaime,;0.0;12428;401
His look grew stubborn . " There was no one else . ";Robb;Greyjoy,Catelyn,Tallhart,Greatjon,Lysa,Sansa,Jaime,;0.0;12429;401
" No one ? ";Catelyn;Greyjoy,Tallhart,Robb,Greatjon,Lysa,Sansa,Jaime,;0.0;12430;401
she said . " Pray , who were those men I saw here a moment ago ? Roose Bolton , Rickard Karstark , Galbart and Robett Glover , the Greatjon , Helman Tallhart ... you might have given the command to any of them . Gods be good , you might even have sent Theon , though he would not be my choice . ";Robb;Gods,Theon,;0.65;12431;401
" They are not Starks , " he said .;Catelyn;Greyjoy,Tallhart,Robb,Greatjon,Lysa,Sansa,Jaime,;0.0;12432;401
" They are men , Robb , seasoned in battle . You were fighting with wooden swords less than a year past . ";Robb;Greyjoy,Catelyn,Tallhart,Greatjon,Lysa,Sansa,Jaime,;-0.0416666666667;12433;401
She saw anger in his eyes at that , but it was gone as quick as it came , and suddenly he was a boy again . " I know , " he said , abashed . " Are you ... are you sending me back to Winterfell ? ";Greyjoy;Catelyn,Tallhart,Robb,Greatjon,Lysa,Sansa,Jaime,;-0.122222222222;12434;401
Catelyn sighed . " I should . You ought never have left . Yet I dare not , not now . You have come too far . Someday these lords will look to you as their liege . If I pack you off now , like a child being sent to bed without his supper , they will remember , and laugh about it in their cups . The day will come when you need them to respect you , even fear you a little . Laughter is poison to fear . I will not do that to you , much as I might wish to keep you safe . ";Catelyn;Greyjoy,Tallhart,Robb,Greatjon,Lysa,Sansa,Jaime,;0.135416666667;12435;401
" You have my thanks , Mother , " he said , his relief obvious beneath the formality .;Robb;Greyjoy,Catelyn,Tallhart,Greatjon,Lysa,Sansa,Jaime,;0.1;12436;401
She reached across his table and touched his hair . " You are my firstborn , Robb . I have only to look at you to remember the day you came into the world , red-faced and squalling . ";Catelyn;Greyjoy,Tallhart,Robb,Greatjon,Lysa,Sansa,Jaime,;0.0;12437;401
Grey Wind rubbed his head against his leg . " You know ... about Father ? ";Greyjoy;Catelyn,Tallhart,Robb,Greatjon,Lysa,Sansa,Jaime,;-0.05;12439;401
" Yes . ";Robb;Greyjoy,Catelyn,Tallhart,Greatjon,Lysa,Sansa,Jaime,;0.0;12440;401
The reports of Robert 's sudden death and Ned 's fall had frightened Catelyn more than she could say , but she would not let her son see her fear . " Lord Manderly told me when I landed at White Harbor . Have you had any word of your sisters ? ";Catelyn;Lord,;0.166666666667;12441;401
" There was a letter , " Robb said , scratching his direwolf under the jaw . " One for you as well , but it came to Winterfell with mine . ";Robb;Greyjoy,Catelyn,Tallhart,Greatjon,Lysa,Sansa,Jaime,;0.0;12442;401
He went to the table , rummaged among some maps and papers , and returned with a crumpled parchment . " This is the one she wrote me , I never thought to bring yours . ";Catelyn;Greyjoy,Tallhart,Robb,Greatjon,Lysa,Sansa,Jaime,;0.0;12443;401
Concern gave way to disbelief , then to anger , and lastly to fear . " This is Cersei 's letter , not your sister ' s , " she said when she was done . " The real message is in what Sansa does not say . All this about how kindly and gently the Lannisters are treating her ... I know the sound of a threat , even whispered . They have Sansa hostage , and they mean to keep her . ";Greyjoy;Cersei,Sansa,;-0.128125;12446;401
" There 's no mention of Arya , " Robb pointed out , miserable .;Robb;Greyjoy,Catelyn,Tallhart,Greatjon,Lysa,Sansa,Jaime,;-1.0;12447;401
" No . ";Catelyn;Greyjoy,Tallhart,Robb,Greatjon,Lysa,Sansa,Jaime,;0.0;12448;401
" I had hoped ... if you still held the Imp , a trade of hostages ... ";Robb;Imp,;0.0;12450;401
He took Sansa 's letter and crumpled it in his fist , and she could tell from the way he did it that it was not the first time . " Is there word from the Eyrie ? I wrote to Aunt Lysa , asking help . Has she called Lord Arryn 's banners , do you know ? Will the knights of the Vale come join us ? ";Sansa;Lord,;0.25;12451;401
" Only one , " she said , " the best of them , my uncle ... but Brynden Blackfish was a Tully first . My sister is not about to stir beyond her Bloody Gate . ";Catelyn;Black,Tully,;0.1125;12452;401
Robb took it hard . " Mother , what are we going to do ? I brought this whole army together , eighteen thousand men , but I do n't ... I 'm not certain ... ";Robb;Greyjoy,Catelyn,Tallhart,Greatjon,Lysa,Sansa,Jaime,;0.040873015873;12453;401
" What are you so afraid of , Robb ? ";Catelyn;Greyjoy,Tallhart,Robb,Greatjon,Lysa,Sansa,Jaime,;-0.6;12456;401
" I ... ";Robb;Greyjoy,Catelyn,Tallhart,Greatjon,Lysa,Sansa,Jaime,;0.0;12458;401
He turned his head away , to hide the first tear . " If we march ... even if we win ... the Lannisters hold Sansa , and Father . They 'll kill them , wo n't they ? ";Catelyn;Greyjoy,Tallhart,Robb,Greatjon,Lysa,Sansa,Jaime,;0.525;12459;401
" They want us to think so . ";Robb;Greyjoy,Catelyn,Tallhart,Greatjon,Lysa,Sansa,Jaime,;0.0;12460;401
" You mean they 're lying ? ";Catelyn;Greyjoy,Tallhart,Robb,Greatjon,Lysa,Sansa,Jaime,;-0.3125;12461;401
" I do not know , Robb . What I do know is that you have no choice . If you go to King 's Landing and swear fealty , you will never be allowed to leave . If you turn your tail and retreat to Winterfell , your lords will lose all respect for you . Some may even go over to the Lannisters . Then the queen , with that much less to fear , can do as she likes with her prisoners . Our best hope , our only true hope , is that you can defeat the foe in the field . If you should chance to take Lord Tywin or the Kingslayer captive , why then a trade might very well be possible , but that is not the heart of it . So long as you have power enough that they must fear you , Ned and your sister should be safe . Cersei is wise enough to know that she may need them to make her peace , should the fighting go against her . ";Robb;Cersei,King,;0.227777777778;12462;401
" What if the fighting does n't go against her ? ";Catelyn;Greyjoy,Tallhart,Robb,Greatjon,Lysa,Sansa,Jaime,;0.0;12463;401
Robb asked . " What if it goes against us ? ";Robb;Greyjoy,Catelyn,Tallhart,Greatjon,Lysa,Sansa,Jaime,;0.0;12464;401
Catelyn took his hand . " Robb , I will not soften the truth for you . If you lose , there is no hope for any of us . They say there is naught but stone at the heart of Casterly Rock . Remember the fate of Rhaegar 's children . ";Catelyn;Greyjoy,Tallhart,Robb,Greatjon,Lysa,Sansa,Jaime,;0.0;12465;401
She saw the fear in his young eyes then , but there was a strength as well . " Then I will not lose , " he vowed .;Robb;Greyjoy,Catelyn,Tallhart,Greatjon,Lysa,Sansa,Jaime,;0.1;12466;401
" Tell me what you know of the fighting in the riverlands , " she said .;Catelyn;Greyjoy,Tallhart,Robb,Greatjon,Lysa,Sansa,Jaime,;0.0;12467;401
" Less than a fortnight past , they fought a battle in the hills below the Golden Tooth , " Robb said . " Uncle Edmure had sent Lord Vance and Lord Piper to hold the pass , but the Kingslayer descended on them and put them to flight . Lord Vance was slain . The last word we had was that Lord Piper was falling back to join your brother and his other bannermen at Riverrun , with Jaime Lannister on his heels . That 's not the worst of it , though . All the time they were battling in the pass , Lord Tywin was bringing a second Lannister army around from the south . It 's said to be even larger than Jaime 's host .;Robb;Edmure,Lord,Marq,;-0.137962962963;12469;401
" Father must have known that , because he sent out some men to oppose them , under the king 's own banner . He gave the command to some southron lordling , Lord Erik or Derik or something like that , but Ser Raymun Darry rode with him , and the letter said there were other knights as well , and a force of Father 's own guardsmen . Only it was a trap . Lord Derik had no sooner crossed the Red Fork than the Lannisters fell upon him , the king 's banner be damned , and Gregor Clegane took them in the rear as they tried to pull back across the Mummer 's Ford . This Lord Derik and a few others may have escaped , no one is certain , but Ser Raymun was killed , and most of our men from Winterfell . Lord Tywin has closed off the kingsroad , it 's said , and now he 's marching north toward Harrenhal , burning as he goes . ";Catelyn;Father,Serrett,Lord,Clegane,Raymun,Redwyne,;0.148928571429;12470;401
It was worse than she'd imagined . " You mean to meet him here ? ";Greyjoy;Catelyn,Tallhart,Robb,Greatjon,Lysa,Sansa,Jaime,;-0.35625;12472;401
" If he comes so far , but no one thinks he will , " Robb said . " I 've sent word to Howland Reed , Father 's old friend at Greywater Watch . If the Lannisters come up the Neck , the crannogmen will bleed them every step of the way , but Galbart Glover says Lord Tywin is too smart for that , and Roose Bolton agrees . He 'll stay close to the Trident , they believe , taking the castles of the river lords one by one , until Riverrun stands alone . We need to march south to meet him . ";Robb;Glover,Bolton,Riverrun,Lord,;0.138095238095;12474;401
What chance would a fifteen-year-old boy have against seasoned battle commanders like Jaime and Tywin Lannister ? " Is that wise ? You are strongly placed here . It 's said that the old Kings in the North could stand at Moat Cailin and throw back hosts ten times the size of their own . ";Jaime;North,;0.275;12476;401
" Yes , but our food and supplies are running low , and this is not land we can live off easily . We 've been waiting for Lord Manderly , but now that his sons have joined us , we need to march . ";Robb;Greyjoy,Catelyn,Tallhart,Greatjon,Lysa,Sansa,Jaime,;0.0681818181818;12477;401
but not forever . " Marching is all very well , " she said to her son , " but where , and to what purpose ? What do you mean to do ? ";Catelyn;Marches,;-0.05625;12486;402
Robb hesitated . " The Greatjon thinks we should take the battle to Lord Tywin and surprise him , " he said , " but the Glovers and the Karstarks feel we'd be wiser to go around his army and join up with Uncle Ser Edmure against the Kingslayer . ";Robb;Greatjon,;0.0;12487;402
He ran his fingers through his shaggy mane of auburn hair , looking unhappy . " Though by the time we reach Riverrun ... I 'm not certain ... ";Ned;Riverrun,;-0.192857142857;12488;402
" Be certain , " Catelyn told her son , " or go home and take up that wooden sword again . You cannot afford to seem indecisive in front of men like Roose Bolton and Rickard Karstark . Make no mistake , Robb-these are your bannermen , not your friends . You named yourself battle commander . Command . ";Catelyn;Robb,;0.107142857143;12489;402
Her son looked at her , startled , as if he could not credit what he was hearing . " As you say , Mother . ";Ned;Robb,Catelyn,;0.0;12490;402
" I 'll ask you again . What do you mean to do ? ";Robb;Catelyn,Ned,;-0.3125;12491;402
One end curled up from being rolled ; he weighed it down with his dagger . " Both plans have virtues , but ... look , if we try to swing around Lord Tywin 's host , we take the risk of being caught between him and the Kingslayer , and if we attack him ... by all reports , he has more men than I do , and a lot more armored horse . The Greatjon says that wo n't matter if we catch him with his breeches down , but it seems to me that a man who has fought as many battles as Tywin Lannister wo n't be so easily surprised . ";Catelyn;Greatjon,Lannister,;0.214814814815;12493;402
" Good , " she said .;Robb;Catelyn,Ned,;0.65;12494;402
She could hear echoes of Ned in his voice , as he sat there , puzzling over the map . " Tell me more . ";Ned;Robb,Catelyn,;0.5;12495;402
" I'd leave a small force here to hold Moat Cailin , archers mostly , and march the rest down the causeway , " he said , " but once we 're below the Neck , I'd split our host in two . The foot can continue down the kingsroad , while our horsemen cross the Green Fork at the Twins . ";Robb;I'd,Cailin,;-0.152222222222;12496;402
He pointed . " When Lord Tywin gets word that we 've come south , he 'll march north to engage our main host , leaving our riders free to hurry down the west bank to Riverrun . ";Ned;Lord,;0.137037037037;12497;402
Catelyn frowned down at the map . " You'd put a river between the two parts of your army . ";Catelyn;You'd,;-0.155555555556;12499;402
" And between Jaime and Lord Tywin , " he said eagerly .;Robb;Catelyn,Ned,;0.0;12500;402
The smile came at last . " There 's no crossing on the Green Fork above the ruby ford , where Robert won his crown . Not until the Twins , all the way up here , and Lord Frey controls that bridge . He 's your father 's bannerman , is n't that so ? ";Ned;Robert,;0.025;12501;402
The Late Lord Frey , Catelyn thought . " He is , " she admitted , " but my father has never trusted him . Nor should you . ";Catelyn;Robb,Ned,;-0.3;12502;402
" I wo n't , " Robb promised . " What do you think ? ";Robb;Catelyn,Ned,;0.0;12503;402
He looks like a Tully , she thought , yet he 's still his father 's son , and Ned taught him well . " Which force would you command ? ";Ned;Robb,Catelyn,;0.0;12505;402
" The horse , " he answered at once .;Robb;Catelyn,Ned,;0.0;12506;402
" And the other ? ";Ned;Robb,Catelyn,;-0.125;12508;402
" The Greatjon is always saying that we should smash Lord Tywin . I thought I'd give him the honor . ";Robb;Greatjon,I'd,;0.0;12509;402
It was his first misstep , but how to make him see it without wounding his fledgling confidence ? " Your father once told me that the Greatjon was as fearless as any man he had ever known . ";Catelyn;Greatjon,;0.25;12510;402
Robb grinned . " Grey Wind ate two of his fingers , and he laughed about it . So you agree , then ? ";Robb;Greyjoy,;0.325;12511;402
" Your father is not fearless , " Catelyn pointed out . " He is brave , but that is very different . ";Catelyn;Robb,Ned,;0.4;12512;402
Her son considered that for a moment . " The eastern host will be all that stands between Lord Tywin and Winterfell , " he said thoughtfully . " Well , them and whatever few bowmen I leave here at the Moat . So I do n't want someone fearless , do I ? ";Robb;Catelyn,Ned,;-0.2;12513;402
" No . You want cold cunning , I should think , not courage . ";Catelyn;Robb,Ned,;-0.3;12514;402
" Roose Bolton , " Robb said at once . " That man scares me . ";Robb;Catelyn,Ned,;0.0;12515;402
" Then let us pray he will scare Tywin Lannister as well . ";Catelyn;Lannister,;0.0;12516;402
Robb nodded and rolled up the map . " I 'll give the commands , and assemble an escort to take you home to Winterfell . ";Robb;Catelyn,Ned,;0.0;12517;402

" Best for Tyrion son of Tywin , " said Ulf , who spoke for the Moon Brothers .;Ulf;Cheyk,Tyrion,Shagga,Chella,;1.0;12535;403
Shagga glowered , a fearsome sight to see . " Shagga son of Dolf likes this not . Shagga will go with the boyman , and if the boyman lies , Shagga will chop off his manhood - ";Shagga;Dolf,Shagga,;0.0;12536;403

" By my lights , it was you who started this , " Lord Tywin replied . " Your brother Jaime would never have meekly submitted to capture at the hands of a woman . ";Lord;Jaime,;0.0;12626;408

" No matter , " Lord Tywin said . " Frey only takes the field when the scent of victory is in the air , and all he smells now is ruin . And Jason Mallister lacks the strength to fight alone .

" I would not fret overmuch about the Arryns if I were you , " Tyrion said . " The Starks are another matter . Lord Eddard - ";Tyrion;Stark,;0.0;12644;408

" No sword is strong until it 's been tempered , " Lord Tywin declared . " The Stark boy is a child .

Lord Tywin did not seem awed . " We also have a pair of Ned Stark 's afterthoughts making a nuisance of themselves by harassing my foraging parties .

Tyrion wiped his mouth with the back of his hand and smiled . " Father , it warms my heart to think that you might entrust me with ... what , twenty men ? Fifty ? Are you sure you can spare so many ?

The new-made lord , Janos Slynt , spoke up , his voice heavy and blunt . " Her Grace is trying to tell you that you are relieved as Lord Commander of the Kingsguard . ";Slynt;Grace,;-0.2;12807;412
The tall , white-haired knight seemed to shrink as he stood there , scarcely breathing . " Your Grace , " he said at last . " The Kingsguard is a Sworn Brotherhood . Our vows are taken for life .

She had never seen him look his years before , yet now he did . " Your Grace , " he said . " I was chosen for the White Swords in my twenty-third year . It was all I had ever dreamed , from the moment I first took sword in hand . I gave up all claim to my ancestral keep . The girl I was to wed married my cousin in my place , I had no need of land or sons , my life would be lived for the realm .

Lord Varys spoke , gentler than the others . " We are not unmindful of your service , good ser .

Ser Boros and Ser Meryn moved forward to confront him , but Ser Barristan froze them in place with a look that dripped contempt . " Have no fear , sers , your king is safe ... no thanks to you .

Not until the pages had closed the great oak-and-bronze doors behind him did Sansa hear sounds again : soft voices , uneasy stirrings , the shuffle of papers from the council table .

He touched the man 's face . " I 'm not ... not dreaming this . You 're here . ";Ned;Varys,;0.0;13016;419

" The younger girl escaped Ser Meryn and fled , " Varys told him . " I have not been able to find her . Nor have the Lannisters . A kindness , there . Our new king loves her not .

" And would again . I seem to recall that I was unarmed , unarmored , and surrounded by Lannister swords . ";Ned;Varys,;0.0;13037;419
The eunuch looked at him curiously , tilting his head . " When I was a young boy , before I was cut , I traveled with a troupe of mummers through the Free Cities . They taught me that each man has a role to play , in life as well as mummery . So it is at court . The King 's Justice must be fearsome , the master of coin must be frugal , the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard must be valiant ... and the master of whisperers must be sly and obsequious and without scruple .

This time it went down easier . " Can you free me from this pit ? ";Ned;Varys,;0.122222222222;13042;419

" A eunuch has no honor , and a spider does not enjoy the luxury of scruples , my lord . ";Ned;Varys,;0.4;13045;419
" Would you at least consent to carry a message out for me ? ";Ned;Varys,;-0.3;13046;419
" That would depend on the message . I will gladly provide you with paper and ink , if you like . And when you have written what you will , I will take the letter and read it , and deliver it or not , as best serves my own ends . ";Ned;Varys,;0.8;13047;419
" Your own ends . What ends are those , Lord Varys ? ";Ned;Varys,;0.6;13048;419
" Peace , " Varys replied without hesitation . " If there was one soul in King 's Landing who was truly desperate to keep Robert Baratheon alive , it was me . ";Varys;Robert,;-0.25;13049;419
He sighed . " For fifteen years I protected him from his enemies , but I could not protect him from his friends . What strange fit of madness led you to tell the queen that you had learned the truth of Joffrey 's birth ? ";Ned;Varys,;0.175;13050;419
" The madness of mercy , " Ned admitted .;Ned;Varys,;0.0;13051;419
" Ah , " said Varys . " To be sure . You are an honest and honorable man , Lord Eddard . Ofttimes I forget that . I have met so few of them in my life . ";Varys;Ned,;0.3;13052;419
He glanced around the cell . " When I see what honesty and honor have won you , I understand why . ";Ned;Varys,;0.0;13053;419
His leg was throbbing . " The king 's wine ... did you question Lancel ? ";Ned;Lance,;0.0;13055;419
" Oh , indeed . Cersei gave him the wineskins , and told him it was Robert 's favorite vintage . ";Ned;Cersei,Robert,;0.5;13056;419
The eunuch shrugged . " A hunter lives a perilous life . If the boar had not done for Robert , it would have been a fall from a horse , the bite of a wood adder , an arrow gone astray ... the forest is the abbatoir of the gods . It was not wine that killed the king . It was your mercy . ";Ned;Varys,;0.0;13057;419
Ned had feared as much . " Gods forgive me . ";Ned;Gods,;0.1;13058;419
" If there are gods , " Varys said , " I expect they will . The queen would not have waited long in any case . Robert was becoming unruly , and she needed to be rid of him to free her hands to deal with his brothers . They are quite a pair , Stannis and Renly . The iron gauntlet and the silk glove .

" How ... how could you know of that ? ";Ned;Varys,;0.0;13061;419
Varys smiled . " I know , that 's all that need concern you . I also know that on the morrow the queen will pay you a visit . ";Varys;Ned,;0.6;13062;419
Slowly Ned raised his eyes . " Why ? ";Ned;Varys,;0.0;13063;419
" Cersei is frightened of you , my lord ... but she has other enemies she fears even more . Her beloved Jaime is fighting the river lords even now . Lysa Arryn sits in the Eyrie , ringed in stone and steel , and there is no love lost between her and the queen . In Dorne , the Martells still brood on the murder of Princess Elia and her babes . And now your son marches down the Neck with a northern host at his back . ";Ned;Cersei,Jaime,still,;0.236574074074;13064;419
" Robb is only a boy , " Ned said , aghast .;Ned;Robb,;-0.3;13065;419
" A boy with an army , " Varys said . " Yet only a boy , as you say . The king 's brothers are the ones giving Cersei sleepless nights ... Lord Stannis in particular . His claim is the true one , he is known for his prowess as a battle commander , and he is utterly without mercy . There is no creature on earth half so terrifying as a truly just man . No one knows what Stannis has been doing on Dragonstone , but I will wager you that he 's gathered more swords than seashells . So here is Cersei 's nightmare : while her father and brother spend their power battling Starks and Tullys , Lord Stannis will land , proclaim himself king , and lop off her son 's curly blond head ... and her own in the bargain , though I truly believe she cares more about the boy . ";Varys;Stannis,Lord,Cersei,;0.11875;13066;419
" Stannis Baratheon is Robert 's true heir , " Ned said . " The throne is his by rights . I would welcome his ascent . ";Ned;Stannis,;0.575;13067;419
Varys tsked . " Cersei will not want to hear that , I promise you . Stannis may win the throne , but only your rotting head will remain to cheer unless you guard that tongue of yours . Sansa begged so sweetly , it would be a shame if you threw it all away . You are being given your life back , if you 'll take it . Cersei is no fool . She knows a tame wolf is of more use than a dead one . ";Varys;Cersei,Stannis,Sansa,;0.22;13068;419
" You want me to serve the woman who murdered my king , butchered my men , and crippled my son ? ";Ned;Varys,;0.0;13069;419
" I want you to serve the realm , " Varys said . " Tell the queen that you will confess your vile treason , command your son to lay down his sword , and proclaim Joffrey as the true heir . Offer to denounce Stannis and Renly as faithless usurpers . Our green-eyed lioness knows you are a man of honor . If you will give her the peace she needs and the time to deal with Stannis , and pledge to carry her secret to your grave , I believe she will allow you to take the black and live out the rest of your days on the Wall , with your brother and that baseborn son of yours . ";Varys;Joffrey,;-0.0471717171717;13071;419
He winced , his fingers opening and closing helplessly . " Is this your own scheme , " he gasped out at Varys , " or are you in league with Littlefinger ? ";Varys;Ned,;0.6;13075;419
That seemed to amuse the eunuch . " I would sooner wed the Black Goat of Qohor . Littlefinger is the second most devious man in the Seven Kingdoms . Oh , I feed him choice whispers , sufficient so that he thinks I am his ... just as I allow Cersei to believe I am hers . ";Ned;Littlefinger,Cersei,;0.111111111111;13076;419
" And just as you let me believe that you were mine . Tell me , Lord Varys , who do you truly serve ? ";Ned;Varys,;0.0;13077;419
Varys smiled thinly . " Why , the realm , my good lord , how ever could you doubt that ? I swear it by my lost manhood . I serve the realm , and the realm needs peace . ";Varys;Ned,;0.625;13078;419
He finished the last swallow of wine , and tossed the empty skin aside . " So what is your answer , Lord Eddard ? Give me your word that you 'll tell the queen what she wants to hear when she comes calling . ";Ned;Varys,;0.0333333333333;13079;419
" If I did , my word would be as hollow as an empty suit of armor . My life is not so precious to me as that . ";Ned;Varys,;0.2;13080;419
" Pity . ";Ned;Varys,;0.0;13081;419
The eunuch stood . " And your daughter 's life , my lord ? How precious is that ? ";Ned;Varys,;0.5;13082;419
A chill pierced Ned 's heart . " My daughter ... ";Ned;Varys,;0.0;13083;419
" Surely you did not think I'd forgotten about your sweet innocent , my lord ? The queen most certainly has not . ";Ned;I'd,;0.45;13084;419
" No , " Ned pleaded , his voice cracking . " Varys , gods have mercy , do as you like with me , but leave my daughter out of your schemes . Sansa 's no more than a child . ";Ned;Sansa,;0.5;13085;419
" Rhaenys was a child too . Prince Rhaegar 's daughter . A precious little thing , younger than your girls . She had a small black kitten she called Balerion , did you know ? I always wondered what happened to him . Rhaenys liked to pretend he was the true Balerion , the Black Dread of old , but I imagine the Lannisters taught her the difference between a kitten and a dragon quick enough , the day they broke down her door . ";Ned;Rhaenys,Lannister,Balerion,;0.0797453703704;13086;419
Varys gave a long weary sigh , the sigh of a man who carried all the sadness of the world in a sack upon his shoulders . " The High Septon once told me that as we sin , so do we suffer . If that 's true , Lord Eddard , tell me ... why is it always the innocents who suffer most , when you high lords play your game of thrones ? Ponder it , if you would , while you wait upon the queen . And spare a thought for this as well : The next visitor who calls on you could bring you bread and cheese and the milk of the poppy for your pain ... or he could bring you Sansa 's head .;Varys;High,Sansa,;0.102857142857;13087;419
" The choice , my dear lord Hand , is entirely yours . ";Ned;Varys,;0.0;13088;419
" Late again , " Catelyn murmured when she heard .;Catelyn;Robb,Greyjoy,Theon,Black,Knight,Brynden,;-0.3;13110;420
" Four thousand men , " Robb repeated , more perplexed than angry . " Lord Frey cannot hope to fight the Lannisters by himself . Surely he means to join his power to ours . ";Robb;Lord,Lannister,;0.133333333333;13113;420
" Does he ? ";Catelyn;Robb,Greyjoy,Theon,Black,Knight,Brynden,;0.0;13114;420
The vanguard spread out behind them , a slow-moving forest of lances and banners and spears . " I wonder . Expect nothing of Walder Frey , and you will never be surprised . ";Robb;Catelyn,Greyjoy,Theon,Black,Knight,Brynden,;-0.15;13117;420
" He 's your father 's bannerman . ";Catelyn;Robb,Greyjoy,Theon,Black,Knight,Brynden,;0.0;13118;420
" Some men take their oaths more seriously than others , Robb . And Lord Walder was always friendlier with Casterly Rock than my father would have liked . One of his sons is wed to Tywin Lannister 's sister . That means little of itself , to be sure . Lord Walder has sired a great many children over the years , and they must needs marry someone . Still ... ";Robb;Lord,;0.373214285714;13119;420
" Do you think he means to betray us to the Lannisters , my lady ? ";Theon;Catelyn,Robb,Greyjoy,Black,Knight,Brynden,;0.0;13120;420
Catelyn sighed . " If truth be told , I doubt even Lord Frey knows what Lord Frey intends to do . He has an old man 's caution and a young man 's ambition , and has never lacked for cunning . ";Catelyn;Lord,;0.0666666666667;13122;420
" We must have the Twins , Mother , " Robb said heatedly . " There is no other way across the river . You know that . ";Robb;Twins,;-0.125;13123;420
" Yes . And so does Walder Frey , you can be sure of that . ";Catelyn;Frey,;0.5;13124;420
It was there Theon Greyjoy brought them further word from her uncle . " Ser Brynden says to tell you he 's crossed swords with the Lannisters . There are a dozen scouts who wo n't be reporting back to Lord Tywin anytime soon . Or ever . ";Greyjoy;Brynden,;0.0;13126;420
He grinned . " Ser Addam Marbrand commands their outriders , and he 's pulling back south , burning as he goes . He knows where we are , more or less , but the Blackfish vows he will not know when we split . ";Robb;Black,;0.111111111111;13127;420
" Unless Lord Frey tells him , " Catelyn said sharply . " Theon , when you return to my uncle , tell him he is to place his best bowmen around the Twins , day and night , with orders to bring down any raven they see leaving the battlements . I want no birds bringing word of my son 's movements to Lord Tywin . ";Catelyn;Lord,;0.422222222222;13128;420
" Ser Brynden has seen to it already , my lady , " Theon replied with a cocky smile . " A few more blackbirds , and we should have enough to bake a pie . I 'll save you their feathers for a hat . ";Theon;Brynden,;0.08;13129;420
She ought to have known that Brynden Blackfish would be well ahead of her . " What have the Freys been doing while the Lannisters burn their fields and plunder their holdfasts ? ";Black;Frey,;0.0;13130;420
" There 's been some fighting between Ser Addam 's men and Lord Walder ' s , " Theon answered . " Not a day 's ride from here , we found two Lannister scouts feeding the crows where the Freys had strung them up . Most of Lord Walder 's strength remains massed at the Twins , though . ";Theon;Frey,;0.5;13131;420
" If he 's been fighting the Lannisters , perhaps he does mean to hold to his vows , " Robb said .;Robb;Lannister,;-0.3125;13133;420
Catelyn was less encouraged . " Defending his own lands is one thing , open battle against Lord Tywin quite another . ";Catelyn;Robb,Greyjoy,Theon,Black,Knight,Brynden,;0.144444444444;13134;420
Robb turned back to Theon Greyjoy . " Has the Blackfish found any other way across the Green Fork ? ";Robb;Black,;-0.108333333333;13135;420
Theon shook his head . " The river 's running high and fast . Ser Brynden says it ca n't be forded , not this far north . ";Theon;Brynden,;0.153333333333;13136;420
" I must have that crossing ! ";Catelyn;Robb,Greyjoy,Theon,Black,Knight,Brynden,;0.0;13137;420
Robb declared , fuming . " Oh , our horses might be able to swim the river , I suppose , but not with armored men on their backs . We'd need to build rafts to pole our steel across , helms and mail and lances , and we do n't have the trees for that . Or the time . Lord Tywin is marching north ... ";Robb;Lord,;0.5;13138;420
" Lord Frey would be a fool to try and bar our way , " Theon Greyjoy said with his customary easy confidence . " We have five times his numbers . You can take the Twins if you need to , Robb . ";Greyjoy;Lord,Twins,;0.433333333333;13140;420
" Not easily , " Catelyn warned them , " and not in time . While you were mounting your siege , Tywin Lannister would bring up his host and assault you from the rear . ";Catelyn;Lannister,;0.0;13141;420
For a moment he looked even younger than his fifteen years , despite his mail and sword and the stubble on his cheeks . " What would my lord father do ? ";Robb;Catelyn,Greyjoy,Theon,Black,Knight,Brynden,;0.0;13143;420
" Find a way across , " she told him . " Whatever it took . ";Knight;Catelyn,Robb,Greyjoy,Theon,Black,Brynden,;0.0;13145;420
Her uncle 's face was grave as he swung down off his horse . " There has been a battle under the walls of Riverrun , " he said , his mouth grim . " We had it from a Lannister outrider we took captive . The Kingslayer has destroyed Edmure 's host and sent the lords of the Trident reeling in flight . ";Robb;King,Edmure,;-0.318518518519;13148;420
A cold hand clutched at Catelyn 's heart . " And my brother ? ";Catelyn;Robb,Greyjoy,Theon,Black,Knight,Brynden,;-0.6;13149;420
" Wounded and taken prisoner , " Ser Brynden said . " Lord Blackwood and the other survivors are under siege inside Riverrun , surrounded by Jaime 's host . ";Brynden;Catelyn,Robb,Greyjoy,Theon,Black,Knight,;-0.125;13150;420
Robb looked fretful . " We must get across this accursed river if we 're to have any hope of relieving them in time . ";Robb;Catelyn,Greyjoy,Theon,Black,Knight,Brynden,;0.0;13151;420
" That will not be easily done , " her uncle cautioned . " Lord Frey has pulled his whole strength back inside his castles , and his gates are closed and barred . ";Catelyn;Lord,;0.0333333333333;13152;420
" Damn the man , " Robb swore . " If the old fool does not relent and let me cross , he 'll leave me no choice but to storm his walls . I 'll pull the Twins down around his ears if I have to , we 'll see how well he likes that ! ";Robb;Twins,;-0.0231481481481;13153;420
" You sound like a sulky boy , Robb , " Catelyn said sharply . " A child sees an obstacle , and his first thought is to run around it or knock it down . A lord must learn that sometimes words can accomplish what swords cannot . ";Catelyn;Robb,Greyjoy,Theon,Black,Knight,Brynden,;0.164814814815;13154;420
Robb 's neck reddened at the rebuke . " Tell me what you mean , Mother , " he said meekly .;Robb;Catelyn,Greyjoy,Theon,Black,Knight,Brynden,;-0.3125;13155;420
" The Freys have held the crossing for six hundred years , and for six hundred years they have never failed to exact their toll . ";Catelyn;Frey,;-0.125;13156;420
" What toll ? What does he want ? ";Robb;Catelyn,Greyjoy,Theon,Black,Knight,Brynden,;0.0;13157;420
She smiled . " That is what we must discover . ";Catelyn;Robb,Greyjoy,Theon,Black,Knight,Brynden,;0.6;13158;420
" And what if I do not choose to pay this toll ? ";Robb;Catelyn,Greyjoy,Theon,Black,Knight,Brynden,;0.0;13159;420
" Then you had best retreat back to Moat Cailin , deploy to meet Lord Tywin in battle ... or grow wings . I see no other choices . ";Catelyn;Cailin,;0.291666666667;13160;420
Lord Rickard Karstark glowered in silence . " That cannot be assaulted , my lords , " Roose Bolton announced .;Lord;Tallhart,Frey,Glover,Bolton,Wendel,Wyl,Greatjon,Catelyn,Stevron,Robb,Serrett,;0.0;13177;421
" Nor can we take it by siege , without an army on the far bank to invest the other castle , " Helman Tallhart said gloomily .;Tallhart;Lord,Frey,Glover,Bolton,Wendel,Wyl,Greatjon,Catelyn,Stevron,Robb,Serrett,;-0.0125;13178;421
Across the deep-running green waters , the western twin stood like a reflection of its eastern brother . " Even if we had the time . Which , to be sure , we do not . ";Robb;Lord,Tallhart,Frey,Glover,Bolton,Wendel,Wyl,Greatjon,Catelyn,Stevron,Serrett,;0.1;13179;421
The Freys all looked like weasels ; Ser Stevron , past sixty with grandchildren of his own , looked like an especially old and tired weasel , yet he was polite enough . " My lord father has sent me to greet you , and inquire as to who leads this mighty host . ";Frey;Lord,Tallhart,Glover,Bolton,Wendel,Wyl,Greatjon,Catelyn,Stevron,Robb,Serrett,;0.0916666666667;13183;421
" I do . ";Robb;Lord,Tallhart,Frey,Glover,Bolton,Wendel,Wyl,Greatjon,Catelyn,Stevron,Serrett,;0.0;13184;421
The old knight looked at her son with a faint flicker of amusement in his watery grey eyes , though his gelding whickered uneasily and sidled away from the direwolf . " My lord father would be most honored if you would share meat and mead with him in the castle and explain your purpose here . ";Serrett;Lord,Tallhart,Frey,Glover,Bolton,Wendel,Wyl,Greatjon,Catelyn,Stevron,Robb,;0.0125;13187;421
" You must not do this , my lord , " Galbart Glover pleaded with Robb . " Lord Walder is not to be trusted . ";Glover;Lord,;0.0;13191;421
Roose Bolton nodded . " Go in there alone and you 're his . He can sell you to the Lannisters , throw you in a dungeon , or slit your throat , as he likes . ";Bolton;Lord,Tallhart,Frey,Glover,Wendel,Wyl,Greatjon,Catelyn,Stevron,Robb,Serrett,;0.0;13192;421
" If he wants to talk to us , let him open his gates , and we will all share his meat and mead , " declared Ser Wendel Manderly .;Wendel;Lord,Tallhart,Frey,Glover,Bolton,Wyl,Greatjon,Catelyn,Stevron,Robb,Serrett,;0.1;13193;421
" Or let him come out and treat with Robb here , in plain sight of his men and ours , " suggested his brother , Ser Wylis .;Wyl;Lord,Tallhart,Frey,Glover,Bolton,Wendel,Greatjon,Catelyn,Stevron,Robb,Serrett,;-0.214285714286;13194;421
She had to act , and quickly . " I will go , " she said loudly .;Robb;Lord,Tallhart,Frey,Glover,Bolton,Wendel,Wyl,Greatjon,Catelyn,Stevron,Serrett,;0.0;13197;421
" You , my lady ? ";Greatjon;Lord,Tallhart,Frey,Glover,Bolton,Wendel,Wyl,Catelyn,Stevron,Robb,Serrett,;0.0;13198;421
" Mother , are you certain ? ";Robb;Lord,Tallhart,Frey,Glover,Bolton,Wendel,Wyl,Greatjon,Catelyn,Stevron,Serrett,;0.214285714286;13200;421
" Never more , " Catelyn lied glibly . " Lord Walder is my father 's bannerman . I have known him since I was a girl . He would never offer me any harm . ";Catelyn;Lord,;0.5;13202;421
" I am certain my lord father would be pleased to speak to the Lady Catelyn , " Ser Stevron said . " To vouchsafe for our good intentions , my brother Ser Perwyn will remain here until she is safely returned to you . ";Stevron;Perwyn,;0.454761904762;13204;421
" He shall be our honored guest , " said Robb .;Robb;Lord,Tallhart,Frey,Glover,Bolton,Wendel,Wyl,Greatjon,Catelyn,Stevron,Serrett,;0.0;13205;421
Ser Perwyn , the youngest of the four Freys in the party , dismounted and handed the reins of his horse to a brother . " I require my lady mother 's return by evenfall , Ser Stevron , " Robb went on . " It is not my intent to linger here long . ";Robb;Lord,Tallhart,Frey,Glover,Bolton,Wendel,Wyl,Greatjon,Catelyn,Stevron,Serrett,;-0.05;13206;421
Ser Stevron Frey gave a polite nod . " As you say , my lord . ";Serrett;Lord,Tallhart,Frey,Glover,Bolton,Wendel,Wyl,Greatjon,Catelyn,Stevron,Robb,;0.0;13207;421
" It is a great pleasure to see you again after so many years , my lord , " Catelyn said .;Catelyn;Stevron,Lord,Frey,Robb,;0.65;13215;422
The old man squinted at her suspiciously . " Is it ? I doubt that . Spare me your sweet words , Lady Catelyn , I am too old . Why are you here ? Is your boy too proud to come before me himself ? What am I to do with you ? ";Lord;Catelyn,Stevron,Frey,Robb,;0.3375;13216;422
" Father , " Ser Stevron said reproachfully , " you forget yourself . Lady Stark is here at your invitation . ";Stevron;Stark,;-0.2;13220;422
" Did I ask you ? You are not Lord Frey yet , not until I die . Do I look dead ? I 'll hear no instructions from you . ";Catelyn;Stevron,Lord,Frey,Robb,;-0.2;13221;422
" This is no way to speak in front of our noble guest , Father , " one of his younger sons said .;Robb;Catelyn,Stevron,Lord,Frey,;0.3;13222;422
" Now my bastards presume to teach me courtesy , " Lord Walder complained . " I 'll speak any way I like , damn you . I 've had three kings to guest in my life , and queens as well , do you think I require lessons from the likes of you , Ryger ? Your mother was milking goats the first time I gave her my seed . ";Lord;Catelyn,Stevron,Frey,Robb,;-0.025;13223;422
He dismissed the red-faced youth with a flick of his fingers and gestured to two of his other sons . " Danwell , Whalen , help me to my chair . ";Robb;Catelyn,Stevron,Lord,Frey,;-0.125;13224;422
When he was settled , the old man beckoned Catelyn forward and planted a papery dry kiss on her hand . " There , " he announced . " Now that I have observed the courtesies , my lady , perhaps my sons will do me the honor of shutting their mouths . Why are you here ? ";Catelyn;Stevron,Lord,Frey,Robb,;0.0166666666667;13227;422
" To ask you to open your gates , my lord , " Catelyn replied politely . " My son and his lords bannermen are most anxious to cross the river and be on their way . ";Catelyn;Stevron,Lord,Frey,Robb,;0.0625;13228;422
" To Riverrun ? ";Lord;Catelyn,Stevron,Frey,Robb,;0.0;13229;422
He sniggered . " Oh , no need to tell me , no need . I 'm not blind yet . The old man can still read a map . ";Robb;Catelyn,Stevron,Lord,Frey,;-0.2;13230;422
" To Riverrun , " Catelyn confirmed .;Catelyn;Stevron,Lord,Frey,Robb,;0.4;13231;422
She saw no reason to deny it . " Where I might have expected to find you , my lord . You are still my father 's bannerman , are you not ? ";Robb;Catelyn,Stevron,Lord,Frey,;-0.1;13232;422
" Heh , " said Lord Walder , a noise halfway between a laugh and a grunt . " I called my swords , yes I did , here they are , you saw them on the walls . It was my intent to march as soon as all my strength was assembled . Well , to send my sons . I am well past marching myself , Lady Catelyn . ";Lord;Catelyn,Stevron,Frey,Robb,;0.025;13233;422
He looked around for likely confirmation and pointed to a tall , stooped man of fifty years . " Tell her , Jared . Tell her that was my intent . ";Catelyn;Stevron,Lord,Frey,Robb,;0.0;13234;422
" It was , my lady , " said Ser Jared Frey , one of his sons by his second wife . " On my honor . ";Frey;Catelyn,Stevron,Lord,Robb,;0.0;13235;422
" Is it my fault that your fool brother lost his battle before we could march ? ";Lord;Catelyn,Stevron,Frey,Robb,;0.0;13236;422
He leaned back against his cushions and scowled at her , as if challenging her to dispute his version of events . " I am told the Kingslayer went through him like an axe through ripe cheese . Why should my boys hurry south to die ? All those who did go south are running north again . ";Catelyn;King,;0.25;13237;422
Calmly , she said , " All the more reason that we must reach Riverrun , and soon . Where can we go to talk , my lord ? ";Robb;Riverrun,;0.5;13239;422
" We 're talking now , " Lord Frey complained .;Lord;Catelyn,Stevron,Frey,Robb,;-0.3;13240;422
The spotted pink head snapped around . " What are you all looking at ? ";Catelyn;Stevron,Lord,Frey,Robb,;-0.1;13241;422
he shouted at his kin . " Get out of here . Lady Stark wants to speak to me in private . Might be she has designs on my fidelity , heh . Go , all of you , find something useful to do . Yes , you too , woman . Out , out , out . ";Lord;Stark,;0.075;13242;422
As his sons and grandsons and daughters and bastards and nieces and nephews streamed from the hall , he leaned close to Catelyn and confessed , " They 're all waiting for me to die . Stevron 's been waiting for forty years , but I keep disappointing him . Heh . Why should I die just so he can be a lord ? I ask you . I wo n't do it . ";Catelyn;Stevron,Lord,Frey,Robb,;-0.6;13243;422
" I have every hope that you will live to be a hundred . ";Lord;Catelyn,Stevron,Frey,Robb,;0.136363636364;13244;422
" That would boil them , to be sure . Oh , to be sure . Now , what do you want to say ? ";Robb;Catelyn,Stevron,Lord,Frey,;0.5;13245;422
" We want to cross , " Catelyn told him .;Catelyn;Stevron,Lord,Frey,Robb,;0.0;13246;422
" Oh , do you ? That 's blunt . Why should I let you ? ";Lord;Catelyn,Stevron,Frey,Robb,;0.0;13247;422
For a moment her anger flared . " If you were strong enough to climb your own battlements , Lord Frey , you would see that my son has twenty thousand men outside your walls . ";Catelyn;Stevron,Lord,Frey,Robb,;0.0666666666667;13248;422
" They 'll be twenty thousand fresh corpses when Lord Tywin gets here , " the old man shot back . " Do n't you try and frighten me , my lady . Your husband 's in some traitor 's cell under the Red Keep , your father 's sick , might be dying , and Jaime Lannister 's got your brother in chains . What do you have that I should fear ? That son of yours ? I 'll match you son for son , and I 'll still have eighteen when yours are all dead . ";Lord;Lord,;-0.0857142857143;13249;422
" You swore an oath to my father , " Catelyn reminded him .;Catelyn;Stevron,Lord,Frey,Robb,;0.0;13250;422
He bobbed his head side to side , smiling . " Oh , yes , I said some words , but I swore oaths to the crown too , it seems to me . Joffrey 's the king now , and that makes you and your boy and all those fools out there no better than rebels . If I had the sense the gods gave a fish , I'd help the Lannisters boil you all . ";Lord;Joffrey,I'd,;0.5;13251;422
" Why do n't you ? ";Catelyn;Stevron,Lord,Frey,Robb,;0.0;13252;422
Lord Walder snorted with disdain . " Lord Tywin the proud and splendid , Warden of the West , Hand of the King , oh , what a great man that one is , him and his gold this and gold that and lions here and lions there . I 'll wager you , he eats too many beans , he breaks wind just like me , but you 'll never hear him admit it , oh , no . What 's he got to be so puffed up about anyway ? Only two sons , and one of them 's a twisted little monster . I 'll match him son for son , and I 'll still have nineteen and a half left when all of his are dead ! ";Lord;Catelyn,Stevron,Frey,Robb,;0.17875;13254;422
He cackled . " If Lord Tywin wants my help , he can bloody well ask for it . ";Robb;Lord,;-0.3;13255;422
That was all Catelyn needed to hear . " I am asking for your help , my lord , " she said humbly . " And my father and my brother and my lord husband and my sons are asking with my voice . ";Catelyn;Stevron,Lord,Frey,Robb,;0.0;13256;422
Lord Walder jabbed a bony finger at her face . " Save your sweet words , my lady . Sweet words I get from my wife . Did you see her ? Sixteen she is , a little flower , and her honey 's only for me . I wager she gives me a son by this time next year . Perhaps I 'll make him heir , would n't that boil the rest of them ? ";Lord;Catelyn,Stevron,Frey,Robb,;0.1025;13257;422
" I 'm certain she will give you many sons . ";Catelyn;Stevron,Lord,Frey,Robb,;0.357142857143;13258;422
His head bobbed up and down . " Your lord father did not come to the wedding . An insult , as I see it . Even if he is dying . He never came to my last wedding either . He calls me the Late Lord Frey , you know . Does he think I 'm dead ? I 'm not dead , and I promise you , I 'll outlive him as I outlived his father . Your family has always pissed on me , do n't deny it , do n't lie , you know it 's true . Years ago , I went to your father and suggested a match between his son and my daughter . Why not ? I had a daughter in mind , sweet girl , only a few years older than Edmure , but if your brother did n't warm to her , I had others he might have had , young ones , old ones , virgins , widows , whatever he wanted . No , Lord Hoster would not hear of it . Sweet words he gave me , excuses , but what I wanted was to get rid of a daughter .;Lord;Lord,;0.0686507936508;13259;422
" And your sister , that one , she 's full as bad . It was , oh , a year ago , no more , Jon Arryn was still the King 's Hand , and I went to the city to see my sons ride in the tourney . Stevron and Jared are too old for the lists now , but Danwell and Hosteen rode , Perwyn as well , and a couple of my bastards tried the melee . If I'd known how they'd shame me , I would never have troubled myself to make the journey . Why did I need to ride all that way to see Hosteen knocked off his horse by that Tyrell whelp ? I ask you . The boy 's half his age , Ser Daisy they call him , something like that . And Danwell was unhorsed by a hedge knight ! Some days I wonder if those two are truly mine . My third wife was a Crakehall , all of the Crakehall women are sluts . Well , never mind about that , she died before you were born , what do you care ?;Catelyn;Jon,Stevron,I'd,Hosteen,Danwell,Crakehall,;-0.0678571428571;13260;422
" I was speaking of your sister . I proposed that Lord and Lady Arryn foster two of my grandsons at court , and offered to take their own son to ward here at the Twins . Are my grandsons unworthy to be seen at the king 's court ? They are sweet boys , quiet and mannerly . Walder is Merrett 's son , named after me , and the other one ... heh , I do n't recall ... he might have been another Walder , they 're always naming them Walder so I 'll favor them , but his father ... which one was his father now ? ";Lord;Arryn,Walder,Merrett,;0.265;13261;422
His face wrinkled up . " Well , whoever he was , Lord Arryn would n't have him , or the other one , and I blame your lady sister for that . She frosted up as if I'd suggested selling her boy to a mummer 's show or making a eunuch out of him , and when Lord Arryn said the child was going to Dragonstone to foster with Stannis Baratheon , she stormed off without a word of regrets and all the Hand could give me was apologies . What good are apologies ? I ask you . ";Robb;Lord,I'd,;0.2625;13262;422
Catelyn frowned , disquieted . " I had understood that Lysa 's boy was to be fostered with Lord Tywin at Casterly Rock . ";Catelyn;Stevron,Lord,Frey,Robb,;0.0;13263;422
" No , it was Lord Stannis , " Walder Frey said irritably . " Do you think I ca n't tell Lord Stannis from Lord Tywin ? They 're both bungholes who think they 're too noble to shit , but never mind about that , I know the difference . Or do you think I 'm so old I ca n't remember ? I 'm ninety and I remember very well . I remember what to do with a woman too . That wife of mine will give me a son before this time next year , I 'll wager . Or a daughter , that ca n't be helped . Boy or girl , it will be red , wrinkled , and squalling , and like as not she 'll want to name it Walder or Walda . ";Frey;Lord,Walder,;0.116666666667;13264;422
Catelyn was not concerned with what Lady Frey might choose to name her child . " Jon Arryn was going to foster his son with Lord Stannis , you are quite certain of that ? ";Catelyn;Jon,;0.214285714286;13265;422
" Yes , yes , yes , " the old man said . " Only he died , so what does it matter ? You say you want to cross the river ? ";Lord;Catelyn,Stevron,Frey,Robb,;0.0333333333333;13266;422

Lord Walder announced crisply . " Not unless I allow it , and why should I ? The Tullys and the Starks have never been friends of mine . ";Lord;Stark,;0.0;13269;422
Robb galloped out to meet her , with Grey Wind racing beside his stallion . " It 's done , " she told him . " Lord Walder will grant you your crossing . His swords are yours as well , less four hundred he means to keep back to hold the Twins . I suggest that you leave four hundred of your own , a mixed force of archers and swordsmen . He can scarcely object to an offer to augment his garrison ... but make certain you give the command to a man you can trust . Lord Walder may need help keeping faith .

" As you say , Mother , " Robb answered , gazing at the ranks of pikemen . " Perhaps ... Ser Helman Tallhart , do you think ? ";Robb;Catelyn,Stevron,Lord,Frey,;0.0;13276;422
" A fine choice . ";Catelyn;Stevron,Lord,Frey,Robb,;0.416666666667;13277;422
" What ... what did he want of us ? ";Lord;Catelyn,Stevron,Frey,Robb,;0.0;13278;422
" If you can spare a few of your swords , I need some men to escort two of Lord Frey 's grandsons north to Winterfell , " she told him . " I have agreed to take them as wards .

" Also , if your sister Arya is returned to us safely , it is agreed that she will marry Lord Walder 's youngest son , Elmar , when the two of them come of age . ";Lord;sister,Lord,;0.0;13284;422
Robb looked nonplussed . " Arya wo n't like that one bit . ";Robb;Arya,;0.0;13285;422
" And you are to wed one of his daughters , once the fighting is done , " she finished . " His lordship has graciously consented to allow you to choose whichever girl you prefer . He has a number he thinks might be suitable . ";Catelyn;Stevron,Lord,Frey,Robb,;0.55;13286;422
To his credit , Robb did not flinch . " I see . ";Robb;Catelyn,Stevron,Lord,Frey,;0.0;13287;422

loudly , as if that could make it true . " And you ? ";Lord;Jon,Mormont,troubled,;0.35;13310;423
Mormont frowned . " A dead man tried to kill me . How well could I be ? ";Mormont;Lord,Jon,troubled,;-0.2;13311;423
The pale stubble of his new whiskers made him look old , disreputable , and grumpy . " You do not look well . How is your hand ? ";Lord;Jon,Mormont,troubled,;0.118181818182;13314;423
" Healing . ";Jon;Lord,Mormont,troubled,;0.0;13315;423
His cracked red skin oozed fluid , and fearsome blood blisters rose between his fingers , big as roaches . " The maester says I 'll have scars , but otherwise the hand should be as good as it was before . ";Lord;Jon,Mormont,troubled,;0.25;13319;423

" You know , " Mormont grumbled . " How is it that everyone knows everything around here ? ";Mormont;Old,Jon,;0.0;13332;424
He did not seem to expect an answer . " It would seem there were only the two of ... of those creatures , whatever they were , I will not call them men . And thank the gods for that . Any more and ... well , that does n't bear thinking of . There will be more , though . I can feel it in these old bones of mine , and Maester Aemon agrees . The cold winds are rising . Summer is at an end , and a winter is coming such as this world has never seen . ";Old;Maester,Summer,;0.0833333333333;13333;424
The Stark words had never sounded so grim or ominous to Jon as they did now . " My lord , " he asked hesitantly , " it 's said there was a bird last night ... ";Jon;Old,Mormont,;-0.4;13335;424
" There was . What of it ? ";Mormont;Old,Jon,;0.0;13336;424
" I had hoped for some word of my father . ";Jon;Old,Mormont,;0.0;13337;424
" Father , " taunted the old raven , bobbing its head as it walked across Mormont 's shoulders . " Father . ";Mormont;Old,Jon,;0.1;13338;424
The Lord Commander reached up to pinch its beak shut , but the raven hopped up on his head , fluttered its wings , and flew across the chamber to light above a window . " Grief and noise , " Mormont grumbled . " That 's all they 're good for , ravens . Why I put up with that pestilential bird ... if there was news of Lord Eddard , do n't you think I would have sent for you ? Bastard or no , you 're still his blood . The message concerned Ser Barristan Selmy . It seems he 's been removed from the Kingsguard . They gave his place to that black dog Clegane , and now Selmy 's wanted for treason . The fools sent some watchmen to seize him , but he slew two of them and escaped . ";Mormont;Serrett,;0.0166666666667;13339;424
Mormont snorted , leaving no doubt of his view of men who'd send gold cloaks against a knight as renowed as Barristan the Bold . " We have white shadows in the woods and unquiet dead stalking our halls , and a boy sits the Iron Throne , " he said in disgust .;Mormont;Old,Jon,;0.0444444444444;13340;424

He gave an irritated shrug . " Perhaps they never got my letter . Aemon sent two copies , with his best birds , but who can say ? More like , Pycelle did not deign to reply . It would not be the first time , nor the last . I fear we count for less than nothing in King 's Landing . They tell us what they want us to know , and that 's little enough .

" Corn , " the raven was crying . " Corn , corn . ";Lord;Old,Jon,Mormont,;-0.2;13354;425
" Oh , be quiet , " the Old Bear told it . " Snow , how soon does Maester Aemon say you 'll have use of that hand back ? ";Old;Maester,;0.0333333333333;13355;425
" Soon , " Jon replied .;Jon;Old,Lord,Mormont,;0.0;13356;425
" Good . ";Old;Jon,Lord,Mormont,;0.65;13357;425
On the table between them , Lord Mormont laid a large sword in a black metal scabbard banded with silver . " Here . You 'll be ready for this , then . ";Lord;Old,Jon,Mormont,;0.0619047619048;13358;425
He had no inkling what this meant . " My lord ? ";Old;Jon,Lord,Mormont,;0.0;13361;425
" The fire melted the silver off the pommel and burnt the crossguard and grip . Well , dry leather and old wood , what could you expect ? The blade , now ... you'd need a fire a hundred times as hot to harm the blade . ";Lord;Old,Jon,Mormont,;0.0944444444444;13362;425
Mormont shoved the scabbard across the rough oak planks . " I had the rest made anew . Take it . ";Mormont;Old,Jon,Lord,;-0.1;13363;425
" Take it , " echoed his raven , preening . " Take it , take it . ";Lord;Old,Jon,Mormont,;0.0;13364;425
Where Ice was a true two-handed greatsword , this was a hand-and-a-halfer , sometimes named a " bastard sword . ";Ice;Jon,Old,;0.35;13372;426
When Jon turned it sideways , he could see the ripples in the dark steel where the metal had been folded back on itself again and again . " This is Valyrian steel , my lord , " he said wonderingly .;Jon;Ice,Old,;-0.075;13374;426
" It is , " the Old Bear told him . " It was my father 's sword , and his father 's before him . The Mormonts have carried it for five centuries . I wielded it in my day and passed it on to my son when I took the black . ";Old;Mormont,;-0.0333333333333;13376;426
The edges glimmered faintly as they kissed the light . " Your son - ";Ice;Jon,Old,;0.4;13380;426
" My son brought dishonor to House Mormont , but at least he had the grace to leave the sword behind when he fled . My sister returned it to my keeping , but the very sight of it reminded me of Jorah 's shame , so I put it aside and thought no more of it until we found it in the ashes of my bedchamber . The original pommel was a bear 's head , silver , yet so worn its features were all but indistinguishable . For you , I thought a white wolf more apt . One of our builders is a fair stonecarver .

He twitched his burned fingers , feeling a throb of pain deep under the skin . " My lord , you honor me , but - ";Lord;;0.0;13389;427
" Spare me your but ' s , boy , " Lord Mormont interrupted . " I would not be sitting here were it not for you and that beast of yours . You fought bravely ... and more to the point , you thought quickly . Fire ! Yes , damn it . We ought to have known . We ought to have remembered . The Long Night has come before . Oh , eight thousand years is a good while , to be sure ... yet if the Night 's Watch does not remember , who will ? ";Lord;Night,;0.43125;13390;427
" Who will , " chimed the talkative raven . " Who will . ";Lord;;0.0;13391;427
" A sword 's small payment for a life , " Mormont concluded . " Take it , I 'll hear no more of it , is that understood ? ";Mormont;;0.125;13400;428
" Yes , my lord . ";Mormont;;0.0;13401;428
" I want no courtesies either , " Mormont said , " so thank me no thanks . Honor the steel with deeds , not words . ";Mormont;Jon,Old,Lord,Pyp,Grenn,Halder,;0.2;13409;429
Jon nodded . " Does it have a name , my lord ? ";Jon;Mormont,Old,Lord,Pyp,Grenn,Halder,;0.0;13410;429
" It did , once . Longclaw , it was called . ";Pyp;Mormont,Jon,Old,Lord,Grenn,Halder,;0.0;13411;429

" Longclaw is an apt name . ";Jon;Long,;0.6;13413;429
He was clumsy and uncomfortable with his left hand , yet even so the steel seemed to flow through the air , as if it had a will of its own . " Wolves have claws , as much as bears . ";Pyp;Mormont,Jon,Old,Lord,Grenn,Halder,;0.05;13415;429
The Old Bear seemed pleased by that . " I suppose they do . You 'll want to wear that over the shoulder , I imagine . It 's too long for the hip , at least until you 've put on a few inches . And you 'll need to work at your two-handed strikes as well . Ser Endrew can show you some moves , when your burns have healed . ";Old;Endrew,;0.01;13416;429
" Ser Endrew ? ";Jon;Mormont,Old,Lord,Pyp,Grenn,Halder,;0.0;13417;429

Jon lowered the sword . " Why ? ";Jon;Mormont,Old,Lord,Pyp,Grenn,Halder,;0.0;13420;429
Mormont snorted . " Because I sent him , why do you think ? He 's bringing the hand your Ghost tore off the end of Jafer Flowers 's wrist . I have commanded him to take ship to King 's Landing and lay it before this boy king . That should get young Joffrey 's attention , I'd think ... and Ser Alliser 's a knight , highborn , anointed , with old friends at court , altogether harder to ignore than a glorified crow .

He jabbed a finger up at Jon 's face . " And do n't think this means I approve of that nonsense in the common hall . Valor makes up for a fair amount of folly , but you 're not a boy anymore , however many years you 've seen . That 's a man 's sword you have there , and it will take a man to wield her .

The hunched , pink-eyed brother handed Jon the bucket and scurried down the ladder . " Toss the meat into the cages , " Aemon instructed him . " The birds will do the rest . ";Aemon;Jon,Clydas,;-0.155555555556;13502;431
Quickly Jon grabbed a second handful and threw it in after the first . " Lord Mormont 's raven likes fruit and corn . ";Jon;Clydas,Aemon,;0.125;13508;431
" He is a rare bird , " the maester said . " Most ravens will eat grain , but they prefer flesh . It makes them strong , and I fear they relish the taste of blood . In that they are like men ... and like men , not all ravens are alike . ";Clydas;Jon,Aemon,;0.411111111111;13509;431
" Doves and pigeons can also be trained to carry messages , " the maester went on , " though the raven is a stronger flyer , larger , bolder , far more clever , better able to defend itself against hawks ... yet ravens are black , and they eat the dead , so some godly men abhor them . Baelor the Blessed tried to replace all the ravens with doves , did you know ? ";Aemon;Baelor,;0.175;13514;431
The maester turned his white eyes on Jon , smiling . " The Night 's Watch prefers ravens . ";Jon;Clydas,Aemon,;0.0;13515;431
Jon 's fingers were in the bucket , blood up to the wrist . " Dywen says the wildlings call us crows , " he said uncertainly .;Jon;Dywen,;0.0;13516;431
" The crow is the raven 's poor cousin . They are both beggars in black , hated and misunderstood . ";Clydas;Jon,Aemon,;-0.488888888889;13517;431
" Jon , did you ever wonder why the men of the Night 's Watch take no wives and father no children ? ";Aemon;Jon,Clydas,;0.0;13521;431
Jon shrugged . " No . ";Jon;Clydas,Aemon,;0.0;13523;431
" So they will not love , " the old man answered , " for love is the bane of honor , the death of duty . ";Clydas;Jon,Aemon,;0.366666666667;13526;431
The old man seemed to sense his doubts . " Tell me , Jon , if the day should ever come when your lord father must needs choose between honor on the one hand and those he loves on the other , what would he do ? ";Jon;Clydas,Aemon,;-0.0125;13529;431
And your mother , what of his duty to her , he will not even say her name . " He would do whatever was right , " he said ...;Clydas;Jon,Aemon,;0.285714285714;13532;431
ringingly , to make up for his hesitation . " No matter what . ";Jon;Clydas,Aemon,;0.0;13533;431
" Then Lord Eddard is a man in ten thousand . Most of us are not so strong . What is honor compared to a woman 's love ? What is duty against the feel of a newborn son in your arms ... or the memory of a brother 's smile ? Wind and words . Wind and words . We are only human , and the gods have fashioned us for love . That is our great glory , and our great tragedy .;Clydas;Lord,;0.383333333333;13534;431
" The men who formed the Night 's Watch knew that only their courage shielded the realm from the darkness to the north . They knew they must have no divided loyalties to weaken their resolve . So they vowed they would have no wives nor children .;Jon;Night,;0.0;13535;431
" Yet brothers they had , and sisters . Mothers who gave them birth , fathers who gave them names . They came from a hundred quarrelsome kingdoms , and they knew times may change , but men do not . So they pledged as well that the Night 's Watch would take no part in the battles of the realms it guarded .;Clydas;Jon,Aemon,;0.4;13536;431
" They kept their pledge . When Aegon slew Black Harren and claimed his kingdom , Harren 's brother was Lord Commander on the Wall , with ten thousand swords to hand . He did not march . In the days when the Seven Kingdoms were seven kingdoms , not a generation passed that three or four of them were not at war . The Watch took no part . When the Andals crossed the narrow sea and swept away the kingdoms of the First Men , the sons of the fallen kings held true to their vows and remained at their posts . So it has always been , for years beyond counting . Such is the price of honor .;Jon;Andals,Lord,;0.0388888888889;13537;431
" A craven can be as brave as any man , when there is nothing to fear . And we all do our duty , when there is no cost to it . How easy it seems then , to walk the path of honor . Yet soon or late in every man 's life comes a day when it is not easy , a day when he must choose . ";Clydas;Jon,Aemon,;0.341666666667;13538;431
Jon could feel the weight of all those tiny black eyes . " And this is my day ... is that what you 're saying ? ";Jon;Clydas,Aemon,;-0.0833333333333;13541;431
The old man laid a withered , spotted hand on his shoulder . " It hurts , boy , " he said softly . " Oh , yes . Choosing ... it has always hurt . And always will . I know . ";Jon;Maester,;0.1;13550;432
" You do n't know , " Jon said bitterly . " No one knows . Even if I am his bastard , he 's still my father ... ";Jon;Maester,;0.0;13551;432
Maester Aemon sighed . " Have you heard nothing I 've told you , Jon ? Do you think you are the first ? ";Maester;Jon,;0.25;13552;432
He shook his ancient head , a gesture weary beyond words . " Three times the gods saw fit to test my vows . Once when I was a boy , once in the fullness of my manhood , and once when I had grown old . By then my strength was fled , my eyes grown dim , yet that last choice was as cruel as the first . My ravens would bring the news from the south , words darker than their wings , the ruin of my House , the death of my kin , disgrace and desolation . What could I have done , old , blind , frail ? I was helpless as a suckling babe , yet still it grieved me to sit forgotten as they cut down my brother 's poor grandson , and his son , and even the little children ... ";Jon;Maester,;-0.117550505051;13553;432
Jon was shocked to see the shine of tears in the old man 's eyes . " Who are you ? ";Jon;Maester,;-0.3;13554;432
A toothless smile quivered on the ancient lips . " Only a maester of the Citadel , bound in service to Castle Black and the Night 's Watch . In my order , we put aside our house names when we take our vows and don the collar . ";Jon;Maester,;0.0444444444444;13556;432
The old man touched the maester 's chain that hung loosely around his thin , fleshless neck . " My father was Maekar , the First of his Name , and my brother Aegon reigned after him in my stead . My grandfather named me for Prince Aemon the Dragonknight , who was his uncle , or his father , depending on which tale you believe . Aemon , he called me ... ";Jon;Aegon,Maekar,Prince,;-0.0166666666667;13557;432
" Aemon ... Targaryen ? ";Jon;Maester,;0.0;13558;432
" Once , " the old man said . " Once . So you see , Jon , I do know ... and knowing , I will not tell you stay or go . You must make that choice yourself , and live with it all the rest of your days . As I have . ";Jon;Maester,;0.118181818182;13560;432
His voice fell to a whisper . " As I have ... ";Jon;Maester,;0.0;13561;432
Ser Jorah lifted the visor of his flat-topped greathelm as he rode up . " Your lord husband awaits you within the town . ";Jorah;;0.0;13597;433
" Drogo took no harm ? ";Jorah;Drogo,;0.0;13598;433
" A few cuts , " Ser Jorah answered , " nothing of consequence . He slew two khals this day . Khal Ogo first , and then the son , Fogo , who became khal when Ogo fell . His bloodriders cut the bells from their hair , and now Khal Drogo 's every step rings louder than before . ";Jorah;Ogo,;0.025;13599;433
" Most of Ogo 's riders fled , " Ser Jorah was saying . " Still , there may be as many as ten thousand captives . ";Jorah;Dany,Dothraki,Quaro,Irri,Drogo,Jhogo,;0.333333333333;13610;434
" I 've told the khal he ought to make for Meereen , " Ser Jorah said . " They 'll pay a better price than he'd get from a slaving caravan . Illyrio writes that they had a plague last year , so the brothels are paying double for healthy young girls , and triple for boys under ten . If enough children survive the journey , the gold will buy us all the ships we need , and hire men to sail them . ";Jorah;Illyrio,;0.157142857143;13615;434
Dany 's hand clenched hard around the reins , and she turned the silver 's head . " Make them stop , " she commanded Ser Jorah .;Dany;Jorah,Dothraki,Quaro,Irri,Drogo,Jhogo,;-0.291666666667;13617;434
" Khaleesi ? ";Jorah;Dany,Dothraki,Quaro,Irri,Drogo,Jhogo,;0.0;13618;434
" You heard my words , " she said . " Stop them . ";Dany;Jorah,Dothraki,Quaro,Irri,Drogo,Jhogo,;0.0;13620;434
She spoke to her khas in the harsh accents of Dothraki . " Jhogo , Quaro , you will aid Ser Jorah . I want no rape . ";Dothraki;Jorah,;-0.2;13621;434
Jorah Mormont spurred his horse closer . " Princess , " he said , " you have a gentle heart , but you do not understand . This is how it has always been . Those men have shed blood for the khal . Now they claim their reward . ";Jorah;Dany,Dothraki,Quaro,Irri,Drogo,Jhogo,;0.2;13623;434
" She is a lamb girl , " Quaro said in Dothraki . " She is nothing , Khaleesi . The riders do her honor . The Lamb Men lay with sheep , it is known . ";Quaro;Jorah,Dany,Dothraki,Irri,Drogo,Jhogo,;0.0;13626;434

" I will not have her harmed , " Dany said . " I claim her . Do as I command you , or Khal Drogo will know the reason why . ";Dany;Drogo,;0.0;13630;434
" Ai , Khaleesi , " Jhogo replied , kicking his horse .;Jhogo;Jorah,Dany,Dothraki,Quaro,Irri,Drogo,;0.0;13631;434
" Go with them , " she commanded Ser Jorah .;Jorah;Dany,Dothraki,Quaro,Irri,Drogo,Jhogo,;0.0;13633;434

" Viserys ? ";Drogo;Jorah,Dany,Dothraki,Quaro,Irri,Jhogo,;0.0;13636;434
" No , " he answered . " Rhaegar . ";Dany;Jorah,Dothraki,Quaro,Irri,Drogo,Jhogo,;0.0;13638;434
He led her across the road to Dany . " What do you want done with her ? ";Dany;;0.0;13653;435
Her hair was matted with blood . " Doreah , see to her hurts . You do not have a rider 's look , perhaps she will not fear you . The rest , with me . ";Dany;;0.0;13655;435
" You cannot claim them all , child , " Ser Jorah said , the fourth time they stopped , while the warriors of her khas herded her new slaves behind her .;Jorah;Dany,;-0.0878787878788;13664;436
" I am khaleesi , heir to the Seven Kingdoms , the blood of the dragon , " Dany reminded him . " It is not for you to tell me what I cannot do . ";Dany;Jorah,;0.0;13665;436
She knelt before the khal . " My sun-and-stars is wounded . ";Dany;Drogo,Jorah,Cohollo,Qotho,Dothraki,Haggo,Mirri,;0.0;13672;437
" Is scratch , moon of life , from arakh of one bloodrider to Khal Ogo , " Khal Drogo said in the Common Tongue . " I kill him for it , and Ogo too . ";Drogo;Dany,Jorah,Cohollo,Qotho,Dothraki,Haggo,Mirri,;-0.3;13674;437

The huge bloodrider gave her a heavy look before he turned to his khal . " This one is Mago , who rides in the khas of Ko Jhaqo . He says the khaleesi has taken his spoils , a daughter of the lambs who was his to mount . ";Mirri;Mago,;0.1;13679;437
Khal Drogo 's face was still and hard , but his black eyes were curious as they went to Dany . " Tell me the truth of this , moon of my life , " he commanded in Dothraki .;Drogo;Dany,Jorah,Cohollo,Qotho,Dothraki,Haggo,Mirri,;-0.186111111111;13680;437

" It pleases me to hold them safe , " Dany said , wondering if she had dared too much . " If your warriors would mount these women , let them take them gently and keep them for wives . Give them places in the khalasar and let them bear you sons . ";Dany;Drogo,Jorah,Cohollo,Qotho,Dothraki,Haggo,Mirri,;0.3;13683;437
It was he who laughed . " Does the horse breed with the sheep ? ";Drogo;Dany,Jorah,Cohollo,Qotho,Dothraki,Haggo,Mirri,;0.7;13685;437
Dany turned on him angrily . " The dragon feeds on horse and sheep alike . ";Dany;Drogo,Jorah,Cohollo,Qotho,Dothraki,Haggo,Mirri,;0.0;13687;437
Khal Drogo smiled . " See how fierce she grows ! ";Drogo;Dany,Jorah,Cohollo,Qotho,Dothraki,Haggo,Mirri,;0.75;13688;437
he said . " It is my son inside her , the stallion who mounts the world , filling her with his fire .

The wounds were worse than Ser Jorah had led her to believe . " Where are the healers ? ";Jorah;Drogo,Dany,Cohollo,Qotho,Dothraki,Haggo,Mirri,;-0.4;13692;437
The herbwomen dealt in potions and spells , the eunuchs in knife , needle , and fire . " Why do they not attend the khal ? ";Drogo;khal,;0.0;13695;437
" The khal sent the hairless men away , Khaleesi , " old Cohollo assured her .;Cohollo;khal,;0.1;13696;437
" Many riders are hurt , " Khal Drogo said stubbornly . " Let them be healed first . This arrow is no more than the bite of a fly , this little cut only a new scar to boast of to my son . ";Drogo;Dany,Jorah,Cohollo,Qotho,Dothraki,Haggo,Mirri,;0.285551948052;13698;437

" My mother was godswife before me , and taught me all the songs and spells most pleasing to the Great Shepherd , and how to make the sacred smokes and ointments from leaf and root and berry . When I was younger and more fair , I went in caravan to Asshai by the Shadow , to learn from their mages . Ships from many lands come to Asshai , so I lingered long to study the healing ways of distant peoples . A moonsinger of the Jogos Nhai gifted me with her birthing songs , a woman of your own riding people taught me the magics of grass and corn and horse , and a maester from the Sunset Lands opened a body for me and showed me all the secrets that hide beneath the skin .

" Oh , surely you can save me a peasant or two , Father , " Tyrion replied . " Not too many , I would n't want to be greedy . ";Tyrion;Lord,Kevan,;0.5;13791;440
" Ser Addam 's outriders say the Stark host has moved south from the Twins , " his father reported as his trencher was filled with slices of pork . " Lord Frey 's levies have joined them . They are likely no more than a day 's march north of us . ";Lord;Tyrion,Kevan,;0.175;13795;440
" Please , Father , " Tyrion said . " I 'm about to eat . ";Tyrion;Lord,Kevan,;0.0;13796;440
" Does the thought of facing the Stark boy unman you , Tyrion ? Your brother Jaime would be eager to come to grips with him . ";Lord;Jaime,;-0.2;13797;440
" I'd sooner come to grips with that pig . Robb Stark is not half so tender , and he never smelled as good . ";Tyrion;I'd,;0.0944444444444;13798;440
Lord Lefford , the sour bird who had charge of their stores and supplies , leaned forward . " I hope your savages do not share your reluctance , else we 've wasted our good steel on them . ";Lord;Tyrion,Kevan,;0.225;13799;440
" My savages will put your steel to excellent use , my lord , " Tyrion replied .;Tyrion;Lord,Kevan,;1.0;13800;440
Lord Lefford frowned . " I saw that great hairy one today , the one who insisted that he must have two battle-axes , the heavy black steel ones with twin crescent blades . ";Lord;Tyrion,Kevan,;0.144444444444;13802;440
" Shagga likes to kill with either hand , " Tyrion said as a trencher of steaming pork was laid in front of him .;Tyrion;Shagga,;0.0;13803;440
" He still had that wood-axe of his strapped to his back . ";Lord;Tyrion,Kevan,;0.0;13804;440
" Shagga is of the opinion that three axes are even better than two . ";Tyrion;Lord,Kevan,;0.5;13805;440
Ser Kevan leaned forward . " We had a thought to put you and your wildlings in the vanguard when we come to battle . ";Kevan;Lord,Tyrion,;0.0;13807;440
Ser Kevan seldom " had a thought " that Lord Tywin had not had first .;Lord;Tyrion,Kevan,;0.25;13808;440
Now he lowered it . " The vanguard ? ";Tyrion;Lord,Kevan,;0.0;13810;440
" They seem ferocious enough , " Ser Kevan said .;Kevan;Lord,Tyrion,;0.0;13814;440
" Ferocious ? ";Lord;Tyrion,Kevan,;0.0;13815;440
His father watched , judging him , weighing every word . " Let me tell you how ferocious they are . Last night , a Moon Brother stabbed a Stone Crow over a sausage . So today as we made camp three Stone Crows seized the man and opened his throat for him . Perhaps they were hoping to get the sausage back , I could n't say . Bronn managed to keep Shagga from chopping off the dead man 's cock , which was fortunate , but even so Ulf is demanding blood money , which Conn and Shagga refuse to pay . ";Tyrion;Brothers,Stone,Bronn,Shagga,Crows,;0.05;13817;440
" When soldiers lack discipline , the fault lies with their lord commander , " his father said .;Lord;Tyrion,Kevan,;0.0;13818;440
He bought loyalty with gold , and compelled obedience with his name . " A bigger man would be able to put the fear in them , is that what you 're saying , my lord ? ";Tyrion;Lord,Kevan,;0.25;13821;440
Lord Tywin Lannister turned to his brother . " If my son 's men will not obey his commands , perhaps the vanguard is not the place for him . No doubt he would be more comfortable in the rear , guarding our baggage train . ";Lord;Tyrion,Kevan,;0.45;13822;440
" Do me no kindnesses , Father , " he said angrily . " If you have no other command to offer me , I 'll lead your van . ";Tyrion;van,;-0.125;13823;440
Lord Tywin studied his dwarf son . " I said nothing about command . You will serve under Ser Gregor . ";Lord;Tyrion,Kevan,;0.0;13824;440
Tyrion took one bite of pork , chewed a moment , and spit it out angrily . " I find I am not hungry after all , " he said , climbing awkwardly off the bench . " Pray excuse me , my lords . ";Tyrion;Lord,Kevan,;0.0;13825;440
Conn son of Coratt waved a tankard of ale . " Tyrion Half man ! Come , sit by our fire , share meat with the Stone Crows . We have an ox . ";Coratt;Stone,;-0.208333333333;13845;441
" I can see that , Conn son of Coratt . ";Coratt;Stone,;0.0;13846;441
Blood and grease dripped down into the flames as two Stone Crows turned the meat . " I thank you . Send for me when the ox is cooked . ";Stone;Coratt,;-0.155555555556;13849;441
Tyrion studied her face for a moment , before he spied fishbones in the ashes . " What did you eat ? ";Tyrion;;0.0;13858;442
" Trout , m'lord , " said his groom . " Bronn caught them . ";Tyrion;Bronn,;0.0;13859;442
Tyrion had made him stick it out once , just to be certain . " Definitely a tongue , " he had said . " Someday you must learn to use it . ";Tyrion;Bronn,Shae,;0.107142857143;13867;443
Tyrion turned his attention back to the girl . " Is this her ? ";Tyrion;Bronn,Shae,;0.0;13869;443
She rose gracefully and looked down at him from the lofty height of five feet or more . " It is , m'lord , and she can speak for herself , if it please you . ";Bronn;Tyrion,Shae,;0.314814814815;13871;443
He cocked his head to one side . " I am Tyrion , of House Lannister . Men call me the Imp. ";Tyrion;Tyrion,;0.0;13872;443
" My mother named me Shae . Men call me ... often . ";Shae;Shae,;0.0;13873;443
Bronn laughed , and Tyrion had to smile . " Into the tent , Shae , if you would be so kind . ";Bronn;Tyrion,Shae,;0.533333333333;13874;443
At the end of the day 's march , Tyrion had sent Bronn back to find him a likely whore . " I would prefer one who is reasonably young , with as pretty a face as you can find , " he had said . " If she has washed sometime this year , I shall be glad . If she has n't , wash her . Be certain that you tell her who I am , and warn her of what I am . ";Tyrion;Bronn,Shae,;0.177380952381;13879;443
He liked that . " Shall I take my gown off , m'lord ? ";Bronn;Tyrion,Shae,;0.6;13885;443
" In good time . Are you a maiden , Shae ? ";Tyrion;Bronn,Shae,;0.65;13887;443
" If it please you , m'lord , " she said demurely .;Bronn;Tyrion,Shae,;0.0;13888;443
" What would please me would be the truth of you , girl . ";Tyrion;Bronn,Shae,;0.0;13889;443
" Aye , but that will cost you double . ";Bronn;Tyrion,Shae,;0.0;13890;443
Tyrion decided they would get along splendidly . " I am a Lannister . Gold I have in plenty , and you 'll find me generous ... but I 'll want more from you than what you 've got between your legs , though I 'll want that too . You 'll share my tent , pour my wine , laugh at my jests , rub the ache from my legs after each day 's ride ... and whether I keep you a day or a year , for so long as we are together you will take no other men into your bed . ";Tyrion;Lannister,;0.15625;13891;443
" Fair enough . ";Bronn;Tyrion,Shae,;0.35;13892;443
There was nothing underneath but Shae . " If he do n't put down that candle , m'lord will burn his fingers . ";Shae;Tyrion,Bronn,;-0.155555555556;13894;443
" What 's that , m'lord ? ";Shae;Bronn,Tyrion,;0.0;13909;444
" Nothing , " he told her . " A song I learned as a boy , that 's all . Go to sleep , sweetling . ";Tyrion;Shae,Bronn,;0.0;13911;444
He was honing the edge of his sword , wide awake ; the sellsword did not seem to sleep like other men . " Where did you find her ? ";Bronn;Shae,Tyrion,;-0.1125;13915;444
" I took her from a knight . The man was loath to give her up , but your name changed his thinking somewhat ... that , and my dirk at his throat . ";Shae;Bronn,Tyrion,;0.0;13917;444
" Splendid , " Tyrion said dryly , shaking off the last drops . " I seem to recall saying find me a whore , not make me an enemy . ";Tyrion;Shae,Bronn,;0.416666666667;13918;444
" The pretty ones were all claimed , " Bronn said . " I 'll be pleased to take her back if you'd prefer a toothless drab . ";Bronn;Shae,Tyrion,;0.25;13919;444
Tyrion limped closer to where he sat . " My lord father would call that insolence , and send you to the mines for impertinence . ";Tyrion;Shae,Bronn,;0.0;13920;444
" Good for me you 're not your father , " Bronn replied . " I saw one with boils all over her nose . Would you like her ? ";Bronn;Shae,Tyrion,;0.65;13921;444
" What , and break your heart ? ";Tyrion;Shae,Bronn,;0.0;13922;444
Tyrion shot back . " I shall keep Shae . Did you perchance note the name of this knight you took her from ? I'd rather not have him beside me in the battle . ";Shae;I'd,Shae,;0.0;13923;444
Bronn rose , cat-quick and cat-graceful , turning his sword in his hand . " You 'll have me beside you in the battle , dwarf . ";Bronn;Shae,Tyrion,;0.6;13924;444
The night air was warm on his bare skin . " See that I survive this battle , and you can name your reward . ";Tyrion;Shae,Bronn,;0.325;13926;444
Bronn tossed the longsword from his right hand to his left , and tried a cut . " Who'd want to kill the likes of you ? ";Bronn;Shae,Tyrion,;0.142857142857;13927;444
" My lord father , for one . He 's put me in the van . ";Tyrion;van,;0.0;13928;444
" I'd do the same . A small man with a big shield . You 'll give the archers fits . ";Bronn;I'd,;-0.0833333333333;13929;444
" I find you oddly cheering , " Tyrion said . " I must be mad . ";Tyrion;Shae,Bronn,;-0.625;13930;444
Bronn sheathed his sword . " Beyond a doubt . ";Bronn;Shae,Tyrion,;0.0;13931;444
When Tyrion returned to his tent , Shae rolled onto her elbow and murmured sleepily , " I woke and m'lord was gone . ";Tyrion;Shae,Bronn,;0.0;13932;444
" M'lord is back now . ";Bronn;Lords,;0.0;13933;444
Her hand went between his stunted legs , and found him hard . " Yes he is , " she whispered , stroking him .;Tyrion;Shae,Bronn,;-0.291666666667;13935;444
He asked her about the man Bronn had taken her from , and she named the minor retainer of an insignificant lordling . " You need not fear his like , m'lord , " the girl said , her fingers busy at his cock . " He is a small man . ";Bronn;Shae,Tyrion,;-0.0666666666667;13936;444
" And what am I , pray ? ";Shae;Bronn,Tyrion,;0.0;13937;444
Tyrion asked her . " A giant ? ";Tyrion;Shae,Bronn,;0.0;13938;444
" Oh , yes , " she purred , " my giant of Lannister . ";Bronn;Shae,Tyrion,;0.0;13939;444
Shae was shaking him by the shoulder . " M'lord , " she whispered . " Wake up , m'lord . I 'm frightened . ";Shae;Bronn,Tyrion,;0.0;13944;444
He heard shouts , the clatter of spears , the whicker of horses , though nothing yet that spoke to him of fighting . " My lord father 's trumpets , " he said . " Battle assembly . I thought Stark was yet a day 's march away . ";Bronn;Stark,;-0.2;13947;444
Tyrion gave him a sharp poke in the ribs with his toe . " My armor , " he said , " and be quick about it . ";Tyrion;Bronn,Shae,;0.104166666667;13956;445
Bronn came trotting out of the mists , already armored and ahorse , wearing his battered halfhelm . " Do you know what 's happened ? ";Bronn;Tyrion,Shae,;0.0;13957;445
" The Stark boy stole a march on us , " Bronn said . " He crept down the kingsroad in the night , and now his host is less than a mile north of here , forming up in battle array . ";Bronn;Tyrion,Shae,;-0.174074074074;13959;445
" See that the clansmen are ready to ride . ";Shae;Tyrion,Bronn,;0.2;13961;445
Tyrion ducked back inside his tent . " Where are my clothes ? ";Tyrion;Bronn,Shae,;0.0;13962;445
he barked at Shae . " There . No , the leather , damn it . Yes . Bring me my boots . ";Shae;Tyrion,Bronn,;0.0;13963;445
Shae helped Pod with the buckles and clasps . " If I die , weep for me , " Tyrion told the whore .;Shae;;0.0;13970;446
" How will you know ? You 'll be dead . ";Shae;;-0.2;13971;446
" I 'll know . ";Shae;;0.0;13972;446
" I believe you would . ";Shae;;0.0;13973;446
Shae stepped back and looked him over . " M'lord looks fearsome . ";Shae;Lords,;0.0;13980;447
" M'lord looks a dwarf in mismatched armor , " Tyrion answered sourly , " but I thank you for the kindness . Podrick , should the battle go against us , see the lady safely home . ";Tyrion;Lords,;0.0;13981;447
Bronn took one look at him and grinned . " Always follow a big man into battle . ";Bronn;Tyrion,Gregor,Shagga,;0.0;14030;448
Tyrion threw him a hard look . " And why is that ? ";Tyrion;Bronn,Gregor,Shagga,;-0.291666666667;14031;448
" They make such splendid targets . That one , he 'll draw the eyes of every bowman on the field . ";Gregor;Bronn,Tyrion,Shagga,;0.416666666667;14032;448
Laughing , Tyrion regarded the Mountain with fresh eyes . " I confess , I had not considered it in that light . ";Tyrion;Bronn,Gregor,Shagga,;0.35;14033;448
He was pointing men into position with his blade , a two-handed greatsword that Ser Gregor waved about with one hand as a lesser man might wave a dagger . " Any man runs , I 'll cut him down myself , " he was roaring when he caught sight of Tyrion . " Imp ! Take the left . Hold the river . If you can . ";Gregor;Bronn,Tyrion,Shagga,;-0.0648148148148;14035;448
Tyrion led his men toward the riverbank . " Look , " he shouted , pointing with his axe . " The river . ";Tyrion;Bronn,Gregor,Shagga,;0.0;14038;448
The shallows were muddy and choked with reeds . " That river is ours . Whatever happens , keep close to the water . Never lose sight of it . Let no enemy come between us and our river . If they dirty our waters , hack off their cocks and feed them to the fishes . ";Gregor;Bronn,Tyrion,Shagga,;-0.6;14040;448
He smashed them together and made them ring . " Halfman ! ";Shagga;Bronn,Tyrion,Gregor,;0.0;14042;448
The Burned Men did not shout , but they rattled their swords and spears . " Halfman ! Halfman ! Halfman ! ";Tyrion;Bronn,Gregor,Shagga,;0.0;14045;448
" Crow food , " Bronn muttered beside him , giving voice to what Tyrion had left unsaid .;Bronn;;0.0;14053;449
Tyrion put his spurs to his horse and added one more voice to the cacophony , and the van surged forward . " The river ! ";Tyrion;;0.625;14078;450
he shouted at his clansmen as they rode . " Remember , hew to the river . ";Tyrion;;0.0;14079;450
Tyrion shouted , " Burned Men ! Moon Brothers ! After me ! ";Tyrion;;0.0;14093;451
Tyrion aimed a swipe at his face , but the tall man slammed it aside . " Dwarf , " he screamed . " Die . ";Tyrion;Bronn,;0.0;14121;452
Where in the seven hells was Bronn ? " Die , " the man grunted , chopping at him savagely .;Bronn;Tyrion,;0.0;14124;452
The shattered pieces fell away from his arm . " Die ! ";Tyrion;Bronn,;0.0;14126;452
Tyrion buried his axe in his head . " You die , " he told him , and he did .;Tyrion;Bronn,;0.0;14132;452
As he wrenched the blade free , he heard a shout . " Eddard ! ";Tyrion;Bronn,;0.5;14133;452
a voice rang out . " For Eddard and Winterfell ! ";Tyrion;Bronn,;0.0;14134;452
The knight who had felled him drew up above him . " Tyrion the Imp , " he boomed down . " You are mine . Do you yield , Lannister ? ";Tyrion;;-0.0777777777778;14143;453
" Do you yield ? ";Tyrion;;0.0;14147;453
Tyrion 's hands were numb , his vision blurred , his scabbard empty . " Yield or die , " the knight declared , his flail whirling faster and faster .;Tyrion;;-0.35;14151;453
He wriggled free , his throat so tight he could scarce talk . " ... yield ... ";Tyrion;;0.110714285714;14156;453
" Yes , " a voice moaned , thick with pain .;Tyrion;;-0.3;14158;453
The knight 's leg was trapped , the arm he'd used to break his fall twisted at a grotesque angle . " Yield , " he repeated .;Tyrion;;-0.525;14161;453
Fumbling at his belt with his good hand , he drew a sword and flung it at Tyrion 's feet . " I yield , my lord . ";Tyrion;;0.65;14162;453
As he watched , the air filled with arrows again , and the men behind the oak wall crumbled beneath the murderous fire . " I believe you are losing , ser , " he told the knight under the horse .;Tyrion;Bronn,;0.0;14170;454
" Small use you turned out to be , " Tyrion told him .;Tyrion;Bronn,;-0.25;14174;454
" It would seem you did well enough on your own , " Bronn answered . " You 've lost the spike off your helm , though . ";Bronn;Tyrion,;0.3;14175;454
The spike had snapped off clean . " I have n't lost it . I know just where it is . Do you see my horse ? ";Tyrion;Bronn,;0.366666666667;14177;454
Tyrion thought they were both dead , but as he dismounted , Shagga opened his eyes and said , " They have killed Conn son of Coratt . ";Tyrion;;-0.2;14187;455
Lord Tywin was seated by the river , sipping wine from a jeweled cup as his squire undid the fastenings on his breastplate . " A fine victory , " Ser Kevan said when he saw Tyrion . " Your wild men fought well . ";Lord;Tyrion,Addam,;0.258333333333;14195;456
His father 's eyes were on him , pale green flecked with gold , so cool they gave Tyrion a chill . " Did that surprise you , Father ? ";Addam;Lord,Tyrion,;0.075;14196;456
he asked . " Did it upset your plans ? We were supposed to be butchered , were we not ? ";Tyrion;Lord,Addam,;0.0;14197;456
Lord Tywin drained his cup , his face expressionless . " I put the least disciplined men on the left , yes . I anticipated that they would break . Robb Stark is a green boy , more like to be brave than wise . I'd hoped that if he saw our left collapse , he might plunge into the gap , eager for a rout . Once he was fully committed , Ser Kevan 's pikes would wheel and take him in the flank , driving him into the river while I brought up the reserve . ";Lord;Robb,;0.1625;14198;456
" And you thought it best to place me in the midst of this carnage , yet keep me ignorant of your plans . ";Addam;Lord,Tyrion,;1.0;14199;456
" A feigned rout is less convincing , " his father said , " and I am not inclined to trust my plans to a man who consorts with sellswords and savages . ";Lord;Tyrion,Addam,;0.166666666667;14200;456
" A pity my savages ruined your dance . ";Addam;Lord,Tyrion,;0.0;14201;456
" The Stark boy proved more cautious than I expected for one of his years , " Lord Tywin admitted , " but a victory is a victory . You appear to be wounded . ";Lord;Tyrion,Addam,;0.0666666666667;14203;456
Tyrion 's right arm was soaked with blood . " Good of you to notice , Father , " he said through clenched teeth . " Might I trouble you to send for your maesters ? Unless you relish the notion of having a one-armed dwarf for a son ... ";Tyrion;Lord,Addam,;0.467857142857;14204;456
An urgent shout of " Lord Tywin ! ";Lord;Tyrion,Addam,;0.0;14205;456
Ser Addam dropped to one knee , a rangy man with dark copper hair that fell to his shoulders , armored in burnished bronzed steel with the fiery tree of his House etched black on his breastplate . " My liege , we have taken some of their commanders . Lord Cerwyn , Ser Wylis Manderly , Harrion Karstark , four Freys . Lord Hornwood is dead , and I fear Roose Bolton has escaped us . ";Addam;Hornwood,;-0.172222222222;14209;456
" And the boy ? ";Lord;Tyrion,Addam,;0.0;14210;456
Ser Addam hesitated . " The Stark boy was not with them , my lord . They say he crossed at the Twins with the great part of his horse , riding hard for Riverrun . ";Addam;Lord,Tyrion,;0.102777777778;14212;456
" It should not be long now , my lady , " Hallis Mollen said .;Mollen;Catelyn,;-0.05;14222;457
" It will come when it comes , " Catelyn told him .;Catelyn;Mollen,;0.0;14227;457
Her men had always made her wait . " Watch for me , little cat , " her father would always tell her , when he rode off to court or fair or battle .;Catelyn;Bran,;0.25625;14234;458
He did not always come when he said he would , and days would ofttimes pass as Catelyn stood her vigil , peering out between crenels and through arrow loops until she caught a glimpse of Lord Hoster on his old brown gelding , trotting along the river-shore toward the landing . " Did you watch for me ? ";Catelyn;Bran,;0.1;14236;458
he'd ask when he bent to hug her . " Did you , little cat ? ";Catelyn;Bran,;-0.1875;14237;458
Brandon Stark had bid her wait as well . " I shall not be long , my lady , " he had vowed . " We will be wed on my return . ";Bran;Catelyn,;-0.125;14238;458
for Robb , and for Jaime Lannister , the gilded knight who men said had never learned to wait at all . " The Kingslayer is restless , and quick to anger , " her uncle Brynden had told Robb .;Brynden;King,;-0.183333333333;14247;459
Robb had given the Blackfish three hundred picked men , and sent them ahead to screen his march . " Jaime does not know , " Ser Brynden said when he rode back . " I 'll stake my life on that . No bird has reached him , my archers have seen to that . We 've seen a few of his outriders , but those that saw us did not live to tell of it . He ought to have sent out more . He does not know . ";Robb;Jaime,;0.109090909091;14265;460
" How large is his host ? ";Brynden;Robb,Glover,Twins,;0.214285714286;14266;460
" Twelve thousand foot , scattered around the castle in three separate camps , with the rivers between , " her uncle said , with the craggy smile she remembered so well . " There is no other way to besiege Riverrun , yet still , that will be their undoing . Two or three thousand horse . ";Twins;Riverrun,;0.0875;14268;460
" The Kingslayer has us three to one , " said Galbart Glover .;Glover;King,;0.0;14269;460
" True enough , " Ser Brynden said , " yet there is one thing Ser Jaime lacks . ";Brynden;Jaime,;0.175;14270;460
" Yes ? ";Robb;Glover,Brynden,Twins,;0.0;14271;460
" Patience . ";Twins;Robb,Glover,Brynden,;0.0;14273;460
When Robb turned his head to look at her , she could see only black inside his visor . " I must ride down the line , Mother , " he told her . " Father says you should let the men see you before a battle . ";Robb;Father,;-0.107407407407;14282;461
" Go , then , " she said . " Let them see you . ";Robb;;0.0;14283;461
" It will give them courage , " Robb said .;Robb;;0.0;14284;461
Some of the other lords muttered about that , but Catelyn would not listen to their complaints . " This is not about the honor of your houses , " she told them . " This is about keeping my son alive and whole . ";Catelyn;;0.0583333333333;14293;462
" They 're coming , my lady , " Hal Mollen whispered .;Hal;;0.0;14303;463
He was always a man for stating the obvious . " Gods be with us . ";Hal;Gods,;0.0;14304;463
" He is no man for sitting in a tent while his carpenters build siege towers , " Ser Brynden had promised . " He has ridden out with his knights thrice already , to chase down raiders or storm a stubborn holdfast . ";Brynden;Ned,;-0.155555555556;14319;464
Ned had taught him to read maps . " Raid him here , " he said , pointing . " A few hundred men , no more . Tully banners . When he comes after you , we will be waiting"-his finger moved an inch to the left-"here . ";Ned;Brynden,;0.15;14321;464
All around her , the riders raised their lances , and the dirt and leaves that had buried the cruel bright points fell away to reveal the gleam of sharpened steel . " Winterfell ! ";Robb;;-0.1875;14335;465
The crack of a broken lance , the clash of swords , the cries of " Lannister " and " Winterfell " and " Tully ! Riverrun and Tully ! ";Robb;;-0.625;14347;466
Once she heard Robb 's voice , as clear as if he'd been standing at her side , calling , " To me ! To me ! ";Robb;;0.15625;14353;466
Yet when he came closer , Catelyn saw that his mailed glove and the sleeve of his surcoat were black with blood . " You 're hurt , " she said .;Catelyn;Robb,Hal,Lannister,Blood,Greyjoy,Greatjon,Glover,;-0.166666666667;14361;467
Robb lifted his hand , opened and closed his fingers . " No , " he said . " This is ... Torrhen 's blood , perhaps , or ... ";Robb;Catelyn,Hal,Lannister,Blood,Greyjoy,Greatjon,Glover,;-0.1;14362;467
He shook his head . " I do not know . ";Catelyn;Robb,Hal,Lannister,Blood,Greyjoy,Greatjon,Glover,;0.0;14363;467

Lannister raised his head . " Lady Stark , " he said from his knees .;Lannister;Catelyn,Robb,Hal,Blood,Greyjoy,Greatjon,Glover,;-0.2;14367;467
Blood ran down one cheek from a gash across his scalp , but the pale light of dawn had put the glint of gold back in his hair . " I would offer you my sword , but I seem to have mislaid it . ";Blood;Catelyn,Robb,Hal,Lannister,Greyjoy,Greatjon,Glover,;0.0814814814815;14368;467
" It is not your sword I want , ser , " she told him . " Give me my father and my brother Edmure . Give me my daughters . Give me my lord husband . ";Robb;Edmure,;0.0;14369;467
" I have mislaid them as well , I fear . ";Greyjoy;Catelyn,Robb,Hal,Lannister,Blood,Greatjon,Glover,;0.0;14370;467

" No , " her son answered , peeling off his bloody glove . " He 's more use alive than dead . And my lord father never condoned the murder of prisoners after a battle . ";Robb;Catelyn,Hal,Lannister,Blood,Greyjoy,Greatjon,Glover,;-0.1;14373;467

" That he will , " the Greatjon agreed , gesturing .;Greatjon;Catelyn,Robb,Hal,Lannister,Blood,Greyjoy,Glover,;0.0;14377;467
" Why should Lord Karstark want him dead ? ";Catelyn;Lord,;-0.2;14379;467
Robb looked away into the woods , with the same brooding look that Ned often got . " He ... he killed them ... ";Robb;Catelyn,Hal,Lannister,Blood,Greyjoy,Greatjon,Glover,;0.0;14381;467
" Lord Karstark 's sons , " Galbart Glover explained .;Glover;Catelyn,Robb,Hal,Lannister,Blood,Greyjoy,Greatjon,;0.0;14382;467
" Both of them , " said Robb . " Torrhen and Eddard . And Daryn Hornwood as well . ";Robb;Catelyn,Hal,Lannister,Blood,Greyjoy,Greatjon,Glover,;0.0;14383;467
" No one can fault Lannister on his courage , " Glover said . " When he saw that he was lost , he rallied his retainers and fought his way up the valley , hoping to reach Lord Robb and cut him down . And almost did . ";Glover;Lannister,;-0.155555555556;14384;467
" He mislaid his sword in Eddard Karstark 's neck , after he took Torrhen 's hand off and split Daryn Hornwood 's skull open , " Robb said . " All the time he was shouting for me . If they had n't tried to stop him - ";Robb;Torrhen,;0.0;14385;467
" - I should then be mourning in place of Lord Karstark , " Catelyn said . " Your men did what they were sworn to do , Robb . They died protecting their liege lord . Grieve for them . Honor them for their valor . But not now . You have no time for grief . You may have lopped the head off the snake , but three quarters of the body is still coiled around my father 's castle .

" But such a battle ! ";Robb;Catelyn,Hal,Lannister,Blood,Greyjoy,Greatjon,Glover,;0.0;14387;467
said Theon Greyjoy eagerly . " My lady , the realm has not seen such a victory since the Field of Fire . I vow , the Lannisters lost ten men for every one of ours that fell .

" Until you do , this war is far from done . ";Catelyn;Robb,Hal,Lannister,Blood,Greyjoy,Greatjon,Glover,;0.1;14392;467

Dany pressed her heels into her silver and rode closer . " My lord , " she said softly . " Drogo . My sun-and-stars . ";Dany;Cohollo,Drogo,Haggo,Qotho,;0.0;14431;468
Dany gasped , " Drogo , " Clumsily she reached over and touched his arm .;Dany;Cohollo,Drogo,Haggo,Qotho,;0.0;14434;468
" No , " Dany said , reining up .;Dany;Cohollo,Drogo,Haggo,Qotho,;0.0;14437;468
His breath rattled harshly in his throat , and he looked at her without recognition . " My horse , " he gasped .;Qotho;Dany,Cohollo,Drogo,Haggo,;0.0;14441;468
Cohollo vaulted from his horse . " Blood of my blood , " he said as he dropped to his knees .;Cohollo;Dany,Drogo,Haggo,Qotho,;0.0;14446;468
" No , " Khal Drogo groaned , struggling in Dany 's arms . " Must ride . Ride . No . ";Drogo;Dany,Cohollo,Haggo,Qotho,;0.0;14448;468

" You must not say that , " Dany told him . " We have ridden far enough today . We will camp here . ";Dany;Cohollo,Drogo,Haggo,Qotho,;0.05;14451;468
" Here ? ";Qotho;Dany,Cohollo,Drogo,Haggo,;0.0;14452;468
The land was brown and sere , inhospitable . " This is no camping ground . ";Dany;Cohollo,Drogo,Haggo,Qotho,;0.0;14454;468
" It is not for a woman to bid us halt , " said Qotho , " not even a khaleesi . ";Qotho;Dany,Cohollo,Drogo,Haggo,;0.0;14455;468
" We camp here , " Dany repeated . " Haggo , tell them Khal Drogo commanded the halt . If any ask why , say to them that my time is near and I could not continue . Cohollo , bring up the slaves , they must put up the khal 's tent at once . Qotho - ";Dany;Drogo,;0.1;14456;468

Qotho glared down at her , his eyes hard as flint . " The maegi . ";Qotho;Dany,Cohollo,Drogo,Haggo,;-0.223611111111;14460;468
He spat . " This I will not do . ";Drogo;Dany,Cohollo,Haggo,Qotho,;0.0;14461;468
" You will , " Dany said , " or when Drogo wakes , he will hear why you defied me . ";Dany;Drogo,;0.0;14462;468

When her khas came up , she posted them outside at guard . " Admit no one without my leave , " she told Jhogo . " No one . ";Jhogo;Drogo,Eroeh,Dany,Jhiqui,;0.0;14474;469
Eroeh stared fearfully at Drogo where he lay . " He dies , " she whispered .;Eroeh;Drogo,Jhogo,Dany,Jhiqui,;0.0;14475;469
Dany slapped her . " The khal cannot die . He is the father of the stallion who mounts the world . His hair has never been cut . He still wears the bells his father gave him . ";Dany;khal,;0.0;14476;469

" We must bathe him , " she said stubbornly .;Drogo;Irri,Aggo,Dothraki,Dany,;0.0;14484;470

" Qotho will find her , " Irri said .;Irri;Qotho,;0.0;14492;470
A breath of air entered the tent as Aggo poked his head through the silk . " Khaleesi , " he said , " the Andal is come , and begs leave to enter . ";Aggo;Andal,;0.0;14498;470
" The Andal " was what the Dothraki called Ser Jorah . " Yes , " she said , rising clumsily , " send him in . ";Dothraki;Drogo,Irri,Aggo,Dany,;0.0;14499;470
Under a bleached white vest , he was bare-chested , skin reddened by the sun . " Talk goes from mouth to ear , all over the khalasar , " he said . " It is said Khal Drogo fell from his horse . ";Drogo;Drogo,;0.0;14505;470
" Help him , " Dany pleaded . " For the love you say you bear me , help him now . ";Dany;Drogo,Irri,Aggo,Dothraki,;0.5;14506;470

Ser Jorah gave a bitter laugh . " Khaleesi or queen , that command is beyond your power . Save your tears , child . Weep for him tomorrow , or a year from now . We do not have time for grief . We must go , and quickly , before he dies . ";Jorah;Dany,Drogo,Mirri,Qotho,Mormont,;-0.2;14523;471
Dany was lost . " Go ? Where should we go ? ";Dany;Jorah,Drogo,Mirri,Qotho,Mormont,;0.0;14524;471
" Asshai , I would say . It lies far to the south , at the end of the known world , yet men say it is a great port . We will find a ship to take us back to Pentos .

She touched the swell of her belly . " I do n't understand . Why should we flee ? I am khaleesi . I carry Drogo 's heir . He will be khal after Drogo ... ";Mirri;Drogo,;0.0;14527;471
Ser Jorah frowned . " Princess , hear me . The Dothraki will not follow a suckling babe . Drogo 's strength was what they bowed to , and only that .

she cried plaintively . " Why should they kill a little baby ? ";Mirri;Dany,Jorah,Drogo,Qotho,Mormont,;-0.1875;14530;471
" He is Drogo 's son , and the crones say he will be the stallion who mounts the world . It was prophesied . Better to kill the child than to risk his fury when he grows to manhood . ";Dany;Drogo,;0.5;14531;471
That was the way of men . " They must not hurt my son ! ";Mirri;Dany,Jorah,Drogo,Qotho,Mormont,;0.0;14535;471

Ser Jorah held her by the shoulders . " A bloodrider dies with his khal . You know that , child . They will take you to Vaes Dothrak , to the crones , that is the last duty they owe him in life ... when it is done , they will join Drogo in the night lands . ";Jorah;Drogo,;0.0;14537;471
Drogo had been more than her sun-and-stars ; he had been the shield that kept her safe . " I will not leave him , " she said stubbornly , miserably .;Drogo;Dany,Jorah,Mirri,Qotho,Mormont,;0.5;14539;471

Qotho pulled Haggo away , saying , " Kicks are too merciful for a maegi . Take her outside . We will stake her to the earth , to be the mount of every passing man .

Qotho 's lips skinned back from his crooked brown teeth in a terrible mockery of a smile . " No ? You say me no ? Better you should pray that we do not stake you out beside your maegi . You did this , as much as the other . ";Qotho;Dany,Jorah,Drogo,Mirri,Mormont,;-0.0321428571429;14555;471

" Yes , " Dany admitted .;Dany;Jorah,Drogo,Mirri,Qotho,Mormont,;0.0;14573;471

" I am khaleesi , and I say it is not forbidden . In Vaes Dothrak , Khal Drogo slew a stallion and I ate his heart , to give our son strength and courage . This is the same . The same . ";Dany;Drogo,;0.0;14619;471
He would have collapsed , but the men of her khas held him up . " Strength of the mount , go into the rider , " Mirri sang as horse blood swirled into the waters of Drogo 's bath . " Strength of the beast , go into the man . ";Mirri;Dany,Jorah,Drogo,Qotho,Mormont,;0.0;14625;471
Mirri Maz Duur had no use for the carcass . " Burn it , " Dany told them .;Mirri;Dany,Jorah,Drogo,Qotho,Mormont,;0.0;14630;471
She sent her handmaids away . " Go with them , Silver Lady , " Mirri Maz Duur told her .;Mirri;Dany,Drogo,;0.0;14640;472
" I will stay , " Dany said . " The man took me under the stars and gave life to the child inside me . I will not leave him . ";Dany;Mirri,Drogo,;0.0;14641;472
" You must . Once I begin to sing , no one must enter this tent . My song will wake powers old and dark . The dead will dance here this night . No living man must look on them . ";Mirri;Dany,Drogo,;-0.0833333333333;14642;472
Dany bowed her head , helpless . " No one will enter . ";Dany;Mirri,Drogo,;0.0;14643;472
She bent over the tub , over Drogo in his bath of blood , and kissed him lightly on the brow . " Bring him back to me , " she whispered to Mirri Maz Duur before she fled .;Drogo;Mirri,Dany,;0.0;14644;472
When he saw the scarlet footprints her boots had left on the ground , the color seemed to drain from his face . " What have you done , you little fool ? ";Dany;Jorah,Haggo,Qotho,;-0.09375;14653;473
" I had to save him . ";Qotho;Dany,Jorah,Haggo,;0.0;14655;473

Ser Jorah grimaced . " Would that I knew how . ";Jorah;Dany,Haggo,Qotho,;0.0;14661;473
Dany saw naked fear on the faces of the Dothraki . " This must not be , " Qotho thundered .;Dany;Jorah,Haggo,Qotho,;0.0;14667;473
" This will be , " Dany replied .;Dany;Jorah,Haggo,Qotho,;0.0;14671;473
" Maegi , " Haggo growled .;Haggo;Dany,Jorah,Qotho,;0.0;14672;473
" You will die , maegi , " Qotho promised , " but the other must die first . ";Qotho;other,;0.0625;14674;473
" No , " she shouted , " you must n't . ";Jorah;Dany,Haggo,Qotho,;0.0;14676;473
Dany fell to her knees , crossing her arms over her belly to protect the child within . " Stop him , " she commanded her khas , " kill him . ";Dany;Jorah,Haggo,Qotho,;0.0;14678;473
Qotho wrenched the blade free . " Horselord , " Ser Jorah Mormont called . " Try me . ";Qotho;Dany,Jorah,Haggo,;0.4;14683;473
Qotho screamed taunts at him , calling him a craven , a milk man , a eunuch in an iron suit . " You die now ! ";Qotho;;0.0;14694;474
Someone threw a stone , and when Dany looked , her shoulder was torn and bloody . " No , " she wept , " no , please , stop it , it 's too high , the price is too high . ";Dany;Cohollo,;-0.16;14710;475
Fingers in her hair , he pulled her head back and she felt the cold touch of his knife at her throat . " My baby , " she screamed , and perhaps the gods heard , for as quick as that , Cohollo was dead .;Cohollo;Dany,;-0.116666666667;14713;475
It felt as if her son had a knife in each hand , as if he were hacking at her to cut his way out . " Doreah , curse you , " Ser Jorah roared . " Come here . Fetch the birthing women . ";Jorah;Doreah,Aggo,Irri,;0.0;14729;476

Was that Aggo ? " Take her to the maegi . ";Aggo;Jorah,Doreah,Irri,;0.0;14734;476

A passing septon was looking at her askance . " Here 's the best place to find pigeon , " Arya told him as she brushed herself off and picked up her fallen stick sword . " They come for the crumbs . ";Arya;;0.5;14761;477
Her stomach made a hollow rumbly noise . " Could I have one ? ";Arya;;0.0;14765;477
she heard herself say . " A lemon , or ... or any kind . ";Arya;;0.6;14766;477
Plainly he did not like what he saw . " Three coppers . ";Arya;;0.0;14768;477
Arya tapped her wooden sword against the side of her boot . " I 'll trade you a fat pigeon , " she said .;Arya;;0.0;14769;477
" The Others take your pigeon , " the pushcart man said .;Arya;;0.0;14770;477
She was just thinking that if she snatched a tart and ran he would never be able to catch her when he said , " You be keepin ' your filthy hands off . The gold cloaks know how to deal with thieving little gutter rats , that they do . ";Arya;keepin,;-0.1625;14776;477
In the Bottom there were pot-shops along the alleys where huge tubs of stew had been simmering for years , and you could trade half your bird for a heel of yesterday 's bread and a " bowl o ' brown , " and they'd even stick the other half in the fire and crisp it up for you , so long as you plucked the feathers yourself .;Bottom;;0.0236111111111;14813;478
She would have given anything if Jon had been here to call her " little sister " and muss her hair .;Jon;;-0.1875;14844;479
She grabbed a passing longshoreman by the sleeve . " Please , " she said , " what ship is this ? ";Arya;;0.0;14868;480
" She 's the Wind Witch , out of Myr , " the man said .;Arya;;0.0;14869;480
" She 's still here , " Arya blurted .;Arya;;0.0;14870;480
The three in the grey cloaks were strangers . " You , " the one walking rounds called out . " What do you want here , boy ? ";She'd;;-0.05;14882;481
She'd be a boy , then . " Want to buy a pigeon ? ";She'd;;0.0;14887;481
" Get out of here , " the guardsman said .;She'd;;0.0;14889;481
" What 's this now ? ";Arya;;0.0;14902;482
" The bells again , gods ha ' mercy , " wailed an old woman .;Arya;;0.1;14904;482
A red-haired whore in a wisp of painted silk pushed open a second-story window . " Is it the boy king that 's died now ? ";Arya;;0.0;14905;482
she shouted down , leaning out over the street . " Ah , that 's a boy for you , they never last long . ";Arya;;-0.0685185185185;14906;482
" Stupid slut , " the fat man shouted up . " The king 's not dead , that 's only summoning bells . One tower tolling . When the king dies , they ring every bell in the city . ";Arya;;-0.333333333333;14908;482
" Here , quit your biting , or I 'll ring your bells , " the woman in the window said to the man behind her , pushing him off with an elbow . " So who is it died , if not the king ? ";Arya;;-0.4;14909;482
" It 's a summoning , " the fat man repeated .;Arya;;0.0;14910;482
Arya ran after the slower boy . " Where you going ? ";Arya;;0.0;14914;482
she shouted when she was right behind him . " What 's happening ? ";Arya;;-0.0571428571429;14915;482
He glanced back without slowing . " The gold cloaks is carryin ' him to the sept . ";Arya;;0.0;14916;482
" Who ? ";Arya;;0.0;14917;482
" The Hand ! They 'll be taking his head off , Buu says . ";Arya;Buu,;0.0;14919;482
" Make way ! ";earth;;0.0;14928;483
someone shouted from the cross street . " Make way for my lords of Redwyne ! ";earth;;0.0;14929;483
" - the King 's Hand , Lord Stark . They 're carrying him up to Baelor 's Sept . ";Arya;Street,;-0.2;14941;484
" I heard he was dead . ";Arya;Street,;-0.2;14942;484
" Soon enough , soon enough . Here , I got me a silver stag says they lop his head off . ";Arya;Street,;0.0;14943;484
" Past time , the traitor . ";Arya;Street,;-0.25;14944;484
Arya struggled to find a voice . " He never - " she started , but she was only a child and they talked right over her .;Arya;Street,;0.142857142857;14946;484
" Fool ! They ai n't neither going to lop him . Since when do they knick traitors on the steps of the Great Sept ? ";Arya;Street,;0.8;14947;484
" Well , they do n't mean to anoint him no knight . I heard it was Stark killed old King Robert . Slit his throat in the woods , and when they found him , he stood there cool as you please and said it was some old boar did for His Grace . ";Arya;Stark,;0.0075;14948;484
" Ah , that 's not true , it was his own brother did him , that Renly , him with his gold antlers . ";Arya;Street,;0.475;14949;484
" You shut your lying mouth , woman . You do n't know what you 're saying , his lordship 's a fine true man . ";Street;Arya,;0.383333333333;14950;484
People behind her began to shout out , " What ? ";Arya;;-0.4;14979;485
and " Louder ! ";Arya;;0.0;14980;485
Her father raised his voice and began again . " I am Eddard Stark , Lord of Winterfell and Hand of the King , " he said more loudly , his voice carrying across the plaza , " and I come before you to confess my treason in the sight of gods and men . ";Arya;Stark,;0.15;14985;485
" NO , " Arya whimpered .;Arya;;0.0;14986;485
Her father raised his voice still higher , straining to be heard . " I betrayed the faith of my king and the trust of my friend , Robert , " he shouted . " I swore to defend and protect his children , yet before his blood was cold , I plotted to depose and murder his son and seize the throne for myself . Let the High Septon and Baelor the Beloved and the Seven bear witness to the truth of what I say : Joffrey Baratheon is the one true heir to the Iron Throne , and by the grace of all the gods , Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm . ";Arya;Joffrey,High,;0.172;14990;485
The High Septon knelt before Joffrey and his mother . " As we sin , so do we suffer , " he intoned , in a deep swelling voice much louder than Father ' s. " This man has confessed his crimes in the sight of gods and men , here in this holy place . ";High;King,moment,;0.0866666666667;15003;486
Rainbows danced around his head as he lifted his hands in entreaty . " The gods are just , yet Blessed Baelor taught us that they are also merciful . What shall be done with this traitor , Your Grace ? ";moment;Baelor,;0.0;15004;486
stepped out from behind the shields of his Kingsguard . " My mother bids me let Lord Eddard take the black , and Lady Sansa has begged mercy for her father . ";King;Lord,;-0.283333333333;15008;486
He looked straight at Sansa then , and smiled , and for a moment Arya thought that the gods had heard her prayer , until Joffrey turned back to the crowd and said , " But they have the soft hearts of women . So long as I am your king , treason shall never go unpunished . Ser Ilyn , bring me his head ! ";moment;High,King,;0.1725;15009;486
" Here , you ! ";Arya;;0.0;15023;487
A face pressed close to hers , long black hair and tangled beard and rotten teeth . " Do n't look ! ";Arya;;-0.135416666667;15036;488
" I ... I ... I ... ";Arya;;0.0;15038;488
The old man shook her so hard her teeth rattled . " Shut your mouth and close your eyes , boy . ";Arya;;-0.0958333333333;15040;488
The old man 's fingers dug into her arm , stiff as iron . " Look at me . Yes , that 's the way of it , at me . ";Arya;;-0.0571428571429;15044;488
Sour wine perfumed his breath . " Remember , boy ? ";Arya;;0.0;15045;488
" Know me now , do you ? There 's a bright boy . ";Arya;;0.7;15049;488
He spat . " They 're done here . You 'll be coming with me , and you 'll be keeping your mouth shut . ";Arya;;0.0;15050;488
When she started to reply , he shook her again , even harder . " Shut , I said . ";Arya;;-0.1;15051;488
She did not recall him finding Needle , until he handed the sword back to her . " Hope you can use that , boy . ";Arya;;0.0;15057;488
" I 'm not - " she started .;Arya;;0.0;15058;488
He shoved her into a doorway , thrust dirty fingers through her hair , and gave it a twist , yanking her head back . " - not a smart boy , that what you mean to say ? ";Arya;;-0.174553571429;15059;488
Bran had never seen the old knight look so fierce . " No , " he kept saying . " No . No . No . ";Bran;Maester,Tom,Rodrik,Luwin,Hodor,;0.1;15071;489
" They do n't fight very well , " Bran said dubiously .;Bran;Maester,Tom,Rodrik,Luwin,Hodor,;0.2;15072;489
" For a certainty , " Maester Luwin agreed with a deep sigh .;Maester;Bran,Tom,Rodrik,Luwin,Hodor,;0.0;15075;489
The maester was peering through his big Myrish lens tube , measuring shadows and noting the position of the comet that hung low in the morning sky . " Yet given time ... Ser Rodrik has the truth of it , we need men to walk the walls . Your lord father took the cream of his guard to King 's Landing , and your brother took the rest , along with all the likely lads for leagues around . Many will not come back to us , and we must needs find the men to take their places . ";Luwin;Rodrik,;0.1;15076;489
Bran stared resentfully at the sweating boys below . " If I still had my legs , I could beat them all . ";Bran;Maester,Tom,Rodrik,Luwin,Hodor,;0.0;15077;489
It was only a wooden sword , yet he'd knocked Prince Tommen down half a hundred times . " Ser Rodrik should teach me to use a poleaxe . If I had a poleaxe with a big long haft , Hodor could be my legs . We could be a knight together . ";Tom;Rodrik,Hodor,;-0.062037037037;15079;489
" I think that ... unlikely , " Maester Luwin said . " Bran , when a man fights , his arms and legs and thoughts must be as one . ";Maester;Bran,Tom,Rodrik,Luwin,Hodor,;-0.5;15080;489
Below in the yard , Ser Rodrik was yelling . " You fight like a goose . He pecks you and you peck him harder . Parry ! Block the blow . Goose fighting will not suffice . If those were real swords , the first peck would take your arm off ! ";Rodrik;Goose,;0.09375;15081;489
One of the other boys laughed , and the old knight rounded on him . " You laugh . You . Now that is gall . You fight like a hedgehog ... ";Maester;Bran,Tom,Rodrik,Luwin,Hodor,;0.24375;15082;489
" There was a knight once who could n't see , " Bran said stubbornly , as Ser Rodrik went on below . " Old Nan told me about him . He had a long staff with blades at both ends and he could spin it in his hands and chop two men at once . ";Bran;Nan,;0.025;15083;489
" Symeon Star-Eyes , " Luwin said as he marked numbers in a book . " When he lost his eyes , he put star sapphires in the empty sockets , or so the singers claim . Bran , that is only a story , like the tales of Florian the Fool . A fable from the Age of Heroes . ";Luwin;Bran,Maester,Tom,Rodrik,Hodor,;0.0;15084;489
The maester tsked . " You must put these dreams aside , they will only break your heart . ";Bran;Maester,Tom,Rodrik,Luwin,Hodor,;0.0;15085;489
The mention of dreams reminded him . " I dreamed about the crow again last night . The one with three eyes . He flew into my bedchamber and told me to come with him , so I did . We went down to the crypts . Father was there , and we talked . He was sad . ";Maester;Father,;-0.218518518519;15086;489
" And why was that ? ";Luwin;Bran,Maester,Tom,Rodrik,Hodor,;0.0;15087;489
" It was something to do about Jon , I think . ";Maester;Bran,Tom,Rodrik,Luwin,Hodor,;0.0;15089;489
The dream had been deeply disturbing , more so than any of the other crow dreams . " Hodor wo n't go down into the crypts . ";Bran;Hodor,;-0.0701388888889;15090;489
He lifted his eye from the tube , blinking . " Hodor wo n't ... ? ";Maester;Hodor,;0.0;15092;489
" Go down into the crypts . When I woke , I told him to take me down , to see if Father was truly there . At first he did n't know what I was saying , but I got him to the steps by telling him to go here and go there , only then he would n't go down . He just stood on the top step and said ' Hodor , ' like he was scared of the dark , but I had a torch . It made me so mad I almost gave him a swat in the head , like Old Nan is always doing . ";Bran;Father,Nan,;-0.0435185185185;15093;489
He saw the way the maester was frowning and hurriedly added , " I did n't , though . ";Maester;Bran,Tom,Rodrik,Luwin,Hodor,;0.0;15094;489
" Good . Hodor is a man , not a mule to be beaten . ";Luwin;Hodor,;0.65;15095;489
" In the dream I flew down with the crow , but I ca n't do that when I 'm awake , " Bran explained .;Bran;Maester,Tom,Rodrik,Luwin,Hodor,;-0.155555555556;15096;489
" Why would you want to go down to the crypts ? ";Maester;Bran,Tom,Rodrik,Luwin,Hodor,;-0.155555555556;15097;489
" I told you . To look for Father . ";Bran;Maester,Tom,Rodrik,Luwin,Hodor,;0.0;15098;489
The maester tugged at the chain around his neck , as he often did when he was uncomfortable . " Bran , sweet child , one day Lord Eddard will sit below in stone , beside his father and his father 's father and all the Starks back to the old Kings in the North ... but that will not be for many years , gods be good . Your father is a prisoner of the queen in King 's Landing . You will not find him in the crypts . ";Maester;day,;0.183333333333;15099;489
" He was there last night . I talked to him . ";Bran;Maester,Tom,Rodrik,Luwin,Hodor,;0.0;15100;489
" Stubborn boy , " the maester sighed , setting his book aside . " Would you like to go see ? ";Maester;Bran,Tom,Rodrik,Luwin,Hodor,;0.0;15101;489
" I ca n't . Hodor wo n't go , and the steps are too narrow and twisty for Dancer . ";Bran;Hodor,;-0.2;15102;489
" I believe I can solve that difficulty . ";Hodor;Bran,Maester,Tom,Rodrik,Luwin,;0.0;15103;489
She was tall and tough and uncomplaining , willing to go wherever she was commanded . " I lived my life beyond the Wall , a hole in the ground wo n't fret me none , m'lords , " she said .;Maester;Bran,Tom,Rodrik,Luwin,Hodor,;-0.0694444444444;15105;489
" Summer , come , " Bran called as she lifted him in wiry-strong arms .;Bran;Maester,Tom,Rodrik,Luwin,Hodor,;0.0;15106;489
Even Osha , hard as old iron , seemed uncomfortable . " Grim folk , by the look of them , " she said as she eyed the long row of granite Starks on their stone thrones .;Osha;Bran,Maester,Nan,Shaggydog,Rickon,Blood,Luwin,;-0.348333333333;15118;490
" They were the Kings of Winter , " Bran whispered .;Bran;King,;0.0;15119;490
Osha smiled . " Winter 's got no king . If you'd seen it , you'd know that , summer boy . ";Osha;Winterfell,;0.6;15121;490
" They were the Kings in the North for thousands of years , " Maester Luwin said , lifting the torch high so the light shone on the stone faces .;Maester;King,;0.28;15122;490
Others were shaved clean , their features gaunt and sharp-edged as the iron longswords across their laps . " Hard men for a hard time . Come . ";Osha;Bran,Maester,Nan,Shaggydog,Rickon,Blood,Luwin,;-0.0722222222222;15124;490
" Do you recall your history , Bran ? ";Bran;Osha,Maester,Nan,Shaggydog,Rickon,Blood,Luwin,;0.0;15130;490
the maester said as they walked . " Tell Osha who they were and what they did , if you can . ";Maester;Osha,;0.0;15131;490
The maester had told him the stories , and Old Nan had made them come alive . " That one is Jon Stark . When the sea raiders landed in the east , he drove them out and built the castle at White Harbor . His son was Rickard Stark , not my father 's father but another Rickard , he took the Neck away from the Marsh King and married his daughter . Theon Stark 's the real thin one with the long hair and the skinny beard . They called him the ' Hungry Wolf , ' because he was always at war . That 's a Brandon , the tall one with the dreamy face , he was Brandon the Shipwright , because he loved the sea . His tomb is empty . He tried to sail west across the Sunset Sea and was never seen again . His son was Brandon the Burner , because he put the torch to all his father 's ships in grief . There 's Rodrik Stark , who won Bear Island in a wrestling match and gave it to the Mormonts . And that 's Torrhen Stark , the King Who Knelt . He was the last King in the North and the first Lord of Winterfell , after he yielded to Aegon the Conqueror . Oh , there , he 's Cregan Stark . He fought with Prince Aemon once , and the Dragonknight said he'd never faced a finer swordsman . ";Nan;Stark,Dragon,Jon,Rickard,Young,Bran,Rodrik,Cregan,;-0.0583333333333;15133;490
They were almost at the end now , and Bran felt a sadness creeping over him . " And there 's my grandfather , Lord Rickard , who was beheaded by Mad King Aerys . His daughter Lyanna and his son Brandon are in the tombs beside him . Not me , another Brandon , my father 's brother . They 're not supposed to have statues , that 's only for the lords and the kings , but my father loved them so much he had them done . ";Bran;Bran,;0.04375;15134;490
" The maid 's a fair one , " Osha said .;Osha;Bran,Maester,Nan,Shaggydog,Rickon,Blood,Luwin,;0.7;15135;490
" Robert was betrothed to marry her , but Prince Rhaegar carried her off and raped her , " Bran explained . " Robert fought a war to win her back . He killed Rhaegar on the Trident with his hammer , but Lyanna died and he never got her back at all . ";Bran;Robert,Lyanna,Rhaegar,;0.266666666667;15136;490
" A sad tale , " said Osha , " but those empty holes are sadder . ";Osha;Bran,Maester,Nan,Shaggydog,Rickon,Blood,Luwin,;-0.3;15137;490
" Lord Eddard 's tomb , for when his time comes , " Maester Luwin said . " Is this where you saw your father in your dream , Bran ? ";Maester;Osha,Bran,Nan,Shaggydog,Rickon,Blood,Luwin,;0.0;15138;490
" Yes . ";Bran;Osha,Maester,Nan,Shaggydog,Rickon,Blood,Luwin,;0.0;15139;490

He thrust his arm into the blackness inside the tomb , as into the mouth of some great beast . " Do you see ? It 's quite empt - ";Osha;Bran,Maester,Nan,Shaggydog,Rickon,Blood,Luwin,;0.8;15145;490

" Shaggy , " a small voice called .;Maester;Osha,Bran,Nan,Shaggydog,Rickon,Blood,Luwin,;-0.25;15157;490
With one final snap at Summer 's face , Shaggydog broke off and bounded to Rickon 's side . " You let my father be , " Rickon warned Luwin . " You let him be . ";Shaggydog;Osha,Bran,Maester,Nan,Rickon,Blood,Luwin,;0.0;15159;490
" Rickon , " Bran said softly . " Father 's not here . ";Bran;Osha,Maester,Nan,Shaggydog,Rickon,Blood,Luwin,;0.0;15160;490
" Yes he is . I saw him . ";Maester;Osha,Bran,Nan,Shaggydog,Rickon,Blood,Luwin,;0.0;15161;490

" In your dream ... ? ";Bran;Osha,Maester,Nan,Shaggydog,Rickon,Blood,Luwin,;0.0;15163;490

Blood dripped down his arm where Shaggydog had shredded the wool of his sleeve and the flesh beneath . " Osha , the torch , " he said , biting through his pain , and she snatched it up before it went out .;Blood;Osha,Bran,Maester,Nan,Shaggydog,Rickon,Luwin,;-0.155555555556;15166;490
Soot stains blackened both legs of his uncle 's likeness . " That ... that beast , " Luwin went on , " is supposed to be chained up in the kennels . ";Luwin;Osha,Bran,Maester,Nan,Shaggydog,Rickon,Blood,;0.0;15167;490
Rickon patted Shaggydog 's muzzle , damp with blood . " I let him loose . He does n't like chains . ";Rickon;Osha,Bran,Maester,Nan,Shaggydog,Blood,Luwin,;-0.0769230769231;15168;490

" No . I like it here . ";Maester;Osha,Bran,Nan,Shaggydog,Rickon,Blood,Luwin,;0.0;15171;490

" Bran , " the maester said firmly , " I know you mean well , but Shaggydog is too wild to run loose . I 'm the third man he 's savaged . Give him the freedom of the castle and it 's only a question of time before he kills someone . The truth is hard , but the wolf has to be chained , or ... ";Maester;Shaggydog,;-0.0968482905983;15176;490

" That is quite impossible , " Maester Luwin said .;Maester;Osha,Bran,Nan,Shaggydog,Rickon,Blood,Luwin,;-0.666666666667;15180;490
Osha grinned . " The boy 's the lordling here , as I recall . ";Osha;Bran,Maester,Nan,Shaggydog,Rickon,Blood,Luwin,;0.0;15181;490
She handed Luwin back his torch and scooped Bran up into her arms again . " The maester 's tower it is . ";Bran;Osha,Maester,Nan,Shaggydog,Rickon,Blood,Luwin,;0.0;15182;490
" Will you come , Rickon ? ";Osha;Bran,Maester,Nan,Shaggydog,Rickon,Blood,Luwin,;0.0;15183;490
His brother nodded . " If Shaggy comes too , " he said , running after Osha and Bran , and there was nothing Maester Luwin could do but follow , keeping a wary eye on the wolves .;Maester;Osha,Bran,Nan,Shaggydog,Rickon,Blood,Luwin,;-0.5;15184;490
Their strident quorks drifted down from above as Osha washed and cleaned and bandaged the maester 's wounds , under Luwin 's terse instruction . " This is folly , " the small grey man said while she dabbed at the wolf bites with a stinging ointment . " I agree that it is odd that both you boys dreamed the same dream , yet when you stop to consider it , it 's only natural . You miss your lord father , and you know that he is a captive . Fear can fever a man 's mind and give him queer thoughts . Rickon is too young to comprehend - ";Osha;Rickon,;-0.0222222222222;15187;490
" I 'm four now , " Rickon said .;Rickon;Osha,Bran,Maester,Nan,Shaggydog,Blood,Luwin,;0.0;15188;490
" - too young , and-ooh , seven hells , that burns , no , do n't stop , more . Too young , as I say , but you , Bran , you 're old enough to know that dreams are only dreams . ";Bran;Osha,Maester,Nan,Shaggydog,Rickon,Blood,Luwin,;0.133333333333;15191;490
" Some are , some are n't . ";Maester;Osha,Bran,Nan,Shaggydog,Rickon,Blood,Luwin,;0.0;15192;490
Luwin gasped . " The children of the forest could tell you a thing or two about dreaming . ";Luwin;Osha,Bran,Maester,Nan,Shaggydog,Rickon,Blood,;0.0;15194;490
Tears were streaming down the maester 's face , yet he shook his head doggedly . " The children ... live only in dreams . Now . Dead and gone . Enough , that 's enough . Now the bandages .

" Old Nan says the children knew the songs of the trees , that they could fly like birds and swim like fish and talk to the animals , " Bran said . " She says that they made music so beautiful that it made you cry like a little baby just to hear it . ";Bran;Nan,;0.390625;15196;490
" And all this they did with magic , " Maester Luwin said , distracted . " I wish they were here now . A spell would heal my arm less painfully , and they could talk to Shaggy dog and tell him not to bite . ";Maester;Osha,Bran,Nan,Shaggydog,Rickon,Blood,Luwin,;0.166666666667;15197;490
He gave the big black wolf an angry glance out of the corner of his eye . " Take a lesson , Bran . The man who trusts in spells is dueling with a glass sword . As the children did . Here , let me show you something . ";Bran;Osha,Maester,Nan,Shaggydog,Rickon,Blood,Luwin,;-0.222222222222;15198;490
He stood abruptly , crossed the room , and returned with a green jar in his good hand . " Have a look at these , " he said as he pulled the stopper and shook out a handful of shiny black arrowheads .;Maester;Osha,Bran,Nan,Shaggydog,Rickon,Blood,Luwin,;0.0944444444444;15199;490
Bran picked one up . " It 's made of glass . ";Bran;Osha,Maester,Nan,Shaggydog,Rickon,Blood,Luwin,;0.0;15200;490

" Obsidian , " Maester Luwin insisted , holding out his wounded arm . " Forged in the fires of the gods , far below the earth . The children of the forest hunted with that , thousands of years ago . The children worked no metal . In place of mail , they wore long shirts of woven leaves and bound their legs in bark , so they seemed to melt into the wood . In place of swords , they carried blades of obsidian . ";Maester;Osha,Bran,Nan,Shaggydog,Rickon,Blood,Luwin,;0.025;15203;490
" And still do . ";Osha;Bran,Maester,Nan,Shaggydog,Rickon,Blood,Luwin,;0.0;15204;490
He thought it beautiful . " Can I keep one ? ";Bran;Osha,Maester,Nan,Shaggydog,Rickon,Blood,Luwin,;0.85;15208;490

" I want one too , " Rickon said . " I want four . I 'm four . ";Rickon;Osha,Bran,Maester,Nan,Shaggydog,Blood,Luwin,;0.0;15210;490
Luwin made him count them out . " Careful , they 're still sharp . Do n't cut yourself . ";Luwin;Osha,Bran,Maester,Nan,Shaggydog,Rickon,Blood,;-0.1125;15211;490
" Tell me about the children , " Bran said .;Bran;Osha,Maester,Nan,Shaggydog,Rickon,Blood,Luwin,;0.0;15212;490
" What do you wish to know ? ";Maester;Osha,Bran,Nan,Shaggydog,Rickon,Blood,Luwin,;0.0;15214;490
" Everything . ";Bran;Osha,Maester,Nan,Shaggydog,Rickon,Blood,Luwin,;0.0;15215;490
Maester Luwin tugged at his chain collar where it chafed against his neck . " They were people of the Dawn Age , the very first , before kings and kingdoms , " he said . " In those days , there were no castles or holdfasts , no cities , not so much as a market town to be found between here and the sea of Dorne . There were no men at all . Only the children of the forest dwelt in the lands we now call the Seven Kingdoms .;Maester;Osha,Bran,Nan,Shaggydog,Rickon,Blood,Luwin,;0.141666666667;15216;490
" They were a people dark and beautiful , small of stature , no taller than children even when grown to manhood . They lived in the depths of the wood , in caves and crannogs and secret tree towns . Slight as they were , the children were quick and graceful . Male and female hunted together , with weirwood bows and flying snares . Their gods were the gods of the forest , stream , and stone , the old gods whose names are secret . Their wise men were called greenseers , and carved strange faces in the weirwoods to keep watch on the woods . How long the children reigned here or where they came from , no man can know .;Bran;Osha,Maester,Nan,Shaggydog,Rickon,Blood,Luwin,;0.0397435897436;15217;490
" But some twelve thousand years ago , the First Men appeared from the east , crossing the Broken Arm of Dorne before it was broken . They came with bronze swords and great leathern shields , riding horses . No horse had ever been seen on this side of the narrow sea . No doubt the children were as frightened by the horses as the First Men were by the faces in the trees . As the First Men carved out holdfasts and farms , they cut down the faces and gave them to the fire . Horror-struck , the children went to war . The old songs say that the greenseers used dark magics to make the seas rise and sweep away the land , shattering the Arm , but it was too late to close the door . The wars went on until the earth ran red with blood of men and children both , but more children than men , for men were bigger and stronger , and wood and stone and obsidian make a poor match for bronze . Finally the wise of both races prevailed , and the chiefs and heroes of the First Men met the greenseers and wood dancers amidst the weirwood groves of a small island in the great lake called Gods Eye .;Maester;earth,Gods,;0.0865497076023;15218;490
" There they forged the Pact . The First Men were given the coastlands , the high plains and bright meadows , the mountains and bogs , but the deep woods were to remain forever the children ' s , and no more weirwoods were to be put to the axe anywhere in the realm . So the gods might bear witness to the signing , every tree on the island was given a face , and afterward , the sacred order of green men was formed to keep watch over the Isle of Faces .;Bran;Pact,;0.235;15219;490
" The Pact began four thousand years of friendship between men and children . In time , the First Men even put aside the gods they had brought with them , and took up the worship of the secret gods of the wood . The signing of the Pact ended the Dawn Age , and began the Age of Heroes . ";Maester;Pact,Age,;-0.075;15220;490
Bran 's fist curled around the shiny black arrowhead . " But the children of the forest are all gone now , you said . ";Bran;Osha,Maester,Nan,Shaggydog,Rickon,Blood,Luwin,;-0.166666666667;15221;490
" Here , they are , " said Osha , as she bit off the end of the last bandage with her teeth . " North of the Wall , things are different . That 's where the children went , and the giants , and the other old races . ";Osha;Bran,Maester,Nan,Shaggydog,Rickon,Blood,Luwin,;-0.00625;15222;490
Maester Luwin sighed . " Woman , by rights you ought to be dead or in chains . The Starks have treated you more gently than you deserve . It is unkind to repay them for their kindness by filling the boys ' heads with folly . ";Maester;Stark,;0.15;15223;490

" Me too , " Rickon echoed .;Rickon;Osha,Bran,Maester,Nan,Shaggydog,Blood,Luwin,;0.0;15225;490
" Oh , very well , " Luwin muttered . " So long as the kingdoms of the First Men held sway , the Pact endured , all through the Age of Heroes and the Long Night and the birth of the Seven Kingdoms , yet finally there came a time , many centuries later , when other peoples crossed the narrow sea .;Luwin;Pact,;0.065625;15226;490
" The Andals were the first , a race of tall , fair-haired warriors who came with steel and fire and the seven-pointed star of the new gods painted on their chests . The wars lasted hundreds of years , but in the end the six southron kingdoms all fell before them . Only here , where the King in the North threw back every army that tried to cross the Neck , did the rule of the First Men endure . The Andals burnt out the weirwood groves , hacked down the faces , slaughtered the children where they found them , and everywhere proclaimed the triumph of the Seven over the old gods . So the children fled north - ";Bran;Andals,North,Neck,;0.072601010101;15227;490
When Shaggydog bounded to his feet and added his voice to his brother ' s , dread clutched at Bran 's heart . " It 's coming , " he whispered , with the certainty of despair .;Shaggydog;Osha,Bran,Maester,Nan,Rickon,Blood,Luwin,;0.0;15230;490
There was dried blood on its wings . " A hawk , " Luwin murmured , " perhaps an owl . Poor thing , a wonder it got through . ";Luwin;Bran,Osha,Maester,;-0.3;15245;491
Bran found himself shivering as the maester unrolled the paper . " What is it ? ";Bran;Luwin,Osha,Maester,;0.0;15247;491
" You know what it is , boy , " Osha said , not unkindly .;Osha;Luwin,Bran,Maester,;0.0;15249;491
Maester Luwin looked up at them numbly , a small grey man with blood on the sleeve of his grey wool robe and tears in his bright grey eyes . " My lords , " he said to the sons , in a voice gone hoarse and shrunken , " we ... we shall need to find a stonecarver who knew his likeness well ... ";Maester;Luwin,Bran,Osha,;0.06;15251;491
She woke murmuring , " Please , please , I 'll be good , I 'll be good , please do n't , " but there was no one to hear .;Sansa;Joffrey,Clegane,King,Serrett,Hound,;0.65;15284;492
" You will attend me in court this afternoon , " Joffrey said . " See that you bathe and dress as befits my betrothed . ";Joffrey;Sansa,Clegane,King,Serrett,Hound,;0.0;15290;492
Sansa drew her blanket up to her chin to cover herself . " No , " she whimpered , " please ... leave me be . ";Sansa;Joffrey,Clegane,King,Serrett,Hound,;0.0;15293;492
" If you wo n't rise and dress yourself , my Hound will do it for you , " Joffrey said .;Joffrey;Hound,;0.0;15294;492

Sansa backed away from them . " I did as the queen asked , I wrote the letters , I wrote what she told me . You promised you'd be merciful . Please , let me go home .

Remembering her courtesies , she lowered her head . " As it please you , " she finished weakly .;King;Joffrey,Sansa,Clegane,Serrett,Hound,;0.0;15302;492
" It does not please me , " Joffrey said . " Mother says I 'm still to marry you , so you 'll stay here , and you 'll obey . ";Joffrey;Mother,;0.0;15303;492
" I do n't want to marry you , " Sansa wailed . " You chopped off my father 's head ! ";Sansa;Joffrey,Clegane,King,Serrett,Hound,;0.0;15304;492

His lips were as soft and red as the worms you found after a rain , and his eyes were vain and cruel . " I hate you , " she whispered .;Sansa;Joffrey,Clegane,King,Serrett,Hound,;-0.425;15309;492
King Joffrey 's face hardened . " My mother tells me that it is n't fitting that a king should strike his wife . Ser Meryn . ";King;Joffrey,Sansa,Clegane,Serrett,Hound,;0.5;15310;492
" Will you obey now , or shall I have him chastise you again ? ";Joffrey;Sansa,Clegane,King,Serrett,Hound,;0.0;15315;492

" Your Grace , " Joffrey corrected her . " I shall look for you in court . ";Joffrey;Sansa,Clegane,King,Serrett,Hound,;0.0;15318;492
Ser Meryn and Ser Arys followed him out , but Sandor Clegane lingered long enough to yank her roughly to her feet . " Save yourself some pain , girl , and give him what he wants . ";Serrett;Joffrey,Sansa,Clegane,King,Hound,;0.05;15320;492
" What ... what does he want ? Please , tell me . ";Joffrey;Sansa,Clegane,King,Serrett,Hound,;0.0;15321;492
" He wants you to smile and smell sweet and be his lady love , " the Hound rasped . " He wants to hear you recite all your pretty little words the way the septa taught you . He wants you to love him ... and fear him . ";Hound;Joffrey,Sansa,Clegane,King,Serrett,;0.256944444444;15322;492
After he was gone , Sansa sank back onto the rushes , staring at the wall until two of her bedmaids crept timidly into the chamber . " I will need hot water for my bath , please , " she told them , " and perfume , and some powder to hide this bruise . ";Sansa;Joffrey,Clegane,King,Serrett,Hound,;0.125;15323;492
His visor had been removed from his helm , to better show his dour face ; pouchy bags under his eyes , a wide sour mouth , rusty hair spotted with grey . " My lady , " he said , bowing , as if he had not beaten her bloody only three hours past . " His Grace has instructed me to escort you to the throne room . ";Serrett;Grace,;-0.116666666667;15335;493

" Yes ... but you are no true knight , Ser Meryn . ";Clegane;Serrett,Sansa,Hound,;0.35;15347;493
Two knights came to him with a dispute about some land , and he decreed that they should duel for it on the morrow . " To the death , " he added .;Lord;Joffrey,Hound,;0.0;15357;494
She had loved him , she said , and she wanted to see him decently buried . " If you loved a traitor , you must be a traitor too , " Joffrey said .;Joffrey;Lord,Hound,;0.7;15359;494
But a voice inside her whispered , There are no heroes , and she remembered what Lord Petyr had said to her , here in this very hall . " Life is not a song , sweetling , " he'd told her . " You may learn that one day to your sorrow . ";Lord;Life,;0.2;15363;494

Sansa could not look at him , he shamed her so . " Septa Mordane says most ... most highborn girls have their flowering at twelve or thirteen . ";Sansa;Mordane,;0.5;15394;495
Joffrey nodded . " This way . ";Joffrey;Sansa,Serrett,Clegane,;0.0;15395;495

Joffrey marched her down the wallwalk , past a dozen more heads and two empty spikes . " I 'm saving those for my uncle Stannis and my uncle Renly , " he explained .;Joffrey;Stannis,;-0.00138888888889;15430;496
The king pointed to one and said , " That 's your septa there , " but Sansa could not even have told that it was a woman .;Sansa;Joffrey,Lord,Mordane,Hound,;0.0;15433;496
Sansa had wondered what had happened to Septa Mordane , although she supposed she had known all along . " Why did you kill her ? ";Sansa;Joffrey,Lord,Mordane,Hound,;0.0;15435;496
she asked . " She was god-sworn ... ";Joffrey;Lord,Sansa,Mordane,Hound,;0.0;15436;496
" She was a traitor . ";Sansa;Joffrey,Lord,Mordane,Hound,;0.0;15437;496
Joffrey looked pouty ; somehow she was upsetting him . " You have n't said what you mean to give me for my name day . Maybe I should give you something instead , would you like that ? ";Joffrey;Lord,Sansa,Mordane,Hound,;-0.3125;15438;496
" If it please you , my lord , " Sansa said .;Sansa;Joffrey,Lord,Mordane,Hound,;0.0;15439;496
When he smiled , she knew he was mocking her . " Your brother is a traitor too , you know . ";Joffrey;Lord,Sansa,Mordane,Hound,;0.6;15440;496
He turned Septa Mordane 's head back around . " I remember your brother from Winterfell . My dog called him the lord of the wooden sword . Did n't you , dog ? ";Mordane;Joffrey,Lord,Sansa,Hound,;0.0;15441;496
" Did I ? ";Joffrey;Lord,Sansa,Mordane,Hound,;0.0;15442;496
the Hound replied . " I do n't recall . ";Hound;Joffrey,Lord,Sansa,Mordane,;0.0;15443;496
Joffrey gave a petulant shrug . " Your brother defeated my uncle Jaime . My mother says it was treachery and deceit . She wept when she heard . Women are all weak , even her , though she pretends she is n't . She says we need to stay in King 's Landing in case my other uncles attack , but I do n't care . After my name day feast , I 'm going to raise a host and kill your brother myself . That 's what I 'll give you , Lady Sansa . Your brother 's head . ";Joffrey;Women,Jaime,;-0.25;15444;496
A kind of madness took over her then , and she heard herself say , " Maybe my brother will give me your head . ";Sansa;Joffrey,Lord,Mordane,Hound,;0.6;15445;496
Joffrey scowled . " You must never mock me like that . A true wife does not mock her lord . Ser Meryn , teach her . ";Joffrey;Lord,Sansa,Mordane,Hound,;0.35;15446;496
" You should n't be crying all the time , " Joffrey told her . " You 're more pretty when you smile and laugh . ";Joffrey;Lord,Sansa,Mordane,Hound,;0.23;15450;496
Sansa made herself smile , afraid that he would have Ser Meryn hit her again if she did not , but it was no good , the king still shook his head . " Wipe off the blood , you 're all messy . ";Sansa;Joffrey,Lord,Mordane,Hound,;0.116666666667;15451;496

Drogo held her in strong arms , and his hand stroked her sex and opened her and woke that sweet wetness that was his alone , and the stars smiled down on them , stars in a daylight sky . " Home , " she whispered as he entered her and filled her with his seed , but suddenly the stars were gone , and across the blue sky swept the great wings , and the world took flame .;Drogo;Jorah,Viserys,Targaryen,Fire,Jhiqui,;0.346825396825;15478;498

Ser Jorah 's face was drawn and sorrowful . " Rhaegar was the last dragon , " he told her .;Jorah;Rhaegar,;0.0;15480;498

" Khaleesi ? ";Jhiqui;Drogo,Jorah,Viserys,Targaryen,Fire,;0.0;15519;498
But it was only a dream . " Help me , " she whispered , struggling to rise . " Bring me ... ";Drogo;Jorah,Viserys,Targaryen,Fire,Jhiqui,;0.0;15525;498
It was as if her body had been torn to pieces and remade from the scraps . " I want ... ";Fire;Drogo,Jorah,Viserys,Targaryen,Jhiqui,;0.0;15528;498
" Yes , Khaleesi . ";Jhiqui;Drogo,Jorah,Viserys,Targaryen,Fire,;0.0;15529;498
Over his shoulder she saw her three handmaids , Jhogo with his little wisp of mustache , and the flat broad face of Mirri Maz Duur . " I must , " she tried to tell them , " I have to ... ";Jhogo;Jorah,Dany,Mirri,;-0.05;15543;499

This time Dany did not attempt to rise . " Irri , " she called , " Jhiqui . Doreah . ";time;Irri,Jhiqui,Dany,;0.0;15557;500
They were there at once . " My throat is dry , " she said , " so dry , " and they brought her water .;Jhiqui;time,Irri,Dany,;-0.0666666666667;15558;500
Irri dampened a soft cloth and stroked her brow . " I have been sick , " Dany said .;Irri;time,Jhiqui,Dany,;-0.307142857143;15560;500
The Dothraki girl nodded . " How long ? ";Jhiqui;time,Irri,Dany,;-0.05;15561;500
The cloth was soothing , but Irri seemed so sad , it frightened her . " Long , " she whispered .;Irri;time,Jhiqui,Dany,;-0.275;15562;500
When Jhiqui returned with more water , Mirri Maz Duur came with her , eyes heavy from sleep . " Drink , " she said , lifting Dany 's head to the cup once more , but this time it was only wine .;Jhiqui;time,Irri,Dany,;0.2;15563;500
She could feel the heaviness in her limbs , as sleep crept in to fill her up once more . " Bring me ... ";Irri;time,Jhiqui,Dany,;0.5;15566;500
she murmured , her voice slurred and drowsy . " Bring ... I want to hold ... ";Jhiqui;time,Irri,Dany,;0.0;15567;500

Her maids came running at the sound of her voice . " Water , " she told them , " a flagon of water , cold as you can find it . And fruit , I think . Dates . ";Dany;Jhiqui,Irri,Doreah,;-0.1;15584;501
" As you say , Khaleesi . ";Jhiqui;Dany,Irri,Doreah,;0.0;15585;501
" I want Ser Jorah , " she said , standing .;Dany;Jorah,;0.0;15586;501
Jhiqui brought a sandsilk robe and draped it over her shoulders . " And a warm bath , and Mirri Maz Duur , and ... ";Jhiqui;Dany,Irri,Doreah,;0.6;15587;501
Memory came back to her all at once , and she faltered . " Khal Drogo , " she forced herself to say , watching their faces with dread . " Is he - ? ";Dany;Jhiqui,Irri,Doreah,;-0.15;15588;501
" The khal lives , " Irri answered quietly ...;Irri;Dany,Jhiqui,Doreah,;0.0;15589;501
She turned to Doreah . " Tell me . ";Doreah;Dany,Jhiqui,Irri,;0.0;15591;501
" I ... I shall bring Ser Jorah , " the Lysene girl said , bowing her head and fleeing the tent .;Dany;Jorah,;0.0;15592;501
Jhiqui would have run as well , but Dany caught her by the wrist and held her captive . " What is it ? I must know . Drogo ... and my child . ";Jhiqui;Dany,Irri,Doreah,;0.2;15593;501
Why had she not remembered the child until now ? " My son ... Rhaego ... where is he ? I want him . ";Doreah;Dany,Jhiqui,Irri,;0.0;15594;501
Her handmaid lowered her eyes . " The boy ... he did not live , Khaleesi . ";Dany;Jhiqui,Irri,Doreah,;0.136363636364;15595;501
It seemed to her that they felt as hot as the one she had slept with , which was passing strange . " Ser Jorah , come here , " she said .;Dany;Mirri,Jorah,;0.1;15609;502
She took his hand and placed it on the black egg with the scarlet swirls . " What do you feel ? ";Mirri;Dany,Jorah,;-0.166666666667;15610;502
" Shell , hard as rock . ";Dany;Mirri,Jorah,;-0.291666666667;15611;502
The knight was wary . " Scales . ";Mirri;Dany,Jorah,;-0.5;15612;502
" Heat ? ";Dany;Mirri,Jorah,;0.0;15613;502
" No . Cold stone . ";Mirri;Dany,Jorah,;-0.6;15614;502
He took his hand away . " Princess , are you well ? Should you be up , weak as you are ? ";Dany;Mirri,Jorah,;-0.375;15615;502
" Weak ? I am strong , Jorah . ";Mirri;Dany,Jorah,;0.0291666666667;15616;502
To please him , she reclined on a pile of cushions . " Tell me how my child died . ";Jorah;Dany,Mirri,;0.0;15617;502
" He never lived , my princess . The women say ... ";Dany;Mirri,Jorah,;0.0;15618;502

His eyes were haunted . " They say the child was ... ";Dany;Mirri,Jorah,;0.0;15622;502
" Monstrous , " Mirri Maz Duur finished for him .;Mirri;Dany,Jorah,;0.0;15626;502
The knight was a powerful man , yet Dany understood in that moment that the maegi was stronger , and crueler , and infinitely more dangerous . " Twisted . I drew him forth myself . He was scaled like a lizard , blind , with the stub of a tail and small leather wings like the wings of a bat . When I touched him , the flesh sloughed off the bone , and inside he was full of graveworms and the stink of corruption . He had been dead for years . ";Dany;Mirri,Jorah,;-0.1125;15627;502
If she looked back she was lost . " My son was alive and strong when Ser Jorah carried me into this tent , " she said . " I could feel him kicking , fighting to be born . ";Jorah;Jorah,;0.177777777778;15630;502
" That may be as it may be , " answered Mirri Maz Duur , " yet the creature that came forth from your womb was as I said . Death was in that tent , Khaleesi . ";Mirri;Dany,Jorah,;0.0;15631;502
" Only shadows , " Ser Jorah husked , but Dany could hear the doubt in his voice . " I saw , maegi . I saw you , alone , dancing with the shadows . ";Jorah;Dany,Mirri,;0.0;15632;502
" The grave casts long shadows , Iron Lord , " Mirri said . " Long and dark , and in the end no light can hold them back . ";Mirri;Dany,Jorah,;0.03;15633;502
He knew it too ; the grey face , the hollow eyes , the limp . " The shadows have touched you too , Ser Jorah , " she told him .;Jorah;Dany,Mirri,;-0.125;15636;502
Dany turned to the godswife . " You warned me that only death could pay for life . I thought you meant the horse . ";Dany;Mirri,Jorah,;0.0;15638;502
" No , " Mirri Maz Duur said . " That was a lie you told yourself . You knew the price . ";Mirri;Dany,Jorah,;0.0;15639;502
If I look back I am lost . " The price was paid , " Dany said . " The horse , my child , Quaro and Qotho , Haggo and Cohollo . The price was paid and paid and paid . ";Dany;Mirri,Jorah,;0.0;15642;502
She rose from her cushions . " Where is Khal Drogo ? Show him to me , godswife , maegi , bloodmage , whatever you are . Show me Khal Drogo . Show me what I bought with my son 's life . ";Mirri;Drogo,;0.6;15643;502
" As you command , Khaleesi , " the old woman said . " Come , I will take you to him . ";Dany;Mirri,Jorah,;0.1;15644;502

" The Dothraki follow only the strong , " Ser Jorah said . " I am sorry , my princess . There was no way to hold them . Ko Pono left first , naming himself Khal Pono , and many followed him .

If I look back I am lost . " It was a cruel fate , " Dany said , " yet not so cruel as Mago 's will be . I promise you that , by the old gods and the new , by the lamb god and the horse god and every god that lives . I swear it by the Mother of Mountains and the Womb of the World .

" This is not life , for one who was as Drogo was . His life was laughter , and meat roasting over a firepit , and a horse between his legs .

Dany gestured at Ser Jorah and the others . " Leave us . I would speak with this maegi alone . ";Dany;Jorah,Mirri,Mormont,;0.0;15685;504
Mormont and the Dothraki withdrew . " You knew , " Dany said when they were gone .;Mormont;Jorah,Dany,Mirri,;0.0;15686;504

" It was wrong of them to burn my temple , " the heavy , flat-nosed woman said placidly . " That angered the Great Shepherd . ";Jorah;Shepherd,;-0.1625;15688;504

The Lhazareen woman spat . " Three riders had taken me , not as a man takes a woman but from behind , as a dog takes a bitch . The fourth was in me when you rode past . How then did you save me ? I saw my god 's house burn , where I had healed good men beyond counting . My home they burned as well , and in the street I saw piles of heads . I saw the head of a baker who made my bread . I saw the head of a boy I had saved from deadeye fever , only three moons past . I heard children crying as the riders drove them off with their whips . Tell me again what you saved .

Mirri Maz Duur laughed cruelly . " Look to your khal and see what life is worth , when all the rest is gone . ";Mirri;Jorah,Dany,Mormont,;0.5;15696;504
Dany told herself that the stars would be enough . " Remember , Drogo , " she whispered . " Remember our first ride together , the day we wed .

And when the bleak dawn broke over an empty horizon , Dany knew that he was truly lost to her . " When the sun rises in the west and sets in the east , " she said sadly .

" How could this happen ? ";Tyrion;Harys,Clegane,Mountain,Kevan,Flement,Lord,Addam,Lefford,Lannister,;0.0;15753;507
Ser Harys Swyft moaned . " How ? Even after the Whispering Wood , you had Riverrun ringed in iron , surrounded by a great host ... what madness made Ser Jaime decide to split his men into three separate camps ? Surely he knew how vulnerable that would leave them ? ";Harys;Jaime,Riverrun,;0.15;15754;507
" I would have done the same , " his uncle responded , a good deal more calmly than Tyrion might have . " You have never seen Riverrun , Ser Harys , or you would know that Jaime had little choice in the matter . The castle is situated at the end of the point of land where the Tumblestone flows into the Red Fork of the Trident . The rivers form two sides of a triangle , and when danger threatens , the Tullys open their sluice gates upstream to create a wide moat on the third side , turning Riverrun into an island . The walls rise sheer from the water , and from their towers the defenders have a commanding view of the opposite shores for many leagues around . To cut off all the approaches , a besieger must needs place one camp north of the Tumblestone , one south of the Red Fork , and a third between the rivers , west of the moat . There is no other way , none . ";Tyrion;Jaime,Riverrun,;0.0883928571429;15757;507
" Ser Kevan speaks truly , my lords , " the courier said . " We'd built palisades of sharpened stakes around the camps , yet it was not enough , not with no warning and the rivers cutting us off from each other . They came down on the north camp first . No one was expecting an attack . Marq Piper had been raiding our supply trains , but he had no more than fifty men .

The man gave a weary nod . " The Blackfish led the van , cutting down our sentries and clearing away the palisades for the main assault . By the time our men knew what was happening , riders were pouring over the ditch banks and galloping through the camp with swords and torches in hand . I was sleeping in the west camp , between the rivers . When we heard the fighting and saw the tents being fired , Lord Brax led us to the rafts and we tried to pole across , but the current pushed us downstream and the Tullys started flinging rocks at us with the catapults on their walls .

I was n't there to see , but it 's said the beast killed four men and ripped apart a dozen horses .

The bird shrieked when Jon entered . " Put the food on the table , " the Old Bear said , glancing up . " I 'll have some beer . ";Jon;Pyp,Mormont,Old,Lord,;0.1;16140;516
" Doubtless you loved your father , " Mormont said when Jon brought him his horn . " The things we love destroy us every time , lad . Remember when I told you that ? ";Mormont;Jon,Pyp,Old,Lord,;0.6;16146;516
" I remember , " Jon said sullenly .;Jon;Pyp,Mormont,Old,Lord,;0.0;16147;516

The Old Bear snorted . " Do you think they chose me Lord Commander of the Night 's Watch because I 'm dumb as a stump , Snow ? Aemon told me you'd go . I told him you'd be back .

Mormont tried a plum , spit out the pit . " I ordered a watch kept over you . You were seen leaving .

" No . ";Old;Jon,Pyp,Mormont,Lord,;0.0;16159;516
" Pity , we could use a horse like that . ";Jon;Pyp,Mormont,Old,Lord,;0.0;16161;516

" Nor live , I hope , " Mormont said , cutting his ham with a dagger and feeding a bite to the bird . " You have not deserted-yet . Here you stand .

" I thought so . ";Jon;Pyp,Mormont,Old,Lord,;0.0;16168;516
Mormont peeled the shell off a boiled egg . " Your father is dead , lad . Do you think you can bring him back ? ";Mormont;Jon,Pyp,Old,Lord,;-0.1;16169;516
" No , " he answered , sullen .;Jon;Pyp,Mormont,Old,Lord,;0.0;16170;516
" Good , " Mormont said . " We 've seen the dead come back , you and me , and it 's not something I care to see again . ";Mormont;Jon,Pyp,Old,Lord,;0.15;16171;516
He ate the egg in two bites and flicked a bit of shell out from between his teeth . " Your brother is in the field with all the power of the north behind him . Any one of his lords bannermen commands more swords than you 'll find in all the Night 's Watch . Why do you imagine that they need your help ? Are you such a mighty warrior , or do you carry a grumkin in your pocket to magic up your sword ? ";Jon;Pyp,Mormont,Old,Lord,;0.2;16172;516
The Old Bear sighed . " You are not the only one touched by this war . Like as not , my sister is marching in your brother 's host , her and those daughters of hers , dressed in men 's mail . Maege is a hoary old snark , stubborn , short-tempered , and willful . Truth be told , I can hardly stand to be around the wretched woman , but that does not mean my love for her is any less than the love you bear your half sisters . ";Old;Mormont,;0.0692708333333;16176;516
Frowning , Mormont took his last egg and squeezed it in his fist until the shell crunched . " Or perhaps it does . Be that as it may , I'd still grieve if she were slain , yet you do n't see me running off . I said the words , just as you did . My place is here ... where is yours , boy ?

The words would not come . " I do n't know . ";Jon;Pyp,Mormont,Old,Lord,;0.0;16179;516
" I do , " said Lord Commander Mormont . " The cold winds are rising , Snow . Beyond the Wall , the shadows lengthen . Cotter Pyke writes of vast herds of elk , streaming south and east toward the sea , and mammoths as well . He says one of his men discovered huge , misshapen footprints not three leagues from Eastwatch . Rangers from the Shadow Tower have found whole villages abandoned , and at night Ser Denys says they see fires in the mountains , huge blazes that burn from dusk till dawn . Quorin Halfhand took a captive in the depths of the Gorge , and the man swears that Mance Rayder is massing all his people in some new , secret stronghold he 's found , to what end the gods only know .

The raven flapped its wings at him . " War , war , war , war , " it sang .;Jon;Pyp,Mormont,Old,Lord,;0.0;16188;516
" It 's not , " Mormont told him . " Gods save us , boy , you 're not blind and you 're not stupid . When dead men come hunting in the night , do you think it matters who sits the Iron Throne ? ";Mormont;Gods,;-0.5;16189;516

" Why ? Why ? Why ? ";Mormont;Jon,Pyp,Old,Lord,;0.0;16193;516
" All I know is that the blood of the First Men flows in the veins of the Starks . The First Men built the Wall , and it 's said they remember things otherwise forgotten .

He pointed his dagger at Jon 's chest . " By custom , the Lord Commander 's steward is his squire as well ... but I do not care to wake every dawn wondering if you 've run off again .

A blind rage filled her , a rage at all the world ; at her brother Edmure and her sister Lysa , at the Lannisters , at the maesters , at Ned and her father and the monstrous gods who would take them both away from her .

He had been such a bold little boy , always in trouble . " He tried to put his tongue in my mouth , " Catelyn had confessed to her sister afterward , when they were alone . " He did with me too , " Lysa had whispered , shy and breathless . " I liked it . ";Catelyn;;0.0491666666667;16349;520
" Mother , " Robb said when he saw her standing there . " We must call a council . There are things to be decided . ";Robb;Glover,;0.0;16356;521
" Your grandfather would like to see you , " she said . " Robb , he 's very sick . ";Robb;Glover,;-0.928571428571;16357;521
" Ser Edmure told me . I am sorry , Mother ... for Lord Hoster and for you . Yet first we must meet . We 've had word from the south . Renly Baratheon has claimed his brother 's crown . ";Robb;Edmure,Renly,;-0.125;16358;521
" Renly ? ";Robb;Glover,;0.0;16359;521
she said , shocked . " I had thought , surely it would be Lord Stannis ... ";Robb;Lord,;-0.7;16360;521
" So did we all , my lady , " Galbart Glover said .;Glover;Robb,;0.0;16361;521
" Renly is not the king , " Robb said .;Robb;Renly,;0.0;16391;522
" You cannot mean to hold to Joffrey , my lord , " Galbart Glover said . " He put your father to death . ";Glover;Robb,Marq,Mormont,stubbornly,Stevron,Greatjon,Catelyn,Lord,Brynden,;-0.3125;16394;522
" That makes him evil , " Robb replied . " I do not know that it makes Renly king . Joffrey is still Robert 's eldest trueborn son , so the throne is rightfully his by all the laws of the realm . Were he to die , and I mean to see that he does , he has a younger brother . Tommen is next in line after Joffrey . ";Robb;Joffrey,Tom,;-0.328125;16395;522
" Tommen is no less a Lannister , " Ser Marq Piper snapped .;Marq;Tom,;-0.166666666667;16396;522
" As you say , " said Robb , troubled . " Yet if neither one is king , still , how could it be Lord Renly ? He 's Robert 's younger brother . Bran ca n't be Lord of Winterfell before me , and Renly ca n't be king before Lord Stannis . ";Robb;Bran,Lord,;-0.25;16397;522
Lady Mormont agreed . " Lord Stannis has the better claim . ";Mormont;Lord,;0.5;16398;522
" Renly is crowned , " said Marq Piper . " Highgarden and Storm 's End support his claim , and the Dornishmen will not be laggardly . If Winterfell and Riverrun add their strength to his , he will have five of the seven great houses behind him . Six , if the Arryns bestir themselves ! Six against the Rock ! My lords , within the year , we will have all their heads on pikes , the queen and the boy king , Lord Tywin , the Imp , the Kingslayer , Ser Kevan , all of them ! That is what we shall win if we join with King Renly . What does Lord Stannis have against that , that we should cast it all aside ? ";Marq;Renly,Dornishman,Lord,;0.339583333333;16399;522
" The right , " said Robb stubbornly .;stubbornly;Robb,Glover,Marq,Mormont,Stevron,Greatjon,Catelyn,Lord,Brynden,;0.285714285714;16400;522
" So you mean us to declare for Stannis ? ";Catelyn;Robb,Glover,Marq,Mormont,stubbornly,Stevron,Greatjon,Lord,Brynden,;-0.3125;16402;522
" I do n't know , " said Robb . " I prayed to know what to do , but the gods did not answer . The Lannisters killed my father for a traitor , and we know that was a lie , but if Joffrey is the lawful king and we fight against him , we will be traitors . ";Robb;Lannister,Joffrey,;0.0;16404;522
" My lord father would urge caution , " aged Ser Stevron said , with the weaselly smile of a Frey . " Wait , let these two kings play their game of thrones . When they are done fighting , we can bend our knees to the victor , or oppose him , as we choose . With Renly arming , likely Lord Tywin would welcome a truce ... and the safe return of his son . Noble lords , allow me to go to him at Harrenhal and arrange good terms and ransoms ... ";Stevron;Tywin,Harrenhal,;0.29375;16405;522
A roar of outrage drowned out his voice . " Craven ! ";Robb;Glover,Marq,Mormont,stubbornly,Stevron,Greatjon,Catelyn,Lord,Brynden,;0.0;16406;522
the Greatjon thundered . " Begging for a truce will make us seem weak , " declared Lady Mormont . " Ransoms be damned , we must not give up the Kingslayer , " shouted Rickard Karstark .;Greatjon;Ransoms,;-0.375;16407;522
" Why not a peace ? ";Catelyn;Robb,Glover,Marq,Mormont,stubbornly,Stevron,Greatjon,Lord,Brynden,;0.0;16408;522
The lords looked at her , but it was Robb 's eyes she felt , his and his alone . " My lady , they murdered my lord father , your husband , " he said grimly .;Robb;Glover,Marq,Mormont,stubbornly,Stevron,Greatjon,Catelyn,Lord,Brynden,;0.0;16410;522
He unsheathed his longsword and laid it on the table before him , the bright steel on the rough wood . " This is the only peace I have for Lannisters . ";Lord;Robb,Glover,Marq,Mormont,stubbornly,Stevron,Greatjon,Catelyn,Brynden,;0.2;16411;522
Catelyn waited until they had quieted . " My lords , " she said then , " Lord Eddard was your liege , but I shared his bed and bore his children . Do you think I love him any less than you ? ";Catelyn;Lord,;0.166666666667;16413;522
Her voice almost broke with her grief , but Catelyn took a long breath and steadied herself . " Robb , if that sword could bring him back , I should never let you sheathe it until Ned stood at my side once more ... but he is gone , and a hundred Whispering Woods will not change that . Ned is gone , and Daryn Hornwood , and Lord Karstark 's valiant sons , and many other good men besides , and none of them will return to us . Must we have more deaths still ? ";Catelyn;Ned,Wood,;0.146875;16414;522
" You are a woman , my lady , " the Greatjon rumbled in his deep voice . " Women do not understand these things . ";Greatjon;Women,;0.0;16415;522
" You are the gentle sex , " said Lord Karstark , with the lines of grief fresh on his face . " A man has a need for vengeance . ";Lord;Robb,Glover,Marq,Mormont,stubbornly,Stevron,Greatjon,Catelyn,Brynden,;-0.1;16416;522
" Give me Cersei Lannister , Lord Karstark , and you would see how gentle a woman can be , " Catelyn replied . " Perhaps I do not understand tactics and strategy ... but I understand futility . We went to war when Lannister armies were ravaging the riverlands , and Ned was a prisoner , falsely accused of treason . We fought to defend ourselves , and to win my lord 's freedom .;Catelyn;Cersei,Ned,;0.5;16417;522
" Well , the one is done , and the other forever beyond our reach . I will mourn for Ned until the end of my days , but I must think of the living . I want my daughters back , and the queen holds them still . If I must trade our four Lannisters for their two Starks , I will call that a bargain and thank the gods . I want you safe , Robb , ruling at Winterfell from your father 's seat . I want you to live your life , to kiss a girl and wed a woman and father a son . I want to write an end to this . I want to go home , my lords , and weep for my husband . ";Robb;Lannister,;0.127840909091;16418;522
" Peace , " said her uncle Brynden . " Peace is sweet , my lady ... but on what terms ? It is no good hammering your sword into a plowshare if you must forge it again on the morrow . ";Brynden;Peace,;0.5;16420;522

" Aye , " said Lord Bracken . " Gregor Clegane laid waste to my fields , slaughtered my smallfolk , and left Stone Hedge a smoking ruin . Am I now to bend the knee to the ones who sent him ? What have we fought for , if we are to put all back as it was before ? ";Lord;Clegane,;-0.0666666666667;16423;522
Lord Blackwood agreed , to Catelyn 's surprise and dismay . " And if we do make peace with King Joffrey , are we not then traitors to King Renly ? What if the stag should prevail against the lion , where would that leave us ? ";Lord;Robb,Glover,Marq,Mormont,stubbornly,Stevron,Greatjon,Catelyn,Brynden,;0.0;16424;522
" Whatever you may decide for yourselves , I shall never call a Lannister my king , " declared Marq Piper .;Marq;Robb,Glover,Mormont,stubbornly,Stevron,Greatjon,Catelyn,Lord,Brynden,;0.0;16425;522
" Nor I ! ";Robb;Glover,Marq,Mormont,stubbornly,Stevron,Greatjon,Catelyn,Lord,Brynden,;0.0;16426;522

" MY LORDS ! ";Catelyn;Robb,Lord,Mormont,;0.0;16437;523
he shouted , his voice booming off the rafters . " Here is what I say to these two kings ! ";Lord;Catelyn,Robb,Mormont,;0.0;16438;523
He spat . " Renly Baratheon is nothing to me , nor Stannis neither . Why should they rule over me and mine , from some flowery seat in Highgarden or Dorne ? What do they know of the Wall or the wolfswood or the barrows of the First Men ? Even their gods are wrong . The Others take the Lannisters too , I 've had a bellyful of them . ";Mormont;Renly,Lannister,;-0.125;16439;523
He reached back over his shoulder and drew his immense two-handed greatsword . " Why should n't we rule ourselves again ? It was the dragons we married , and the dragons are all dead ! ";Lord;Catelyn,Robb,Mormont,;0.015625;16440;523
He pointed at Robb with the blade . " There sits the only king I mean to bow my knee to , m'lords , " he thundered . " The King in the North ! ";Robb;Catelyn,Lord,Mormont,;-0.1953125;16441;523
" I 'll have peace on those terms , " Lord Karstark said . " They can keep their red castle and their iron chair as well . ";Lord;Catelyn,Robb,Mormont,;0.0;16443;523
He eased his longsword from its scabbard . " The King in the North ! ";Catelyn;Robb,Lord,Mormont,;0.0;16444;523

Bound hand and foot , Mirri Maz Duur watched from the dust with disquiet in her black eyes . " It is not enough to kill a horse , " she told Dany . " By itself , the blood is nothing . You do not have the words to make a spell , nor the wisdom to find them . Do you think bloodmagic is a game for children ? You call me maegi as if it were a curse , but all it means is wise . You are a child , with a child 's ignorance . Whatever you mean to do , it will not work . Loose me from these bonds and I will help you . ";Mirri;Dany,Aggo,Jorah,;-0.0426816239316;16462;524
" I am tired of the maegi 's braying , " Dany told Jhogo .;Dany;Mirri,Aggo,Jorah,;-0.4;16463;524
Aggo would have added the weapons Drogo 's bloodriders had given Dany for bride gifts as well , but she forbade it . " Those are mine , " she told him , " and I mean to keep them . ";Aggo;Mirri,Dany,Jorah,;-0.3125;16468;524
Ser Jorah Mormont drew her aside as the sun was creeping toward its zenith . " Princess ... ";Jorah;Mirri,Dany,Aggo,;0.0;16470;524
" Why do you call me that ? ";Mirri;Dany,Aggo,Jorah,;0.0;16472;524
Dany challenged him . " My brother Viserys was your king , was he not ? ";Dany;Viserys,;0.0;16473;524
" He was , my lady . ";Jorah;Mirri,Dany,Aggo,;0.0;16474;524
" Viserys is dead . I am his heir , the last blood of House Targaryen . Whatever was his is mine now . ";Dany;Viserys,;-0.1;16475;524
" My ... queen , " Ser Jorah said , going to one knee . " My sword that was his is yours , Daenerys . And my heart as well , that never belonged to your brother . I am only a knight , and I have nothing to offer you but exile , but I beg you , hear me . Let Khal Drogo go . You shall not be alone . I promise you , no man shall take you to Vaes Dothrak unless you wish to go . You need not join the dosh khaleen . Come east with me . Yi Ti , Qarth , the Jade Sea , Asshai by the Shadow . We will see all the wonders yet unseen , and drink what wines the gods see fit to serve us . Please , Khaleesi . I know what you intend . Do not . Do not . ";Jorah;Drogo,;0.2;16476;524
" I must , " Dany told him .;Dany;Mirri,Aggo,Jorah,;0.0;16477;524
She touched his face , fondly , sadly . " You do not understand . ";Mirri;Dany,Aggo,Jorah,;0.0;16478;524
" I understand that you loved him , " Ser Jorah said in a voice thick with despair . " I loved my lady wife once , yet I did not die with her . You are my queen , my sword is yours , but do not ask me to stand aside as you climb on Drogo 's pyre . I will not watch you burn . ";Jorah;Mirri,Dany,Aggo,;0.366666666667;16479;524
" Is that what you fear ? ";Mirri;Dany,Aggo,Jorah,;0.0;16480;524
Dany kissed him lightly on his broad forehead . " I am not such a child as that , sweet ser . ";Dany;Mirri,Aggo,Jorah,;0.1375;16481;524
" You do not mean to die with him ? You swear it , my queen ? ";Jorah;Mirri,Dany,Aggo,;-0.3125;16482;524
" I swear it , " she said in the Common Tongue of the Seven Kingdoms that by rights were hers .;Dany;Mirri,Aggo,Jorah,;-0.3;16483;524
" You will be my khalasar , " she told them . " I see the faces of slaves . I free you . Take off your collars . Go if you wish , no one shall harm you . If you stay , it will be as brothers and sisters , husbands and wives . ";Aegon;Jhogo,Dany,Aggo,Rakharo,Jorah,;0.4;16492;525
The black eyes watched her , wary , expressionless . " I see the children , women , the wrinkled faces of the aged . I was a child yesterday . Today I am a woman . Tomorrow I will be old . To each of you I say , give me your hands and your hearts , and there will always be a place for you . ";Dany;Aegon,Jhogo,Aggo,Rakharo,Jorah,;-0.166666666667;16493;525
She turned to the three young warriors of her khas . " Jhogo , to you I give the silver-handled whip that was my bride gift , and name you ko , and ask your oath , that you will live and die as blood of my blood , riding at my side to keep me safe from harm . ";Jorah;Aegon,Jhogo,Dany,Aggo,Rakharo,;0.245454545455;16494;525
Jhogo took the whip from her hands , but his face was confused . " Khaleesi , " he said hesitantly , " this is not done . It would shame me , to be bloodrider to a woman . ";Jhogo;Aegon,Dany,Aggo,Rakharo,Jorah,;-0.4;16495;525
" Aggo , " Dany called , paying no heed to Jhogo 's words .;Dany;Aegon,Jhogo,Aggo,Rakharo,Jorah,;0.0;16496;525
If I look back I am lost . " To you I give the dragonbone bow that was my bride gift . ";Jorah;Aegon,Jhogo,Dany,Aggo,Rakharo,;0.0;16497;525
It was double-curved , shiny black and exquisite , taller than she was . " I name you ko , and ask your oath , that you should live and die as blood of my blood , riding at my side to keep me safe from harm . ";Dany;Aegon,Jhogo,Aggo,Rakharo,Jorah,;0.367424242424;16498;525
Aggo accepted the bow with lowered eyes . " I cannot say these words . Only a man can lead a khalasar or name a ko . ";Aggo;Aegon,Jhogo,Dany,Rakharo,Jorah,;0.0;16499;525
" Rakharo , " Dany said , turning away from the refusal , " you shall have the great arakh that was my bride gift , with hilt and blade chased in gold . And you too I name my ko , and ask that you live and die as blood of my blood , riding at my side to keep me safe from harm . ";Dany;Aegon,Jhogo,Aggo,Rakharo,Jorah,;0.478787878788;16500;525
" You are khaleesi , " Rakharo said , taking the arakh . " I shall ride at your side to Vaes Dothrak beneath the Mother of Mountains , and keep you safe from harm until you take your place with the crones of the dosh khaleen . No more can I promise . ";Rakharo;Aegon,Jhogo,Dany,Aggo,Jorah,;0.5;16501;525
She nodded , as calmly as if she had not heard his answer , and turned to the last of her champions . " Ser Jorah Mormont , " she said , " first and greatest of my knights , I have no bride gift to give you , but I swear to you , one day you shall have from my hands a longsword like none the world has ever seen , dragon-forged and made of Valyrian steel . And I would ask for your oath as well . ";Dany;Aegon,Jhogo,Aggo,Rakharo,Jorah,;0.416666666667;16502;525
" You have it , my queen , " Ser Jorah said , kneeling to lay his sword at her feet . " I vow to serve you , to obey you , to die for you if need be . ";Jorah;Aegon,Jhogo,Dany,Aggo,Rakharo,;0.0;16503;525
" Whatever may come ? ";Dany;Aegon,Jhogo,Aggo,Rakharo,Jorah,;0.0;16504;525
" Whatever may come . ";Jorah;Aegon,Jhogo,Dany,Aggo,Rakharo,;0.0;16505;525
" I shall hold you to that oath . I pray you never regret the giving of it . ";Dany;Aegon,Jhogo,Aggo,Rakharo,Jorah,;0.0;16506;525
Stretching on her toes to reach his lips , she kissed the knight gently and said , " You are the first of my Queensguard . ";Jorah;Aegon,Jhogo,Dany,Aggo,Rakharo,;0.25;16508;525
" Oil , " she commanded , and they brought forth the jars and poured them over the pyre , soaking the silks and the brush and the bundles of dry grass , until the oil trickled from beneath the logs and the air was rich with fragrance . " Bring my eggs , " Dany commanded her handmaids .;Dany;Jorah,Mirri,;0.154166666667;16550;526
Ser Jorah took her arm . " My queen , Drogo will have no use for dragon 's eggs in the night lands . Better to sell them in Asshai . Sell one and we can buy a ship to take us back to the Free Cities . Sell all three and you will be a wealthy woman all your days . ";Jorah;Drogo,Asshai,;0.35;16552;526
" They were not given to me to sell , " Dany told him .;Dany;Jorah,Mirri,;0.0;16553;526
As she climbed down off the pyre , she noticed Mirri Maz Duur watching her . " You are mad , " the godswife said hoarsely .;Mirri;Dany,Jorah,;-0.390277777778;16559;526
" Is it so far from madness to wisdom ? ";Jorah;Dany,Mirri,;0.1;16560;526
Dany asked . " Ser Jorah , take this maegi and bind her to the pyre . ";Dany;Jorah,Mirri,;0.0;16561;526
" To the ... my queen , no , hear me ... ";Mirri;Dany,Jorah,;0.0;16562;526
" Do as I say . ";Dany;Jorah,Mirri,;0.0;16563;526
Still he hesitated , until her anger flared . " You swore to obey me , whatever might come . Rakharo , help him . ";Mirri;Dany,Jorah,;-0.7;16564;526
Dany poured the oil over the woman 's head herself . " I thank you , Mirri Maz Duur , " she said , " for the lessons you have taught me . ";Dany;Jorah,Mirri,;0.0;16566;526
" You will not hear me scream , " Mirri responded as the oil dripped from her hair and soaked her clothing .;Mirri;Dany,Jorah,;0.0;16567;526
" I will , " Dany said , " but it is not your screams I want , only your life . I remember what you told me . Only death can pay for life . ";Dany;Jorah,Mirri,;0.0;16568;526
Jhogo spied it first . " There , " he said in a hushed voice .;Jhogo;;0.25;16575;527
Jhogo was the first to lay his arakh at her feet . " Blood of my blood , " he murmured , pushing his face to the smoking earth . " Blood of my blood , " she heard Aggo echo . " Blood of my blood , " Rakharo shouted .;Jhogo;;0.25;16644;528
