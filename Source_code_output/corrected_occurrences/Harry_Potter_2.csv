" This could well be the day I make the biggest deal of my career , " said Uncle Vernon .;Uncle;Aunt,Dudley,Harry,tonelessly,Vernon,Petunia;0.0;59;1

" Harry Potter ! ";Dobby;Harry,voice,earnestly,politely,Uncle,Mason;0.0;177;4
said the creature in a high-pitched voice Harry was sure would carry down the stairs . " So long has Dobby wanted to meet you , sir...Such an honor it is ... ";voice;Dobby;0.0981481481481;178;4
" Th-thank you , " said Harry , edging along the wall and sinking into his desk chair , next to Hedwig , who was asleep in her large cage .;Harry;voice,earnestly,politely,Dobby,Uncle,Mason;0.107142857143;179;4
He wanted to ask , " What are you ? ";Dobby;Harry,voice,earnestly,politely,Uncle,Mason;0.0;180;4
but thought it would sound too rude , so instead he said , " Who are you ? ";Harry;voice,earnestly,politely,Dobby,Uncle,Mason;0.05;181;4
" Dobby , sir . Just Dobby . Dobby the house-elf , " said the creature .;Dobby;Harry,voice,earnestly,politely,Uncle,Mason;0.0;182;4
" Oh - really ? ";Uncle;Harry,voice,earnestly,politely,Dobby,Mason;0.0;183;4

" Not that I 'm not pleased to meet you , " said Harry quickly , " but , er , is there any particular reason you 're here ? ";Harry;voice,earnestly,politely,Dobby,Uncle,Mason;0.333333333333;187;4
" Oh , yes , sir , " said Dobby earnestly . " Dobby has come to tell you , sir...it is difficult , sir...Dobby wonders where to begin ... ";earnestly;Dobby;-0.5;188;4
" Sit down , " said Harry politely , pointing at the bed .;politely;Harry,voice,earnestly,Dobby,Uncle,Mason;-0.155555555556;189;4
" S-sit down ! ";Dobby;Harry,voice,earnestly,politely,Uncle,Mason;-0.194444444444;191;4
he wailed . " Never ...never ever ... ";Harry;voice,earnestly,politely,Dobby,Uncle,Mason;0.0;192;4
" I 'm sorry , " he whispered , " I did n't mean to offend you or anything - ";Dobby;Harry,voice,earnestly,politely,Uncle,Mason;-0.40625;194;4
" Offend Dobby ! ";Harry;Dobby;0.0;195;4
choked the elf . " Dobby has never been asked to sit down by a wizard - like an equal - ";Dobby;Dobby;-0.0777777777778;196;4
Harry , trying to say " Shh ! ";Harry;voice,earnestly,politely,Dobby,Uncle,Mason;0.0;197;4
" You ca n't have met many decent wizards , " said Harry , trying to cheer him up .;Harry;voice,earnestly,politely,Dobby,Uncle,Mason;0.333333333333;200;4
Then , without warning , he leapt up and started banging his head furiously on the window , shouting , " Bad Dobby ! Bad Dobby ! ";Dobby;Harry,voice,earnestly,politely,Uncle,Mason;-0.8671875;202;4
" Do n't - what are you doing ? ";Harry;voice,earnestly,politely,Dobby,Uncle,Mason;0.0;203;4
" Dobby had to punish himself , sir , " said the elf , who had gone slightly cross-eyed . " Dobby almost spoke ill of his family , sir ... ";Dobby;Dobby;-0.5;205;4
" Your family ? ";Harry;voice,earnestly,politely,Dobby,Uncle,Mason;0.0;206;4
" The wizard family Dobby serves , sir....Dobby is a house-elf - bound to serve one house and one family forever ... ";Dobby;family;0.0;207;4
" Do they know you 're here ? ";Harry;voice,earnestly,politely,Dobby,Uncle,Mason;0.0;208;4
" Oh , no , sir , no...Dobby will have to punish himself most grievously for coming to see you , sir . Dobby will have to shut his ears in the oven door for this . If they ever knew , sir - ";Dobby;Dobby;0.5;211;4
" But wo n't they notice if you shut your ears in the oven door ? ";Harry;voice,earnestly,politely,Dobby,Uncle,Mason;0.0;212;4
" Dobby doubts it , sir . Dobby is always having to punish himself for something , sir . They lets Dobby get on with it , sir . Sometimes they reminds me to do extra punishments ... ";Dobby;Dobby;0.0;213;4
" But why do n't you leave ? Escape ? ";Uncle;Harry,voice,earnestly,politely,Dobby,Mason;0.0;214;4
" A house-elf must be set free , sir . And the family will never set Dobby free...Dobby will serve the family until he dies , sir ... ";Harry;Dobby;0.4;215;4
" And I thought I had it bad staying here for another four weeks , " he said . " This makes the Dursleys sound almost human . Ca n't anyone help you ? Ca n't I ? ";Dobby;Harry,voice,earnestly,politely,Uncle,Mason;-0.0722222222222;217;4
" Please , " Harry whispered frantically , " please be quiet . If the Dursleys hear anything , if they know you 're here - ";Harry;voice,earnestly,politely,Dobby,Uncle,Mason;0.0;220;4
" Harry Potter asks if he can help Dobby...Dobby has heard of your greatness , sir , but of your goodness , Dobby never knew ... ";Dobby;Harry,Dobby;0.0;221;4
Harry , who was feeling distinctly hot in the face , said , " Whatever you 've heard about my greatness is a load of rubbish . I 'm not even top of my year at Hogwarts  ,  that 's Hermione , she - ";Harry;Hermione;0.375;222;4
" Harry Potter is humble and modest , " said Dobby reverently , his orb-like eyes aglow . " Harry Potter speaks not of his triumph over He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named - ";Dobby;Harry;-0.0333333333333;224;4
" Voldemort ? ";Harry;voice,earnestly,politely,Dobby,Uncle,Mason;0.0;225;4
Dobby clapped his hands over his bat ears and moaned , " Ah , speak not the name , sir ! Speak not the name ! ";Dobby;Harry,voice,earnestly,politely,Uncle,Mason;0.0;227;4
" Sorry , " said Harry quickly . " I know lots of people do n't like it . My friend Ron - ";Harry;voice,earnestly,politely,Dobby,Uncle,Mason;-0.5;228;4
" Dobby heard tell , " he said hoarsely , " that Harry Potter met the Dark Lord for a second time just weeks ago...that Harry Potter escaped yet again . ";Dobby;Dobby,Harry;-0.075;232;4
" Ah , sir , " he gasped , dabbing his face with a corner of the grubby pillowcase he was wearing . " Harry Potter is valiant and bold ! He has braved so many dangers already ! But Dobby has come to protect Harry Potter , to warn him , even if he does have to shut his ears in the oven door later....Harry Potter must not go back to Hogwarts . ";Harry;Harry,Dobby,Potter;0.381944444444;234;4
" W-what ? ";Dobby;Harry,voice,earnestly,politely,Uncle,Mason;0.0;236;4
Harry stammered . " But I 've got to go back - term starts on September first . It 's all that 's keeping me going . You do n't know what it 's like here . I do n't belong here . I belong in your world - at Hogwarts . ";Harry;voice,earnestly,politely,Dobby,Uncle,Mason;0.125;237;4
" No , no , no , " squeaked Dobby , shaking his head so hard his ears flapped . " Harry Potter must stay where he is safe . He is too great , too good , to lose . If Harry Potter goes back to Hogwarts , he will be in mortal danger . ";Dobby;Harry;0.331666666667;238;4
" Why ? ";Harry;voice,earnestly,politely,Dobby,Uncle,Mason;0.0;239;4
" There is a plot , Harry Potter . A plot to make most terrible things happen at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry this year , " whispered Dobby , suddenly trembling all over . " Dobby has known it for months , sir . Harry Potter must not put himself in peril . He is too important , sir ! ";Dobby;Dobby,Harry;-0.0416666666667;241;4
" What terrible things ? ";Uncle;Harry,voice,earnestly,politely,Dobby,Mason;-1.0;242;4
said Harry at once . " Who 's plotting them ? ";Harry;voice,earnestly,politely,Dobby,Uncle,Mason;0.0;243;4
" All right ! ";Dobby;Harry,voice,earnestly,politely,Uncle,Mason;0.357142857143;245;4
cried Harry , grabbing the elf 's arm to stop him . " You ca n't tell me . I understand . But why are you warning me ? ";Harry;voice,earnestly,politely,Dobby,Uncle,Mason;0.0;246;4
A sudden , unpleasant thought struck him . " Hang on - this has n't got anything to do with Vol - - sorry - with You-Know-Who , has it ? You could just shake or nod , " he added hastily as Dobby 's head tilted worryingly close to the wall again .;Dobby;Harry,voice,earnestly,politely,Uncle,Mason;-0.383333333333;247;4
" Not - not He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named , sir - ";Harry;voice,earnestly,politely,Dobby,Uncle,Mason;0.0;249;4
" He has n't got a brother , has he ? ";Dobby;Harry,voice,earnestly,politely,Uncle,Mason;0.0;252;4
" Well then , I ca n't think who else would have a chance of making horrible things happen at Hogwarts , " said Harry . " I mean , there 's Dumbledore , for one thing - you know who Dumbledore is , do n't you ? ";Harry;Dumbledore;-0.65625;254;4
" Albus Dumbledore is the greatest headmaster Hogwarts has ever had . Dobby knows it , sir . Dobby has heard Dumbledore 's powers rival those of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named at the height of his strength . But , sir " - Dobby 's voice dropped to an urgent whisper - " there are powers Dumbledore does n't...powers no decent wizard ... ";Dobby;Dumbledore,Dobby,headmaster,Power;0.583333333333;256;4
Two seconds later Harry , heart thudding madly , heard Uncle Vernon coming into the hall , calling , " Dudley must have left his television on again , the little tyke ! ";Uncle;Dudley;-0.078125;259;4
" Quick ! In the closet ! ";Harry;voice,earnestly,politely,Dobby,Uncle,Mason;0.520833333333;260;4
" What - the - devil - are - you - doing ? ";Dobby;Harry,voice,earnestly,politely,Uncle,Mason;0.0;262;4
said Uncle Vernon through gritted teeth , his face horribly close to Harry ' s. " You 've just ruined the punch line of my Japanese golfer joke....One more sound and you 'll wish you'd never been born , boy ! ";Uncle;Harry,voice,earnestly,politely,Dobby,Mason;0.375;263;4
" See what it 's like here ? ";Harry;voice,earnestly,politely,Dobby,Uncle,Mason;0.0;266;4
he said . " See why I 've got to go back to Hogwarts ? It 's the only place I 've got - well , I think I 've got friends . ";Dobby;Harry,voice,earnestly,politely,Uncle,Mason;0.0;267;4
" Friends who do n't even write to Harry Potter ? ";Uncle;Harry,voice,earnestly,politely,Dobby,Mason;0.0;268;4
" I expect they 've just been - wait a minute , " said Harry , frowning . " How do you know my friends have n't been writing to me ? ";Harry;voice,earnestly,politely,Dobby,Uncle,Mason;0.0;270;4
" Harry Potter must n't be angry with Dobby . Dobby did it for the best - ";Dobby;Harry;0.25;272;4
" Have you been stopping my letters ? ";Uncle;Harry,voice,earnestly,politely,Dobby,Mason;0.0;273;4
" Dobby has them here , sir , " said the elf .;Harry;Dobby;0.0;274;4
" Harry Potter must n't be angry....Dobby hoped...if Harry Potter thought his friends had forgotten him...Harry Potter might not want to go back to school , sir ... ";Dobby;Harry,Potter;0.0;278;4
" Harry Potter will have them , sir , if he gives Dobby his word that he will not return to Hogwarts . Ah , sir , this is a danger you must not face ! Say you wo n't go back , sir ! ";Uncle;Harry;0.0;281;4
" No , " said Harry angrily . " Give me my friends ' letters ! ";Harry;voice,earnestly,politely,Dobby,Uncle,Mason;0.0;282;4
" Then Harry Potter leaves Dobby no choice , " said the elf sadly .;Dobby;Harry;0.0;283;4
From the dining room he heard Uncle Vernon saying , " ...tell Petunia that very funny story about those American plumbers , Mr. Mason . She 's been dying to hear ... ";Uncle;Harry,voice,earnestly,politely,Dobby,Mason;0.1625;287;4
" No , " croaked Harry . " Please...they 'll kill me ... ";Harry;Please...they;0.0;291;4

" I ca n't - ";Dobby;Harry,voice,earnestly,politely,Uncle,Mason;0.0;295;4
" Then Dobby must do it , sir , for Harry Potter 's own good . ";Harry;Dobby;0.625;297;4
( " Just our nephew - very disturbed - meeting strangers upsets him , so we kept him upstairs ... " );Mason;Harry,voice,earnestly,politely,Dobby,Uncle;0.2;303;4
" Read it ! ";Dobby;Harry,voice,earnestly,politely,Uncle,Mason;0.0;311;4
he hissed evilly , brandishing the letter the owl had delivered . " Go on - read it ! ";Harry;voice,earnestly,politely,Dobby,Uncle,Mason;0.0;312;4
" You did n't tell us you were n't allowed to use magic outside school , " said Uncle Vernon , a mad gleam dancing in his eyes . " Forgot to mention it....Slipped your mind , I daresay ... ";Uncle;Harry;-0.0416666666667;329;5
He was bearing down on Harry like a great bulldog , all his teeth bared . " Well , I 've got news for you , boy....I 'm locking you up....You 're never going back to that school...never...and if you try and magic yourself out - they 'll expel you ! ";Harry;Uncle;0.367361111111;330;5
" It 's no good turning your beak up at it - that 's all we 've got , " said Harry grimly .;grimly;;0.65;349;6
He saw Dobby 's face in the crowd and shouted out , asking for help , but Dobby called , " Harry Potter is safe there , sir ! ";Dobby;Harry;0.625;358;7
" Stop it , " Harry muttered as the rattling pounded in his sore head . " Leave me alone...cut it out...I 'm trying to sleep ... ";Harry;Dobby;0.0;361;7
" Ron . ";Ron;Harry,Fred,George,Uncle,Weasley;0.0;371;8

" All right , Harry ? ";Ron;Harry,Fred,George,Uncle,Weasley;0.285714285714;376;8
" What 's been going on ? ";Fred;Harry,Ron,George,Uncle,Weasley;0.0;378;8
said Ron . " Why have n't you been answering my letters ? I 've asked you to stay about twelve times , and then Dad came home and said you'd got an official warning for using magic in front of Muggles - ";Ron;Dad;0.5;379;8
" It was n't me - and how did he know ? ";Fred;Harry,Ron,George,Uncle,Weasley;0.0;380;8
" He works for the Ministry , " said Ron . " You know we 're not supposed to do spells outside school - ";Ron;Harry,Fred,George,Uncle,Weasley;0.0;381;8
" You should talk , " said Harry , staring at the floating car .;Harry;Ron,Fred,George,Uncle,Weasley;0.0;382;8
" Oh , this does n't count , " said Ron . " We 're only borrowing this . It 's Dad ' s , we did n't enchant it . But doing magic in front of those Muggles you live with - ";Ron;Dad;0.212121212121;383;8
" I told you , I did n't - but it 'll take too long to explain now - look , can you tell them at Hogwarts that the Dursleys have locked me up and wo n't let me come back , and obviously I ca n't magic myself out , because the Ministry 'll think that 's the second spell I 've done in three days , so - ";Fred;Dursleys,Ministry,Hogwarts;0.1125;384;8

" Tie that around the bars , " said Fred , throwing the end of a rope to Harry .;Fred;Harry,Ron,George,Uncle,Weasley;0.0;388;8
" If the Dursleys wake up , I 'm dead , " said Harry as he tied the rope tightly around a bar and Fred revved up the car .;Fred;Harry,Ron,George,Uncle,Weasley;-0.2;389;8
" Do n't worry , " said Fred , " and stand back . ";Fred;Harry,Ron,George,Uncle,Weasley;0.0;390;8
" Get in , " Ron said .;Ron;Harry,Fred,George,Uncle,Weasley;0.0;397;8
" But all my Hogwarts stuff - my wand - my broomstick - ";Fred;Harry,Ron,George,Uncle,Weasley;0.0;398;8
" Where is it ? ";Ron;Harry,Fred,George,Uncle,Weasley;0.0;399;8
" Locked in the cupboard under the stairs , and I ca n't get out of this room - ";Fred;Harry,Ron,George,Uncle,Weasley;0.0;400;8
" No problem , " said George from the front passenger seat . " Out of the way , Harry . ";George;Harry,Ron,Fred,Uncle,Weasley;0.0;401;8
" A lot of wizards think it 's a waste of time , knowing this sort of Muggle trick , " said Fred , " but we feel they 're skills worth learning , even if they are a bit slow . ";Fred;Harry,Ron,George,Uncle,Weasley;-0.0666666666667;404;8
" So - we 'll get your trunk - you grab anything you need from your room and hand it out to Ron , " whispered George .;George;Harry,Ron,Fred,Uncle,Weasley;0.0;406;8
" Watch out for the bottom stair - it creaks , " Harry whispered back as the twins disappeared onto the dark landing .;Harry;Ron,Fred,George,Uncle,Weasley;-0.075;407;8
" A bit more , " panted Fred , who was pulling from inside the car . " One good push - ";Fred;Harry,Ron,George,Uncle,Weasley;0.575;415;8
" Okay , let 's go , " George whispered .;George;Harry,Ron,Fred,Uncle,Weasley;0.5;417;8
" THAT RUDDY OWL ! ";Fred;Harry,Ron,George,Uncle,Weasley;0.0;419;8
" I 've forgotten Hedwig ! ";Ron;Hedwig;0.0;420;8
" Petunia ! ";Fred;Harry,Ron,George,Uncle,Weasley;0.0;425;8
roared Uncle Vernon . " He 's getting away ! HE'S GETTING AWAY ! ";Uncle;Harry,Ron,Fred,George,Weasley;0.0;426;8
" Put your foot down , Fred ! ";Ron;Harry,Fred,George,Uncle,Weasley;-0.194444444444;428;8
" See you next summer ! ";Fred;Harry,Ron,George,Uncle,Weasley;0.0;433;8
" Let Hedwig out , " he told Ron . " She can fly behind us . She has n't had a chance to stretch her wings for ages . ";Ron;Hedwig;0.2;436;8
" So - what 's the story , Harry ? ";Fred;Harry,Ron,George,Uncle,Weasley;0.0;438;8
said Ron impatiently . " What 's been happening ? ";Ron;Harry,Fred,George,Uncle,Weasley;0.0;439;8
" Very fishy , " said Fred finally .;Fred;Harry,Ron,George,Uncle,Weasley;0.2;442;8
" Definitely dodgy " agreed George . " So he would n't even tell you who 's supposed to be plotting all this stuff ? ";George;Harry,Ron,Fred,Uncle,Weasley;0.0;443;8
" I do n't think he could , " said Harry . " I told you , every time he got close to letting something slip , he started banging his head against the wall . ";Harry;Ron,Fred,George,Uncle,Weasley;0.0;444;8
" What , you think he was lying to me ? ";Ron;Harry,Fred,George,Uncle,Weasley;0.0;446;8
" Well , " said Fred , " put it this way - house-elves have got powerful magic of their own , but they ca n't usually use it without their master 's permission . I reckon old Dobby was sent to stop you coming back to Hogwarts . Someone 's idea of a joke . Can you think of anyone at school with a grudge against you ? ";Fred;thirteen-year-old;0.3;448;8
" Yes , " said Harry and Ron together , instantly .;Harry;Ron,Fred,George,Uncle,Weasley;0.0;449;8
" Draco Malfoy , " Harry explained . " He hates me . ";Harry;Ron,Fred,George,Uncle,Weasley;0.0;450;8
" Draco Malfoy ? ";Ron;Harry,Fred,George,Uncle,Weasley;0.0;451;8
said George , turning around . " Not Lucius Malfoy 's son ? ";George;Harry,Ron,Fred,Uncle,Weasley;0.0;452;8
" Must be , it 's not a very common name , is it ? ";Ron;Harry,Fred,George,Uncle,Weasley;-0.39;453;8
" I 've heard Dad talking about him , " said George . " He was a big supporter of You-Know-Who . ";George;Dad;0.0;455;8
" And when You-Know-Who disappeared , " said Fred , craning around to look at Harry , " Lucius Malfoy came back saying he'd never meant any of it . Load of dung - Dad reckons he was right in You - Know-Who 's inner circle . ";Fred;You-Know-Who,Dad;0.0952380952381;456;8
" I do n't know whether the Malfoys own a house-elf ... ";Ron;Malfoy;0.6;459;8
" Well , whoever owns him will be an old wizarding family , and they 'll be rich , " said Fred .;Fred;Harry,Ron,George,Uncle,Weasley;0.2375;461;8
" Yeah , Mum 's always wishing we had a house-elf to do the ironing , " said George . " But all we 've got is a lousy old ghoul in the attic and gnomes all over the garden . House-elves come with big old manors and castles and places like that  ,  you would n't catch one in our house ... ";George;House;0.0666666666667;462;8
" I 'm glad we came to get you , anyway , " said Ron . " I was getting really worried when you did n't answer any of my letters . I thought it was Errol 's fault at first - ";Ron;Errol;0.25;467;8
" Who 's Errol ? ";Fred;Errol;0.0;468;8
" Our owl . He 's ancient . It would n't be the first time he'd collapsed on a delivery . So then I tried to borrow Hermes - ";Ron;Hermes;0.25;469;8
" Who ? ";George;Harry,Ron,Fred,Uncle,Weasley;0.0;470;8
" The owl Mum and Dad bought Percy when he was made prefect , " said Fred from the front .;Fred;Dad,Percy;0.0;471;8
" But Percy would n't lend him to me , " said Ron . " Said he needed him . ";Ron;Percy;0.0;472;8
" Percy 's been acting very oddly this summer , " said George , frowning . " And he has been sending a lot of letters and spending a load of time shut up in his room....I mean , there 's only so many times you can polish a prefect badge....You 're driving too far west , Fred , " he added , pointing at a compass on the dashboard .;George;Harry,Ron,Fred,Uncle,Weasley;0.08125;473;8
" So , does your dad know you 've got the car ? ";Fred;Harry,Ron,George,Uncle,Weasley;0.0;475;8
" Er , no , " said Ron , " he had to work tonight . Hopefully we 'll be able to get it back in the garage without Mum noticing we flew it . ";Ron;Harry,Fred,George,Uncle,Weasley;0.25;477;8
" What does your dad do at the Ministry of Magic , anyway ? ";Fred;Harry,Ron,George,Uncle,Weasley;0.5;478;8
" He works in the most boring department , " said Ron . " The Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office . ";Ron;Harry,Fred,George,Uncle,Weasley;-0.25;479;8
" The what ? ";Fred;Harry,Ron,George,Uncle,Weasley;0.0;480;8
" It 's all to do with bewitching things that are Muggle-made , you know , in case they end up back in a Muggle shop or house . Like , last year , some old witch died and her tea set was sold to an antiques shop . This Muggle woman bought it , took it home , and tried to serve her friends tea in it . It was a nightmare - Dad was working overtime for weeks . ";Ron;Dad,Muggle;0.2;481;8
" What happened ? ";Fred;Harry,Ron,George,Uncle,Weasley;0.0;482;8
" The teapot went berserk and squirted boiling tea all over the place and one man ended up in the hospital with the sugar tongs clamped to his nose . Dad was going frantic - it 's only him and an old warlock called Perkins in the office - and they had to do Memory Charms and all sorts of stuff to cover it up - ";Ron;Dad,Perkins;0.05;483;8
" But your dad - this car - ";George;Harry,Ron,Fred,Uncle,Weasley;0.0;484;8
Fred laughed . " Yeah , Dad 's crazy about everything to do with Muggles  ,  our shed 's full of Muggle stuff . He takes it apart , puts spells on it , and puts it back together again . If he raided our house he'd have to put himself under arrest . It drives Mum mad . ";Fred;Harry,Ron,George,Uncle,Weasley;-0.035;485;8
" That 's the main road , " said George , peering down through the windshield . " We 'll be there in ten minutes ... Just as well , it 's getting light ... ";George;Harry,Ron,Fred,Uncle,Weasley;0.102777777778;486;8
" We 're a little way outside the village , " said George . " Ottery St. Catchpole . ";George;Harry,Ron,Fred,Uncle,Weasley;-0.09375;489;8
" Touchdown ! ";Fred;Harry,Ron,George,Uncle,Weasley;0.0;492;8
" It 's not much , " said Ron .;Ron;Harry,Fred,George,Uncle,Weasley;0.1;500;8
" It 's wonderful , " said Harry happily , thinking of Privet Drive .;Harry;Ron,Fred,George,Uncle,Weasley;1.0;501;8
" Now , we 'll go upstairs really quietly , " said Fred , " and wait for Mum to call us for breakfast Then , Ron , you come bounding downstairs going , ' Mum , look who turned up in the night ! ' and she 'll be all pleased to see Harry and no one need ever know we flew the car . ";Fred;Harry,Ron,George,Uncle,Weasley;0.25;503;8
" Right , " said Ron . " Come on , Harry , I sleep at the - at the top - ";Ron;Harry,Fred,George,Uncle,Weasley;0.392857142857;504;8
" Ah , " said Fred .;Fred;Harry,Ron,George,Uncle,Weasley;0.0;508;8
" Oh , dear , " said George .;George;Harry,Ron,Fred,Uncle,Weasley;0.0;509;8
" So , " she said .;Ron;Harry,Fred,George,Uncle,Weasley;0.0;512;8
" Morning , Mum , " said George , in what he clearly thought was a jaunty , winning voice .;George;Harry,Ron,Fred,Uncle,Weasley;0.5;513;8
" Have you any idea how worried I 've been ? ";Ron;Harry,Fred,George,Uncle,Weasley;0.0;514;8
" Sorry , Mum , but see , we had to - ";Weasley;Harry,Ron,Fred,George,Uncle;-0.5;516;8
" Beds empty ! No note ! Car gone - could have crashed - out of my mind with worry - did you care ? - never , as long as I 've lived - you wait until your father gets home , we never had trouble like this from Bill or Charlie or Percy - ";Ron;Care;-0.103125;518;8
" Perfect Percy , " muttered Fred .;Fred;Harry,Ron,George,Uncle,Weasley;1.0;519;8
" YOU COULD DO WITH TAKING A LEAF OUT OF PERCY'S BOOK ! ";Ron;Harry,Fred,George,Uncle,Weasley;0.0;520;8
yelled Mrs. Weasley , prodding a finger in Fred 's chest . " You could have died , you could have been seen , you could have lost your father his job - ";Weasley;Harry,Ron,Fred,George,Uncle;0.0;521;8
" I 'm very pleased to see you , Harry , dear , " she said . " Come in and have some breakfast . ";Ron;Harry,Fred,George,Uncle,Weasley;0.65;524;8
And unless Harry 's ears were deceiving him , the old radio next to the sink had just announced that coming up was " Witching Hour , with the popular singing sorceress , Celestina Warbeck . ";Harry;Ron,Fred,George,Uncle,Weasley;0.233333333333;532;8
Every now and then she muttered things like " do n't know what you were thinking of , " and " never would have believed it . ";Ron;Harry,Fred,George,Uncle,Weasley;0.0;534;8
" I do n't blame you , dear , " she assured Harry , tipping eight or nine sausages onto his plate . " Arthur and I have been worried about you , too . Just last night we were saying we'd come and get you ourselves if you had n't written back to Ron by Friday . But really , " ( she was now adding three fried eggs to his plate ) " flying an illegal car halfway across the country - anyone could have seen you - ";Harry;Ron,Fred,George,Uncle,Weasley;-0.125;535;8
" It was cloudy , Mum ! ";Ron;Harry,Fred,George,Uncle,Weasley;0.0;537;8
" You keep your mouth closed while you 're eating ! ";Fred;Harry,Ron,George,Uncle,Weasley;-0.125;539;8
" They were starving him , Mum ! ";Ron;Harry,Fred,George,Uncle,Weasley;0.0;541;8
" And you ! ";Fred;Harry,Ron,George,Uncle,Weasley;0.0;543;8
" Ginny , " said Ron in an undertone to Harry . " My sister . She 's been talking about you all summer . ";Ron;Harry,Fred,George,Uncle,Weasley;0.0;546;8
" Yeah , she 'll be wanting your autograph , Harry , " Fred said with a grin , but he caught his mother 's eye and bent his face over his plate without another word .;Fred;Harry,Ron,George,Uncle,Weasley;0.0;547;8
" Blimey , I 'm tired , " yawned Fred , setting down his knife and fork at last . " I think I 'll go to bed and - ";Fred;Harry,Ron,George,Uncle,Weasley;-0.185185185185;549;8
" You will not , " snapped Mrs. Weasley . " It 's your own fault you 've been up all night . You 're going to de-gnome the garden for me  ,  they 're getting completely out of hand again - ";Weasley;Harry,Ron,Fred,George,Uncle;0.6;550;8
" Oh , Mum - ";Fred;Harry,Ron,George,Uncle,Weasley;0.0;551;8
" And you two , " she said , glaring at Ron and Fred . " You can go up to bed , dear , " she added to Harry . " You did n't ask them to fly that wretched car - ";Ron;Harry,Fred,George,Uncle,Weasley;0.8;552;8
But Harry , who felt wide awake , said quickly , " I 'll help Ron . I 've never seen a de-gnoming - ";Harry;Ron;-0.1;553;8
" That 's very sweet of you , dear , but it 's dull work , " said Mrs. Weasley . " Now , let 's see what Lockhart 's got to say on the subject - ";Weasley;Harry,Ron,Fred,George,Uncle;-0.00111111111111;554;8
" Mum , we know how to de-gnome a garden - ";Ron;Harry,Fred,George,Uncle,Weasley;0.0;557;8
" Oh , he is marvelous , " she said . " He knows his household pests , all right , it 's a wonderful book ... ";George;Harry,Ron,Fred,Uncle,Weasley;0.761904761905;563;8
" Mum fancies him , " said Fred , in a very audible whisper .;Fred;Harry,Ron,George,Uncle,Weasley;0.2;564;8
" Do n't be so ridiculous , Fred , " said Mrs. Weasley , her cheeks rather pink . " All right , if you think you know better than Lockhart , you can go and get on with it , and woe betide you if there 's a single gnome in that garden when I come out to inspect it . ";Weasley;Harry,Ron,Fred,George,Uncle;0.0561904761905;565;8
" Muggles have garden gnomes , too , you know , " Harry told Ron they crossed the lawn .;Harry;Muggle;0.0;569;8
" Yeah , I 've seen those things they think are gnomes , " said Ron , bent double with his head in a peony bush , " like fat little Santa Clauses with fishing rods ... ";Ron;Harry,Fred,George,Uncle,Weasley;-0.09375;570;8
There was a violent scuffling noise , the peony bush shuddered , and Ron straightened up . " This is a gnome , " he said grimly .;Ron;Harry,Fred,George,Uncle,Weasley;-0.8;571;8
" Gerroff me ! Gerroff me ! ";Fred;Harry,Ron,George,Uncle,Weasley;0.0;572;8
" This is what you have to do , " he said .;Ron;Harry,Fred,George,Uncle,Weasley;0.0;577;8
He raised the gnome above his head ( " Gerroff me ! " );Fred;Harry,Ron,George,Uncle,Weasley;0.0;578;8
Seeing the shocked look on Harry 's face , Ron added , " It does n't hurt them - you 've just got to make them really dizzy so they ca n't find their way back to the gnome holes . ";Ron;Harry,Fred,George,Uncle,Weasley;-0.233333333333;580;8
" Pitiful , " said Fred . " I bet I can get mine beyond that stump . ";Fred;Harry,Ron,George,Uncle,Weasley;0.0;582;8
" Wow , Harry - that must 've been fifty feet ... ";Ron;Harry,Fred,George,Uncle,Weasley;0.1;585;8
" See , they 're not too bright , " said George , seizing five or six gnomes at once . " The moment they know the de-gnoming 's going on they storm up to have a look . You'd think they'd have learned by now just to stay put . ";George;You'd;0.7;587;8
" They 'll be back , " said Ron as they watched the gnomes disappear into the hedge on the other side of the field . " They love it here....Dad 's too soft with them  ,  he thinks they 're funny ... ";Ron;Harry,Fred,George,Uncle,Weasley;0.145;589;8
" He 's back ! ";Fred;Harry,Ron,George,Uncle,Weasley;0.0;591;8
said George . " Dad 's home ! ";George;Harry,Ron,Fred,Uncle,Weasley;0.0;592;8
" What a night , " he mumbled , groping for the teapot as they all sat down around him . " Nine raids . Nine ! And old Mundungus Fletcher tried to put a hex on me when I had my back turned ... ";Ron;Fletcher;-0.0314814814815;596;8
" Find anything , Dad ? ";Fred;Harry,Ron,George,Uncle,Weasley;0.0;598;8
" All I got were a few shrinking door keys and a biting kettle , " yawned Mr. Weasley . " There was some pretty nasty stuff that was n't my department , though . Mortlake was taken away for questioning about some extremely odd ferrets , but that 's the Committee on Experimental Charms , thank goodness ... ";Weasley;Mortlake,Committee;-0.203333333333;600;8
" Why would anyone bother making door keys shrink ? ";Ron;Harry,Fred,George,Uncle,Weasley;0.0;601;8
" Just Muggle-baiting , " sighed Mr. Weasley . " Sell them a key that keeps shrinking to nothing so they can never find it when they need it....Of course , it 's very hard to convict anyone because no Muggle would admit their key keeps shrinking - they 'll insist they just keep losing it . Bless them , they 'll go to any lengths to ignore magic , even if it 's staring them in the face....But the things our lot have taken to enchanting , you would n't believe - ";Weasley;Muggle;0.0302083333333;603;8
" LIKE CARS , FOR INSTANCE ? ";Ron;Harry,Fred,George,Uncle,Weasley;0.0;604;8
" C-cars , Molly , dear ? ";Fred;Harry,Ron,George,Uncle,Weasley;0.0;608;8
" Yes , Arthur , cars , " said Mrs. Weasley , her eyes flashing . " Imagine a wizard buying a rusty old car and telling his wife all he wanted to do with it was take it apart to see how it worked , while really he was enchanting it to make it fly . ";Weasley;Harry,Ron,Fred,George,Uncle;0.3;609;8
" Well , dear , I think you 'll find that he would be quite within the law to do that , even if - er - he maybe would have done better to , um , tell his wife the truth....There 's a loophole in the law , you 'll find....As long as he was n't intending to fly the car , the fact that the car could fly would n't - ";Ron;Harry,Fred,George,Uncle,Weasley;0.5125;611;8
" Arthur Weasley , you made sure there was a loophole when you wrote that law ! ";Fred;Harry,Ron,George,Uncle,Weasley;0.625;612;8
shouted Mrs. Weasley . " Just so you could carry on tinkering with all that Muggle rubbish in your shed ! And for your information , Harry arrived this morning in the car you were n't intending to fly ! ";Weasley;Harry;1.0;613;8
" Harry ? ";Ron;Harry,Fred,George,Uncle,Weasley;0.0;614;8
said Mr. Weasley blankly . " Harry who ? ";Weasley;Harry,Ron,Fred,George,Uncle;0.0;615;8
" Good lord , is it Harry Potter ? Very pleased to meet you , Ron 's told us so much about - ";Ron;Harry;0.466666666667;617;8
" Your sons flew that car to Harry 's house and back last night ! ";Fred;Harry,Ron,George,Uncle,Weasley;0.0;618;8
shouted Mrs. Weasley . " What have you got to say about that , eh ? ";Weasley;Harry,Ron,Fred,George,Uncle;0.0;619;8
" Did you really ? ";Ron;Harry,Fred,George,Uncle,Weasley;0.0;620;8
said Mr. Weasley eagerly . " Did it go all right ? I - I mean , " he faltered as sparks flew from Mrs. Weasley 's eyes , " that - that was very wrong , boys - very wrong indeed ... ";Weasley;Harry,Ron,Fred,George,Uncle;-0.331696428571;621;8
" Let 's leave them to it , " Ron muttered to Harry as Mrs. Weasley swelled like a bullfrog . " Come on , I 'll show you my bedroom . ";Ron;Harry,Fred,George,Uncle,Weasley;0.0;622;8
" Ginny , " said Ron . " You do n't know how weird it is for her to be this shy . She never shuts up normally - ";Ron;Harry,Fred,George,Uncle,Weasley;-0.5;626;8
" Your Quidditch team ? ";Fred;Harry,Ron,George,Uncle,Weasley;0.0;631;8
" The Chudley Cannons , " said Ron , pointing at the orange bedspread , which was emblazoned with two giant black C 's and a speeding cannonball . " Ninth in the league . ";Ron;Harry,Fred,George,Uncle,Weasley;-0.0833333333333;633;8
" It 's a bit small , " said Ron quickly . " Not like that room you had with the Muggles . And I 'm right underneath the ghoul in the attic  ,  he 's always banging on the pipes and groaning ... ";Ron;Harry,Fred,George,Uncle,Weasley;0.0178571428571;639;8
But Harry , grinning widely , said , " This is the best house I 've ever been in . ";Harry;Ron,Fred,George,Uncle,Weasley;1.0;640;8
Harry got a shock the first time he looked in the mirror over the kitchen mantelpiece and it shouted , " Tuck your shirt in , scruffy ! ";Harry;Fred;0.3125;649;9
" Fascinating . ";Harry;Fred;0.7;654;9
he would say as Harry talked him through using a telephone . " Ingenious , really , how many ways Muggles have found of getting along without magic . ";Harry;Muggle;0.375;655;9
" Letters from school , " said Mr. Weasley , passing Harry and Ron identical envelopes of yellowish parchment , addressed in green ink . " Dumbledore already knows you 're here , Harry - does n't miss a trick , that man . You two 've got them , too , " he added , as Fred and George ambled in , still in their pajamas .;Fred;already;-0.2;662;9
" You 've been told to get all Lockhart 's books , too ! ";Fred;Lockhart;0.0;678;10
he said . " The new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher must be a fan - bet it 's a witch . ";Weasley;Fred,George,Percy,Ron,Errol;-0.00681818181818;679;10
" That lot wo n't come cheap , " said George , with a quick look at his parents . " Lockhart 's books are really expensive ... ";George;Fred,Weasley,Percy,Ron,Errol;-0.0888888888889;681;10
" Well , we 'll manage , " said Mrs. Weasley , but she looked worried . " I expect we 'll be able to pick up a lot of Ginny 's things secondhand . ";Weasley;Fred,George,Percy,Ron,Errol;0.2;682;10
" Oh , are you starting at Hogwarts this year ? ";George;Fred,Weasley,Percy,Ron,Errol;0.0;683;10
" Morning , all , " said Percy briskly . " Lovely day . ";Percy;Fred,George,Weasley,Ron,Errol;0.5;688;10
" Errol ! ";George;Fred,Weasley,Percy,Ron,Errol;0.0;690;10
said Ron , taking the limp owl from Percy and extracting a letter from under its wing . " Finally - he 's got Hermione 's answer . I wrote to her saying we were going to try and rescue you from the Dursleys . ";Ron;Hermione;-0.2;691;10
He carried Errol to a perch just inside the back door and tried to stand him on it , but Errol flopped straight off again so Ron lay him on the draining board instead , muttering , " Pathetic . ";Errol;Fred,George,Weasley,Percy,Ron;-0.266666666667;692;10
" ` Dear Ron , and Harry if you 're there ,;George;Fred,Weasley,Percy,Ron,Errol;0.0;694;10
" ` I hope everything went all right and that Harry is okay and that you did n't do anything illegal to get him out , Ron , because that would get Harry into trouble , too . I 've been really worried and if Harry is all right , will you please let me know at once , but perhaps it would be better if you used a different owl because I think another delivery might finish your one off .;Weasley;Harry;0.15306122449;695;10
" ' I 'm very busy with schoolwork , of course ' - How can she be ? ";George;Fred,Weasley,Percy,Ron,Errol;0.13;696;10
said Ron in horror . " We 're on vacation ! - ' and we 're going to London next Wednesday to buy my new books . Why do n't we meet in Diagon Alley ?;Weasley;Fred,George,Percy,Ron,Errol;0.0681818181818;697;10
" ' Let me know what 's happening as soon as you can . Love from Hermione . ' ";George;Fred,Weasley,Percy,Ron,Errol;0.5;698;10
" Well , that fits in nicely , we can go and get all your things then , too , " said Mrs. Weasley , starting to clear the table . " What 're you all up to today ? ";Weasley;Fred,George,Percy,Ron,Errol;0.05;699;10
" Wish I knew what he was up to , " said Fred , frowning . " He 's not himself . His exam results came the day before you did  ,  twelve O.W.L.s and he hardly gloated at all . ";Fred;George,Weasley,Percy,Ron,Errol;0.0;707;10
" Ordinary Wizarding Levels , " George explained , seeing Harry 's puzzled look . " Bill got twelve , too . If we 're not careful , we 'll have another Head Boy in the family . I do n't think I could stand the shame . ";George;Bill;-0.175;708;10
" Dunno how Mum and Dad are going to afford all our school stuff this year , " said George after a while . " Five sets of Lockhart books ! And Ginny needs robes and a wand and everything ... ";George;Dad,Ginny;0.0;712;10

With a roar , the fire turned emerald green and rose higher than Fred , who stepped right into it , shouted , " Diagon Alley ! ";Fred;Mrs.,Ron,Weasley,Harry;0.304910714286;735;11
" You must speak clearly , dear , " Mrs. Weasley told Harry as George dipped his hand into the flowerpot . " And be sure to get out at the right grate ... ";Weasley;Mrs.,Ron,Fred,Harry;0.392857142857;737;11

Mr. Malfoy crossed the shop , looking lazily at the items on display , and rang a bell on the counter before turning to his son and saying , " Touch nothing , Draco . ";Malfoy;Mr.,Draco;0.0;767;12
Malfoy , who had reached for the glass eye , said , " I thought you were going to buy me a present . ";Malfoy;Mr.,Draco;0.0;768;12

" Selling ? ";Mr.;Malfoy,Draco;0.0;778;12
" You have heard , of course , that the Ministry is conducting more raids , " said Mr. Malfoy , taking a roll of parchment from his inside pocket and unraveling it for Mr. Borgin to read .

" The Ministry would n't presume to trouble you , sir , surely ? ";Mr.;Ministry;0.0;782;12
" I have not been visited yet . The name Malfoy still commands a certain respect , yet the Ministry grows ever more meddlesome .

" I hope my son will amount to more than a thief or a plunderer , Borgin , " said Mr. Malfoy coldly , and Mr. Borgin said quickly , " No offense , sir , no offense meant - ";Mr.;Malfoy,Draco;0.5;792;12
" Though if his grades do n't pick up , " said Mr. Malfoy , more coldly still , " that may indeed be all he is fit for - ";Malfoy;Mr.,Draco;0.45;793;12
" It 's not my fault , " retorted Draco . " The teachers all have favorites , that Hermione Granger - ";Draco;Malfoy,Mr.;0.0;794;12

" It 's the same all over , " said Mr. Borgin , in his oily voice . " Wizard blood is counting for less everywhere - ";Mr.;Malfoy,Draco;-0.0833333333333;798;12

" In that case , perhaps we can return to my list , " said Mr. Malfoy shortly . " I am in something of a hurry , Borgin , I have important business elsewhere today - ";Mr.;Malfoy,Draco;0.4;801;12
He walked forward - he stretched out his hand for the handle " Done , " said Mr. Malfoy at the counter . " Come , Draco - ";Malfoy;Mr.,Draco;0.0;807;12

" It 's probably just tired , " said Ron . " It 's never been this far before ... ";Ron;Harry,miserably;-0.15;1121;17

" So , " he said softly , " the train is n't good enough for the famous Harry Potter and his faithful sidekick Weasley . Wanted to arrive with a bang , did we , boys ? ";Snape;Harry,enthusiastically,Prophet,Ron,again;0.383333333333;1225;18

But a moment later , he understood , as Snape unrolled today 's issue of the Evening Prophet . " You were seen , " he hissed , showing them the headline : FLYING FORD ANGLIA MYSTIFIES MUGGLES .;Prophet;Harry,enthusiastically,Snape,Ron,again;0.0;1231;18
He began to read aloud : " Two Muggles in London , convinced they saw an old car flying over the Post Office tower...at noon in Norfolk , Mrs. Hetty Bayliss , while hanging out her washing...Mr .

" I noticed , in my search of the park , that considerable damage seems to have been done to a very valuable Whomping Willow , " Snape went on .;Snape;Harry,enthusiastically,Prophet,Ron,again;0.15;1236;18
" That tree did more damage to us than we - " Ron blurted out .;Ron;Harry,enthusiastically,Snape,Prophet,again;0.5;1237;18
" Silence ! ";Snape;Harry,enthusiastically,Prophet,Ron,again;0.0;1238;18

" That , " said Professor McGonagall , " is obvious . ";Professor;Harry,Ron,Dumbledore,sagely,impatiently,Lee,thirteen-year-old,Dean,Neville;0.0;1258;19

" We 'll go and get our stuff , " said Ron in a hopeless sort of voice .;Ron;Harry,Professor,Dumbledore,sagely,impatiently,Lee,thirteen-year-old,Dean,Neville;0.0;1272;19

" Not today , Mr. Weasley , " said Dumbledore . " But I must impress upon both of you the seriousness of what you have done . I will be writing to both your families tonight .

He cleared his throat and said , " Professor Dumbledore , these boys have flouted the Decree for the Restriction of Underage Wizardry , caused serious damage to an old and valuable tree - surely acts of this nature - ";Harry;Ron,Professor,Dumbledore,sagely,impatiently,Lee,thirteen-year-old,Dean,Neville;-0.116666666667;1280;19

" Oh , good , " said Ron .;Ron;Harry,Professor,Dumbledore,sagely,impatiently,Lee,thirteen-year-old,Dean,Neville;0.65;1288;19
" And speaking of Gryffindor - " Professor McGonagall said sharply , but Harry cut in : " Professor , when we took the car , term had n't started , so - so Gryffindor should n't really have points taken from it - should it ? ";Professor;Gryffindor;0.0;1289;19
" I will not take any points from Gryffindor , " she said , and Harry 's heart lightened considerably . " But you will both get a detention . ";Harry;Ron,Professor,Dumbledore,sagely,impatiently,Lee,thirteen-year-old,Dean,Neville;0.0;1293;19
" You will eat in here and then go straight up to your dormitory , " she said . " I must also return to the feast . ";Ron;Harry,Professor,Dumbledore,sagely,impatiently,Lee,thirteen-year-old,Dean,Neville;0.2;1299;19

Harry shrugged . " We 'll have to watch our step from now on , though , " he said , taking a grateful swig of pumpkin juice . " Wish we could 've gone up to the feast ... ";Harry;Ron,Professor,Dumbledore,sagely,impatiently,Lee,thirteen-year-old,Dean,Neville;0.0;1306;19

Judging by Professor Sprout 's scowl , she did mind , but Lockhart said , " That 's the ticket , " and closed the greenhouse door in her face .;Professor;Lockhart,Harry,Hermione;-0.1;1419;21
" Harry , " said Lockhart , his large white teeth gleaming in the sunlight as he shook his head . " Harry , Harry , Harry . ";Lockhart;Professor,Harry,Hermione;0.107142857143;1420;21
" When I heard - well , of course , it was all my fault . Could have kicked myself . ";Professor;Lockhart,Harry,Hermione;0.0;1422;21
He was about to say so when Lockhart went on , " Do n't know when I 've been more shocked . Flying a car to Hogwarts ! Well , of course , I knew at once why you'd done it . Stood out a mile . Harry , Harry , Harry . ";Lockhart;Professor,Harry,Hermione;-0.125;1424;21
" Gave you a taste for publicity , did n't I ? ";Professor;Lockhart,Harry,Hermione;0.0;1426;21

" Oh , no , Professor , see - ";Professor;Lockhart,Harry,Hermione;0.0;1428;21
" Harry , Harry , Harry , " said Lockhart , reaching out and grasping his shoulder . " I understand . Natural to want a bit more once you 've had that first taste - and I blame myself for giving you that , because it was bound to go to your head - but see here , young man , you ca n't start flying cars to try and get yourself noticed . Just calm down , all right ? Plenty of time for all that when you 're older . Yes , yes , I know what you 're thinking ! ' It 's all right for him , he 's an internationally famous wizard already !

When Harry had taken his place between Ron and Hermione , she said , " We 'll be repotting Mandrakes today . Now , who can tell me the properties of the Mandrake ? ";Harry;Lockhart,Professor,Hermione;0.0;1435;21
" Mandrake , or Mandragora , is a powerful restorative , " said Hermione , sounding as usual as though she had swallowed the textbook . " It is used to return people who have been transfigured or cursed to their original state . ";Hermione;Lockhart,Professor,Harry;0.141666666667;1437;21

" The cry of the Mandrake is fatal to anyone who hears it , " she said promptly .;Lockhart;Mandrakes;0.0;1440;21
" Precisely . Take another ten points , " said Professor Sprout . " Now , the Mandrakes we have here are still very young . ";Professor;Lockhart,Harry,Hermione;0.065;1441;21
They looked quite unremarkable to Harry , who did n't have the slightest idea what Hermione meant by the " cry " of the Mandrake .;Hermione;Lockhart,Professor,Harry;0.0;1444;21
" Everyone take a pair of earmuffs , " said Professor Sprout .;Professor;Lockhart,Harry,Hermione;0.0;1445;21

" Potter and his friends may have simply been in the wrong place at the wrong time , " he said , a slight sneer curling his mouth as though he doubted it .

" Because - because - " Harry said , his heart thumping very fast  ,  something told him it would sound very far-fetched if he told them he had been led there by a bodiless voice no one but he could hear , " because we were tired and wanted to go to bed , " he said .;Harry;Lockhart,Filch,Dumbledore,nothing,Snape,Ron,Professor,patiently;0.115;2278;40

" I suggest , Headmaster , that Potter is not being entirely truthful , " he said . " It might be a good idea if he were deprived of certain privileges until he is ready to tell us the whole story .

" And what on earth 's a Squib ? ";Harry;earth;0.0;2306;40
" Well - it 's not funny really - but as it 's Filch , " he said . " A Squib is someone who was born into a wizarding family but has n't got any magic powers . Kind of the opposite of Muggle-born wizards , but Squibs are quite unusual . If Filch 's trying to learn magic from a Kwikspell course , I reckon he must be a Squib . It would explain a lot .

" But you have n't really got to know Mrs. Norris , " Ron told her bracingly . " Honestly , we 're much better off without her . ";Ron;Norris;0.25;2320;41
Ginny 's lip trembled . " Stuff like this does n't often happen at Hogwarts , " Ron assured her . " They 'll catch the maniac who did it and have him out of here in no time .

" Oh , very well , " he said slowly . " Let me see...the Chamber of Secrets ...;Professor;Chamber;0.2;2376;42
" You all know , of course , that Hogwarts was founded over a thousand years ago - the precise date is uncertain - by the four greatest witches and wizards of the age . The four school Houses are named after them : Godric Gryffindor , Helga Hufflepuff , Rowena Ravenclaw , and Salazar Slytherin . They built this castle together , far from prying Muggle eyes , for it was an age when magic was feared by common people , and witches and wizards suffered much persecution . ";Hermione;Hogwarts;0.3;2377;42
" For a few years , the founders worked in harmony together , seeking out youngsters who showed signs of magic and bringing them to the castle to be educated . But then disagreements sprang up between them . A rift began to grow between Slytherin and the others . Slytherin wished to be more selective about the students admitted to Hogwarts . He believed that magical learning should be kept within all-magic families . He disliked taking students of Muggle parentage , believing them to be untrustworthy .

" Slytherin , according to the legend , sealed the Chamber of Secrets so that none would be able to open it until his own true heir arrived at the school .

" Well , since the fluxweed has got to be picked at the full moon and the lacewings have got to be stewed for twenty-one days...I'd say it'd be ready in about a month , if we can get all the ingredients . ";Hermione;sharply,Ron;0.275;2601;46
" A month ? ";sharply;Hermione,Ron;0.0;2602;46
said Ron . " Malfoy could have attacked half the Muggle-borns in the school by then ! ";Ron;Malfoy;-0.208333333333;2603;46
But Hermione 's eyes narrowed dangerously again , and he added swiftly , " But it 's the best plan we 've got , so full steam ahead , I say . ";Hermione;sharply,Ron;0.675;2604;46
However , while Hermione was checking that the coast was clear for them to leave the bathroom , Ron muttered to Harry , " It 'll be a lot less hassle if you can just knock Malfoy off his broom tomorrow . ";Hermione;Malfoy;-0.0333333333333;2605;46
" Slytherin has better brooms than us , " he began . " No point denying it . But we 've got better people on our brooms . We 've trained harder than they have , we 've been flying in all weathers - " ( " Too true , " muttered George Weasley . " I have n't been properly dry since August " ) " - and we 're going to make them rue the day they let that little bit of slime , Malfoy , buy his way onto their team . ";George;Slytherin;0.165972222222;2615;47
" It 'll be down to you , Harry , to show them that a Seeker has to have something more than a rich father . Get to that Snitch before Malfoy or die trying , Harry , because we 've got to win today , we 've got to . ";Hooch;George,Fred;0.379861111111;2617;47
" So no pressure , Harry " said Fred , winking at him .;Fred;George,Hooch;0.0;2618;47
" On my whistle , " said Madam Hooch . " Three...two...one ... ";Hooch;George,Fred;0.0;2621;47

" Gotcha ! ";Fred;Lee,Bludger,Wood,George,Harry,angrily;0.0;2639;48
He did n't have a clue what was going on in the rest of the game until he heard Lee Jordan , who was commentating , say , " Slytherin lead , sixty points to zero . ';Lee;Slytherin;-0.4;2642;48
" Someone 's - tampered - with - this - Bludger - " Fred grunted , swinging his bat with all his might at it as it launched a new attack on Harry .;Fred;Lee,Bludger,Wood,George,Harry,angrily;0.136363636364;2645;48
" We need time out , " said George , trying to signal to Wood and stop the Bludger breaking Harry 's nose at the same time .;Bludger;Lee,Fred,Wood,George,Harry,angrily;0.0;2646;48
" What 's going on ? ";Harry;Lee,Fred,Bludger,Wood,George,angrily;0.0;2649;48
said Wood as the Gryffindor team huddled together , while Slytherins in the crowd jeered . " We 're being flattened . Fred , George , where were you when that Bludger stopped Angelina scoring ? ";Wood;Bludger,Angelina;0.0;2650;48
" We were twenty feet above her , stopping the other Bludger from murdering Harry , Oliver , " said George angrily . " Someone 's fixed it - it wo n't leave Harry alone . It has n't gone for anyone else all game . The Slytherins must have done something to it . ";George;Bludger,Slytherin,alone;-0.10625;2651;48
" But the Bludgers have been locked in Madam Hooch 's office since our last practice , and there was nothing wrong with them then ... ";Wood;Bludger;-0.25;2652;48
" Listen , " said Harry as she came nearer and nearer , " with you two flying around me all the time the only way I 'm going to catch the Snitch is if it flies up my sleeve . Go back to the rest of the team and let me deal with the rogue one . ";Harry;Snitch;0.0;2656;48
" Do n't be thick , " said Fred . " It 'll take your head off . ";Fred;Lee,Bludger,Wood,George,Harry,angrily;-0.3;2657;48
" Oliver , this is insane , " said Alicia Spinner angrily . " You ca n't let Harry deal with that thing on his own . Let 's ask for an inquiry ... ";angrily;Lee,Fred,Bludger,Wood,George,Harry;-0.2;2659;48
" If we stop now , we 'll have to forfeit the match ! ";Wood;Lee,Fred,Bludger,George,Harry,angrily;0.0;2660;48
said Harry . " And we 're not losing to Slytherin just because of a crazy Bludger ! Come on , Oliver , tell them to leave me alone ! ";Harry;Lee,Fred,Bludger,Wood,George,angrily;-0.9375;2661;48
" This is all your fault , " George said angrily to Wood . " ` Get the Snitch or die trying , ' what a stupid thing to tell him - ";George;Snitch;-0.8;2662;48
" Ready to resume play ? ";Harry;Lee,Fred,Bludger,Wood,George,angrily;0.2;2664;48
" All right , " he said . " Fred , George , you heard Harry - leave him alone and let him deal with the Bludger on his own . ";Wood;Harry;0.442857142857;2667;48
" Training for the ballet , Potter ? ";Fred;Lee,Bludger,Wood,George,Harry,angrily;0.0;2674;48
" What the - " he gasped , careening out of Harry 's way .;Harry;Gryffindor,Lockhart,Wood;0.0;2683;49
" Aha , " he said vaguely . " We 've won . ";Lockhart;Harry,Gryffindor,Wood;0.0;2688;49
" Oh , no , not you , " he moaned .;Harry;Gryffindor,Lockhart,Wood;0.0;2692;49
" Does n't know what he 's saying , " said Lockhart loudly to the anxious crowd of Gryffindors pressing around them . " Not to worry , Harry . I 'm about to fix your arm . ";Gryffindor;Harry,Lockhart,Wood;-0.25;2693;49
" No ! ";Lockhart;Harry,Gryffindor,Wood;0.0;2694;49
said Harry . " I 'll keep it like this , thanks ... ";Harry;Gryffindor,Lockhart,Wood;0.2;2695;49
" I do n't want a photo of this , Colin , " he said loudly .;Gryffindor;Harry,Lockhart,Wood;0.0;2698;49
" Lie back , Harry , " said Lockhart soothingly . " It 's a simple charm I 've used countless times - ";Lockhart;Harry,Gryffindor,Wood;0.0;2699;49
" Why ca n't I just go to the hospital wing ? ";Harry;Gryffindor,Lockhart,Wood;0.0;2700;49
" He should really , Professor , " said a muddy Wood , who could n't help grinning even though his Seeker was injured . " Great capture , Harry , really spectacular , your best yet , I'd say - ";Wood;Great;0.7;2702;49
" Stand back , " said Lockhart , who was rolling up his jade-green sleeves .;Lockhart;Harry,Gryffindor,Wood;0.0;2705;49
" No - do n't - " said Harry weakly , but Lockhart was twirling his wand and a second later had directed it straight at Harry 's arm .;Lockhart;Harry,Gryffindor,Wood;0.0666666666667;2706;49
" Ah , " said Lockhart . " Yes . Well , that can sometimes happen . But the point is , the bones are no longer broken . That 's the thing to bear in mind . So , Harry , just toddle up to the hospital wing - ah , Mr. Weasley , Miss Granger , would you escort him ? - and Madam Pomfrey will be able to - er - tidy you up a bit . ";Lockhart;Pomfrey;0.233333333333;2712;49
" You should have come straight to me ! ";Pomfrey;Ron,Hermione,Harry,Dobby,fiercely,Professor,Dumbledore;0.25;2722;50
she raged , holding up the sad , limp remainder of what , half an hour before , had been a working arm . " I can mend bones in a second - but growing them back - ";Dobby;Pomfrey,Ron,Hermione,Harry,fiercely,Professor,Dumbledore;-0.173333333333;2723;50
" You will be able to , wo n't you ? ";Harry;Pomfrey,Ron,Hermione,Dobby,fiercely,Professor,Dumbledore;0.5;2724;50
" I 'll be able to , certainly , but it will be painful , " said Madam Pomfrey grimly , throwing Harry a pair of pajamas . " You 'll have to stay the night ... ";Pomfrey;Ron,Hermione,Harry,Dobby,fiercely,Professor,Dumbledore;-0.1;2726;50
" How can you stick up for Lockhart now , Hermione , eh ? ";Dobby;Pomfrey,Ron,Hermione,Harry,fiercely,Professor,Dumbledore;0.0;2729;50
Ron called through the curtain as he pulled Harry 's limp fingers through the cuff . " If Harry had wanted deboning he would have asked . ";Ron;Harry;-0.2;2730;50
" Anyone can make a mistake , " said Hermione . " And it does n't hurt anymore , does it , Harry ? ";Hermione;Pomfrey,Ron,Harry,Dobby,fiercely,Professor,Dumbledore;0.0;2731;50
" No , " said Harry , getting into bed . " But it does n't do anything else either . ";Harry;Pomfrey,Ron,Hermione,Dobby,fiercely,Professor,Dumbledore;0.0;2732;50
" You 're in for a rough night , " she said , pouring out a steaming beakerful and handing it to him . " Regrowing bones is a nasty business . ";Dobby;Pomfrey,Ron,Hermione,Harry,fiercely,Professor,Dumbledore;-0.55;2736;50
Still tut-tutting about dangerous sports and inept teachers , Madam Pomfrey retreated , leaving Ron and Hermione to help Harry gulp down some water . " We won , though , " said Ron , a grin breaking across his face . " That was some catch you made . Malfoy 's face...he looked ready to kill ... ";Pomfrey;Ron,Hermione,Harry,Dobby,fiercely,Professor,Dumbledore;-0.185185185185;2739;50
" I want to know how he fixed that Bludger , " said Hermione darkly . " We can add that to the list of questions we 'll ask him when we 've taken the Polyjuice Potion , " said Harry , sinking back onto his pillows . " I hope it tastes better than this stuff ... ";Hermione;Pomfrey,Ron,Harry,Dobby,fiercely,Professor,Dumbledore;0.2;2740;50
" If it 's got bits of Slytherins in it ? You 've got to be joking , " said Ron .;Ron;Pomfrey,Hermione,Harry,Dobby,fiercely,Professor,Dumbledore;0.0;2741;50
Filthy and soaking wet , the rest of the Gryffindor team had arrived to see Harry . " Unbelievable flying , Harry , " said George . " I 've just seen Marcus Flint yelling at Malfoy . Something about having the Snitch on top of his head and not noticing . Malfoy did n't seem too happy . ";Harry;Flint;0.03;2743;50
They had brought cakes , sweets , and bottles of pumpkin juice  ,  they gathered around Harry 's bed and were just getting started on what promised to be a good party when Madam Pomfrey came storming over , shouting , " This boy needs rest , he 's got thirty-three bones to regrow ! Out ! OUT ! ";Pomfrey;Ron,Hermione,Harry,Dobby,fiercely,Professor,Dumbledore;1.0;2744;50
" Get off ! ";Dobby;Pomfrey,Ron,Hermione,Harry,fiercely,Professor,Dumbledore;0.0;2749;50
he said loudly , and then , " Dobby ! ";Harry;Pomfrey,Ron,Hermione,Dobby,fiercely,Professor,Dumbledore;0.0;2750;50
" Harry Potter came back to school , " he whispered miserably . " Dobby warned and warned Harry Potter . Ah sir , why did n't you heed Dobby ? Why did n't Harry Potter go back home when he missed the train ? ";Pomfrey;Harry;0.0;2753;50
" What 're you doing here ? ";Dobby;Pomfrey,Ron,Hermione,Harry,fiercely,Professor,Dumbledore;0.0;2755;50
he said . " And how did you know I missed the train ? ";Harry;Pomfrey,Ron,Hermione,Dobby,fiercely,Professor,Dumbledore;0.0;2756;50
" It was you ! ";Dobby;Pomfrey,Ron,Hermione,Harry,fiercely,Professor,Dumbledore;0.0;2758;50
he said slowly . " You stopped the barrier from letting us through ! ";Harry;Pomfrey,Ron,Hermione,Dobby,fiercely,Professor,Dumbledore;0.0;2759;50
" Indeed yes , sir , " said Dobby , nodding his head vigorously , ears flapping . " Dobby hid and watched for Harry Potter and sealed the gateway and Dobby had to iron his hands afterward " - he showed Harry ten long , bandaged fingers - " but Dobby did n't care , sir , for he thought Harry Potter was safe , and never did Dobby dream that Harry Potter would get to school another way ! ";Dobby;Dobby,Harry;0.1875;2760;50
" Dobby was so shocked when he heard Harry Potter was back at Hogwarts , he let his master 's dinner burn ! Such a flogging Dobby never had , sir ... ";Harry;Dobby,Harry,never;-0.291666666667;2762;50
" You nearly got Ron and me expelled , " he said fiercely . " You'd better get lost before my bones come back , Dobby , or I might strangle you . ";Dobby;Pomfrey,Ron,Hermione,Harry,fiercely,Professor,Dumbledore;0.25;2764;50
" Dobby is used to death threats , sir . Dobby gets them five times a day at home . ";Pomfrey;Dobby;0.0;2766;50
" Why d'you wear that thing , Dobby ? ";Harry;Pomfrey,Ron,Hermione,Dobby,fiercely,Professor,Dumbledore;0.0;2768;50
" This , sir ? ";Pomfrey;Ron,Hermione,Harry,Dobby,fiercely,Professor,Dumbledore;0.0;2770;50
said Dobby , plucking at the pillowcase . " ' Tis a mark of the house-elf 's enslavement , sir . Dobby can only be freed if his masters present him with clothes , sir . The family is careful not to pass Dobby even a sock , sir , for then he would be free to leave their house forever . ";Dobby;Dobby;0.075;2771;50
Dobby mopped his bulging eyes and said suddenly , " Harry Potter must go home ! Dobby thought his Bludger would be enough to make - ";Dobby;Harry,Bludger;0.0;2772;50
" Your Bludger ? ";Pomfrey;Ron,Hermione,Harry,Dobby,fiercely,Professor,Dumbledore;0.0;2773;50
said Harry , anger rising once more . " What d'you mean , your Bludger ? You made that Bludger try and kill me ? ";Harry;Pomfrey,Ron,Hermione,Dobby,fiercely,Professor,Dumbledore;-0.170833333333;2774;50
" Not kill you , sir , never kill you ! ";Pomfrey;Ron,Hermione,Harry,Dobby,fiercely,Professor,Dumbledore;0.0;2775;50
said Dobby , shocked . " Dobby wants to save Harry Potter 's life ! Better sent home , grievously injured , than remain here sir ! Dobby only wanted Harry Potter hurt enough to be sent home ! ";Dobby;Dobby,Harry;0.0;2776;50
" Oh , is that all ? ";Pomfrey;Ron,Hermione,Harry,Dobby,fiercely,Professor,Dumbledore;0.0;2777;50

" Ah , if Harry Potter only knew ! ";Pomfrey;Potter;0.0;2779;50
Dobby groaned , more tears dripping onto his ragged pillowcase . " If he knew what he means to us , to the lowly , the enslaved , we dregs of the magical world ! Dobby remembers how it was when He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named was at the height of his powers , sir ! We house-elves were treated like vermin , sir ! Of course , Dobby is still treated like that , sir , " he admitted , drying his face on the pillowcase . " But mostly , sir , life has improved for my kind since you triumphed over He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named . Harry Potter survived , and the Dark Lord 's power was broken , and it was a new dawn , sir , and Harry Potter shone like a beacon of hope for those of us who thought the Dark days would never end , sit...And now , at Hogwarts , terrible things are to happen , are perhaps happening already , and Dobby cannot let Harry Potter stay here now that history is to repeat itself , now that the Chamber of Secrets is open once more . ";Dobby;Dobby,He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named,Harry;0.148948863636;2780;50
A second later , he crawled back onto the bed , cross-eyed , muttering , " Bad Dobby , very bad Dobby ... ";Harry;Pomfrey,Ron,Hermione,Dobby,fiercely,Professor,Dumbledore;-0.283666666667;2782;50
" So there is a Chamber of Secrets ? ";Dobby;Chamber;0.0;2783;50
Harry whispered . " And did you say it 's been opened before ? Tell me , Dobby ! ";Harry;Pomfrey,Ron,Hermione,Dobby,fiercely,Professor,Dumbledore;0.0;2784;50
He seized the elf 's bony wrist as Dobby 's hand inched toward the water jug . " But I 'm not Muggle-born - how can I be in danger from the Chamber ? ";Dobby;Pomfrey,Ron,Hermione,Harry,fiercely,Professor,Dumbledore;0.0;2785;50
" Ah , sir , ask no more , ask no more of poor Dobby , " stammered the elf , his eyes huge in the dark . " Dark deeds are planned in this place , but Harry Potter must not be here when they happen - go home , Harry Potter , go home . Harry Potter must not meddle in this , sir , ' tis too dangerous - ";Harry;Harry;0.0142857142857;2786;50
" Who is it , Dobby ? ";Dobby;Pomfrey,Ron,Hermione,Harry,fiercely,Professor,Dumbledore;0.0;2787;50
Harry said , keeping a firm hold on Dobby 's wrist to stop him from hitting himself with the water jug again . " Who 's opened it ? Who opened it last time ? ";Harry;Pomfrey,Ron,Hermione,Dobby,fiercely,Professor,Dumbledore;-0.1;2788;50
" Dobby ca n't , sir , Dobby ca n't , Dobby must n't tell ! ";Dobby;Dobby;0.0;2789;50

" Harry Potter risks his own life for his friends ! ";Harry;Pomfrey,Ron,Hermione,Dobby,fiercely,Professor,Dumbledore;0.75;2793;50
moaned Dobby in a kind of miserable ecstasy . " So noble ! So valiant ! But he must save himself , he must , Harry Potter must not - ";Dobby;Harry;0.104166666667;2794;50
" Dobby must go ! ";Harry;Dobby;0.0;2798;50
" Get Madam Pomfrey , " whispered Dumbledore , and Professor McGonagall hurried past the end of Harry 's bed out of sight .;Professor;Pomfrey;-0.25;2806;50
" What happened ? ";Dobby;Pomfrey,Ron,Hermione,Harry,fiercely,Professor,Dumbledore;0.0;2810;50
" Another attack , " said Dumbledore . " Minerva found him on the stairs . ";Dumbledore;Minerva;0.0;2812;50
" There was a bunch of grapes next to him , " said Professor McGonagall . " We think he was trying to sneak up here to visit Potter . ";Professor;Potter;0.0;2813;50
" Petrified ? ";Dobby;Pomfrey,Ron,Hermione,Harry,fiercely,Professor,Dumbledore;0.0;2819;50

" What does this mean , Albus ? ";Dobby;Pomfrey,Ron,Hermione,Harry,fiercely,Professor,Dumbledore;-0.3125;2833;50

" All in order , " she said as he clumsily fed himself porridge left-handed . " When you 've finished eating , you may leave . ";Ron;Percy,Harry,Hermione;0.0;2849;51
" Oh , hello , Harry , " he said . " Excellent flying yesterday , really excellent . Gryffindor has just taken the lead for the House Cup - you earned fifty points ! ";Hermione;Gryffindor;1.0;2853;51

" No , I have n't , " said Percy , his smile fading . " I hope Ron 's not in another girls ' toilet ... ";Percy;Ron,Harry,Hermione;0.3;2856;51

" Fine , " said Harry , squeezing into the stall .;Harry;Ron,Percy,Hermione;0.416666666667;2864;51
" We'd 've come to meet you , but we decided to get started on the Polyjuice Potion , " Ron explained as Harry , with difficulty , locked the stall again . " We 've decided this is the safest place to hide it . ";Ron;We'd;0.0;2867;51
" We already know - we heard Professor McGonagall telling Professor Flitwick this morning . That 's why we decided we'd better get going - ";Hermione;Professor;0.5;2869;51
" The sooner we get a confession out of Malfoy , the better , " snarled Ron . " D'you know what I think ? He was in such a foul temper after the Quidditch match , he took it out on Colin . ";Ron;Colin;0.25;2870;51
" There 's something else , " said Harry , watching Hermione tearing bundles of knotgrass and throwing them into the potion . " Dobby came to visit me in the middle of the night . ";Hermione;Dobby;0.0;2871;51
" The Chamber of Secrets has been opened before ? ";Harry;Ron,Percy,Hermione;0.0;2875;51
" This settles it , " said Ron in a triumphant voice . " Lucius Malfoy must 've opened the Chamber when he was at school here and now he 's told dear old Draco how to do it . It 's obvious .

" Maybe it can make itself invisible , " said Hermione , prodding leeches to the bottom of the cauldron . " Or maybe it can disguise itself - pretend to be a suit of armor or something - I 've read about Chameleon Ghouls - ";Hermione;Ron,Percy,Harry;0.0;2878;51
" You read too much , Hermione , " said Ron , pouring dead lacewings on top of the leeches .;Ron;Percy,Harry,Hermione;0.133333333333;2879;51

" I think I'd better do the actual stealing , " Hermione continued in a matter-of-fact tone . " You two will be expelled if you get into any more trouble , and I 've got a clean record .

" As long as it 's not - " Harry began , but he ended on a groan : Gilderoy Lockhart was walking onto the stage , resplendent in robes of deep plum and accompanied by none other than Snape , wearing his usual black .;Harry;Hermione,Lockhart,Snape,Neville,Malfoy,Ron,Parselmouth;-0.118333333333;2946;54
Lockhart waved an arm for silence and called ' " Gather round , gather round ! Can everyone see me ? Can you all hear me ? Excellent !;Lockhart;Hermione,Harry,Snape,Neville,Malfoy,Ron,Parselmouth;0.125;2947;54

" Let me introduce my assistant , Professor Snape , " said Lockhart , flashing a wide smile . " He tells me he knows a tiny little bit about dueling himself and has sportingly agreed to help me with a short demonstration before we begin .

" As you see , we are holding our wands in the accepted combative position , " Lockhart told the silent crowd . " On the count of three , we will cast our first spells . Neither of us will be aiming to kill , of course . ";Lockhart;Hermione,Harry,Snape,Neville,Malfoy,Ron,Parselmouth;0.125;2956;54

Harry swung his wand high , but Malfoy had already started on " two " : His spell hit Harry so hard he felt as though he'd been hit over the head with a saucepan .;Harry;Hermione,Lockhart,Snape,Neville,Malfoy,Ron,Parselmouth;-0.0658333333333;2986;54

" So anyway , " a stout boy was saying , " I told Justin to hide up in our dormitory . I mean to say , if Potter 's marked him down as his next victim , it 's best if he keeps a low profile for a while . Of course , Justin 's been waiting for something like this to happen ever since he let slip to Potter he was Muggle-born . Justin actually told him he'd been down for Eton .

There was some heavy murmuring at this , and Ernie went on , " Remember what was written on the wall ? Enemies of the Heir , Beware . Potter had some sort of run-in with Filch .

He dropped his voice until it was barely more than a whisper , and said , " That 's probably why You - Know-Who wanted to kill him in the first place . Did n't want another Dark Lord competing with him . I wonder what other powers Potter 's been hiding ? ";Ernie;Know-Who,Voldemort;0.11875;3110;56

Percy , who had n't noticed that Fred had bewitched his prefect badge so that it now read " Pinhead , " kept asking them all what they were sniggering at .;Fred;matter-of-factly,Harry,Hermione;0.0;3321;61
" We still need a bit of the people you 're changing into , " said Hermione matter-of-factly , as though she were sending them to the supermarket for laundry detergent . " And obviously , it 'll be best if you can get something of Crabbe 's and Goyle ' s  ,  they 're Malfoys best friends , he 'll tell them anything .

She held up two plump chocolate cakes . " I 've filled these with a simple Sleeping Draught . All you have to do is make sure Crabbe and Goyle find them .

" Oh , all right , all right , " said Harry . " But what about you ? Whose hair are you ripping out ? ";Harry;Fred,matter-of-factly,Hermione;0.285714285714;3333;61
" I 've already got mine ! ";matter-of-factly;Fred,Harry,Hermione;0.0;3334;61
said Hermione brightly , pulling a tiny bottle out of her pocket and showing them the single hair inside it . " Remember Millicent Bulstrode wrestling with me at the Dueling Club ?

" I 'm sure I 've done everything right , " said Hermione , nervously rereading the splotched page of Moste Potente Potions . " It looks like the book says it should ... once we 've drunk it , we 'll have exactly an hour before we change back into ourselves . ";Hermione;Ron;0.0714285714286;3363;62

" Hang on , " said Harry as Ron and Hermione reached for their glasses . " We'd better not all drink them in here ... Once we turn into Crabbe and Goyle we wo n't fit . And Millicent Bulstrode 's no pixie . ";Ron;Millicent;0.45;3375;62

" One - two - three - ";Hermione;Ron;0.0;3381;62
Then he realized that his glasses were clouding his eyes because Goyle obviously did n't need them - he took them off and called , " Are you two okay ? ";Goyle;Crabbe,Ron,Harry,Hermione,Slytherin,Percy,Malfoy;0.5;3391;63

Mr. Lucius Malfoy , a governor of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry , where the enchanted car crashed earlier this year , called today for Mr. Weasley 's resignation . " Weasley has brought the Ministry into disrepute , " Mr. Malfoy told our reporter . " He is clearly unfit to draw up our laws and his ridiculous Muggle Protection Act should be scrapped immediately . ";Malfoy;Weasley,Protection;-0.166666666667;3488;64

" Ha , ha , " said Harry bleakly .;Harry;scornfully,Ron,Malfoy,Hermione,uncertainly,Myrtle;0.0;3493;65
" Arthur Weasley loves Muggles so much he should snap his wand in half and go and join them , " said Malfoy scornfully . " You'd never know the Weasleys were pure-bloods , the way they behave . ";scornfully;Weasley,never;-0.0333333333333;3494;65

" Well , go up to the hospital wing and give all those Mudbloods a kick from me , " said Malfoy , snickering . " You know , I 'm surprised the Daily Prophet has n't reported all these attacks yet , " he went on thoughtfully . " I suppose Dumbledore 's trying to hush it all up . He 'll be sacked if it does n't stop soon . Father 's always said old Dumbledore 's the worst thing that 's ever happened to this place . He loves Muggle-borns .

Malfoy started taking pictures with an imaginary camera and did a cruel but accurate impression of Colin : " ` Potter , can I have your picture , Potter ? Can I have your autograph ? Can I lick your shoes , please , Potter ? " ';Malfoy;Harry,scornfully,Ron,Hermione,uncertainly,Myrtle;-0.3;3500;65
" What 's the matter with you two ? ";Ron;Harry,scornfully,Malfoy,Hermione,uncertainly,Myrtle;0.0;3502;65
" Saint Potter , the Mudbloods ' friend , " said Malfoy slowly . " He 's another one with no proper wizard feeling , or he would n't go around with that jumped up Granger Mudblood . And people think he 's Slytherin 's heir ! ";Malfoy;Slytherin;0.0;3504;65
Harry and Ron waited with bated breath : Malfoy was surely seconds away from telling them it was him - but then " I wish I knew who it is , " said Malfoy petulantly . " I could help them . ";Harry;scornfully,Ron,Malfoy,Hermione,uncertainly,Myrtle;0.0;3505;65
Fortunately , Malfoy did n't notice , and Harry , thinking fast , said , " You must have some idea who 's behind it all ... ";Malfoy;Harry,scornfully,Ron,Hermione,uncertainly,Myrtle;-0.1;3507;65
" You know I have n't , Goyle , how many times do I have to tell you ? ";Ron;Harry,scornfully,Malfoy,Hermione,uncertainly,Myrtle;0.5;3508;65
snapped Malfoy . " And Father wo n't tell me anything about the last time the Chamber was opened either . Of course , it was fifty years ago , so it was before his time , but he knows all about it , and he says that it was all kept quiet and it 'll look suspicious if I know too much about it . But I know one thing - last time the Chamber of Secrets was opened , a Mudblood died . So I bet it 's a matter of time before one of them 's killed this time...I hope it 's Granger , " he said with relish .;Malfoy;Father,Chamber,Mudbloods,Granger;0.025;3509;65
Feeling that it would be a bit of a giveaway if Ron punched Malfoy , Harry shot him a warning look and said , " D'you know if the person who opened the Chamber last time was caught ? ";Ron;Chamber;0.0;3511;65
" Oh , yeah...whoever it was was expelled , " said Malfoy . " They 're probably still in Azkaban . ";Malfoy;Harry,scornfully,Ron,Hermione,uncertainly,Myrtle;0.0;3512;65

He shifted restlessly in his chair and said , " Father says to keep my head down and let the Heir of Slytherin get on with it . He says the school needs ridding of all the Mudblood filth , but not to get mixed up in it . Of course , he 's got a lot on his plate at the moment . You know the Ministry of Magic raided our manor last week ? ";Ron;Father,Magic,Ministry;0.0861111111111;3516;65

" Ho ! ";Ron;Harry,scornfully,Malfoy,Hermione,uncertainly,Myrtle;0.0;3520;65
" Medicine for my stomach , " Ron grunted , and without further ado they sprinted the length of the Slytherin common room , hurled themselves at the stone wall , and dashed up the passage , hoping against hope that Malfoy had n't noticed anything .;Malfoy;Harry,scornfully,Ron,Hermione,uncertainly,Myrtle;-0.15;3528;65
" Well , it was n't a complete waste of time , " Ron panted , closing the bathroom door behind them .

On the first page he could just make out the name " T M. Riddle " in smudged ink .;Harry;Ron,Flich,Myrtle,enthusiastically,Hermione;0.25;3631;68
" Hang on , " said Ron , who had approached cautiously and was looking over Harry 's shoulder . " I know that name...T . M. Riddle got an award for special services to the school fifty years ago . ";Ron;Harry,Flich,Myrtle,enthusiastically,Hermione;0.357142857143;3632;68
" How on earth d'you know that ? ";Harry;earth;0.0;3633;68
" Because Filch made me polish his shield about fifty times in detention , " said Ron resentfully . " That was the one I burped slugs all over . If you'd wiped slime off a name for an hour , you'd remember it , too . ";Ron;Filch;0.0;3635;68
" He never wrote in it , " said Harry , disappointed .;Harry;Ron,Flich,Myrtle,enthusiastically,Hermione;-0.75;3639;68
" I wonder why someone wanted to flush it away ? ";Ron;Harry,Flich,Myrtle,enthusiastically,Hermione;0.0;3640;68
" He must 've been Muggle-born , " said Harry thoughtfully . " To have bought a diary from Vauxhall Road ... ";Harry;Muggle;0.0;3643;68
" Well , it 's not much use to you , " said Ron .;Ron;Harry,Flich,Myrtle,enthusiastically,Hermione;0.1;3644;68
He dropped his voice . " Fifty points if you can get it through Myrtle 's nose . ";Harry;Myrtle;0.0;3645;68
" Oooh , it might have hidden powers , " said Hermione enthusiastically , taking the diary and looking at it closely .;enthusiastically;Ron,Harry,Flich,Myrtle,Hermione;-0.166666666667;3649;68
" If it has , it 's hiding them very well , " said Ron . " Maybe it 's shy . I do n't know why you do n't chuck it , Harry . ";Ron;Harry,Flich,Myrtle,enthusiastically,Hermione;-0.15;3650;68
" I wish I knew why someone did try to chuck it , " said Harry . " I would n't mind knowing how Riddle got an award for special services to Hogwarts either . ";Harry;Ron,Flich,Myrtle,enthusiastically,Hermione;0.357142857143;3651;68
" Could 've been anything , " said Ron . " Maybe he got thirty O.W.L.s or saved a teacher from the giant squid . Maybe he murdered Myrtle  ,  that would 've done everyone a favor ... ";Ron;O.W.L.s,Myrtle;0.0;3652;68
" What ? ";Harry;Ron,Flich,Myrtle,enthusiastically,Hermione;0.0;3654;68
" Well , the Chamber of Secrets was opened fifty years ago , was n't it ? ";Ron;Harry,Flich,Myrtle,enthusiastically,Hermione;0.0;3656;68
he said . " That 's what Malfoy said . ";Harry;Malfoy;0.0;3657;68
" Yeah ... ";Ron;Harry,Flich,Myrtle,enthusiastically,Hermione;0.0;3658;68
" And this diary is fifty years old , " said Hermione , tapping it excitedly .;Hermione;Ron,Harry,Flich,Myrtle,enthusiastically;0.1;3660;68
" So ? ";Ron;Harry,Flich,Myrtle,enthusiastically,Hermione;0.0;3661;68
" Oh , Ron , wake up , " snapped Hermione . " We know the person who opened the Chamber last time was expelled fifty years ago . We know T. M. Riddle got an award for special services to the school fifty years ago . Well , what if Riddle got his special award for catching the Heir of Slytherin ? His diary would probably tell us everything - where the Chamber is , and how to open it , and what sort of creature lives in it - the person who 's behind the attacks this time would n't want that lying around , would they ? ";Hermione;Chamber;0.152380952381;3662;68
" That 's a brilliant theory , Hermione , " said Ron , " with just one tiny little flaw . There 's nothing written in his diary . ";Ron;Harry,Flich,Myrtle,enthusiastically,Hermione;0.2375;3663;68
" It might be invisible ink ! ";Harry;Ron,Flich,Myrtle,enthusiastically,Hermione;0.0;3665;68
She tapped the diary three times and said , " Aparecium ! ";Hermione;Ron,Harry,Flich,Myrtle,enthusiastically;0.0;3667;68
" It 's a Revealer , I got it in Diagon Alley , " she said .;Harry;Revealer,Alley;0.0;3670;68
" I 'm telling you , there 's nothing to find in there , " said Ron . " Riddle just got a diary for Christmas and could n't be bothered filling it in . ";Ron;Harry,Flich,Myrtle,enthusiastically,Hermione;0.0;3673;68
It did n't carry details of why it had been given to him ( " Good thing , too , or it'd be even bigger and I'd still be polishing it , " said Ron ) .;Ron;I'd;0.325;3681;68
" He sounds like Percy , " said Ron , wrinkling his nose in disgust . " Prefect , Head Boy ...probably top of every class - ";Ron;Harry,Flich,Myrtle,enthusiastically,Hermione;0.5;3683;68
" You say that like it 's a bad thing , " said Hermione in a slightly hurt voice .;Hermione;Ron,Harry,Flich,Myrtle,enthusiastically;-0.616666666667;3684;68
" The moment their acne clears up , they 'll be ready for repotting again , " Harry heard her telling Filch kindly one afternoon . " And after that , it wo n't be long until we 're cutting them up and stewing them . You 'll have Mrs. Norris back in no time . ";Harry;Norris;-0.1125;3689;69
He was still convinced that Harry was the guilty one , that he had " given himself away " at the Dueling Club .;Harry;Lockhart;-0.5;3694;69
Peeves was n't helping matters  ,  he kept popping up in the crowded corridors singing " Oh , Potter , you rotter ... ";Harry;Lockhart;0.0;3695;69
Harry overheard him telling Professor McGonagall so while the Gryffindors were lining up for Transfiguration . " I do n't think there 'll be any more trouble , Minerva , " he said , tapping his nose knowingly and winking . " I think the Chamber has been locked for good this time . The culprit must have known it was only a matter of time before I caught him . Rather sensible to stop now , before I came down hard on him .;Harry;Chamber;0.140555555556;3698;69
" You know , what the school needs now is a morale-booster . Wash away the memories of last term ! I wo n't say any more just now , but I think I know just the thing ... ";Harry;Lockhart;0.25;3699;69
" What 's going on ? ";Harry;Lockhart;0.0;3707;69
" Happy Valentine 's Day ! ";Harry;Lockhart;1.0;3714;69
Lockhart shouted . " And may I thank the forty-six people who have so far sent me cards ! Yes , I have taken the liberty of arranging this little surprise for you all - and it does n't end here ! ";Lockhart;Harry;-0.0390625;3715;69
" My friendly , card-carrying cupids ! ";Harry;Lockhart;0.46875;3719;69
beamed Lockhart . " They will be roving around the school today delivering your valentines ! And the fun does n't stop here ! I 'm sure my colleagues will want to enter into the spirit of the occasion ! Why not ask Professor Snape to show you how to whip up a Love Potion ! And while you 're at it , Professor Flitwick knows more about Entrancing Enchantments than any wizard I 've ever met , the sly old dog ! ";Lockhart;Professor;0.5796875;3720;69
" Please , Hermione , tell me you were n't one of the forty-six , said Ron as they left the Great Hall for their first lesson . Hermione suddenly became very interested in searching her bag for her schedule and did n't answer .;Harry;Hermione,Ron;0.34375;3723;69
" Oy , you ! ' Arry Potter ! ";Harry;Lockhart;0.0;3725;69
" I 've got a musical message to deliver to ' Arry Potter in person , " he said , twanging his harp in a threatening sort of way .;Harry;Lockhart;0.0;3729;69
" Not here , " Harry hissed , trying to escape .;Harry;Lockhart;0.0;3730;69
" Stay still ! ";Harry;Lockhart;0.0;3731;69
" Let me go ! ";Harry;Lockhart;0.0;3733;69
" What 's going on here ? ";Harry;Lockhart;0.0;3738;69
" What 's all this commotion ? ";Harry;Lockhart;0.0;3741;69
" Right , " he said , sitting on Harry 's ankles . " Here is your singing valentine :;Harry;Lockhart;0.285714285714;3744;69
" Off you go , off you go , the bell rang five minutes ago , off to class , now , " he said , shooing some of the younger students away . " And you , Malfoy - ";Percy;Harry,Malfoy;0.0;3754;70
" Give that back , " said Harry quietly .;Harry;Percy,Malfoy;0.0;3757;70
" Wonder what Potter 's written in this ? ";Malfoy;Harry,Percy;0.0;3758;70
" Hand it over , Malfoy , " said Percy sternly .;Percy;Harry,Malfoy;0.0;3762;70
" When I 've had a look , " said Malfoy , waving the diary tauntingly at Harry .;Malfoy;Harry,Percy;0.0;3763;70
Percy said , " As a school prefect - " but Harry had lost his temper .;Percy;Harry,Malfoy;0.0;3764;70
He pulled out his wand and shouted , " Expelliarmus ! ";Malfoy;Harry,Percy;0.0;3765;70
" Harry ! ";Harry;Percy,Malfoy;0.0;3768;70
said Percy loudly . " No magic in the corridors . I 'll have to report this , you know ! ";Percy;Harry,Malfoy;0.625;3769;70
Malfoy was looking furious , and as Ginny passed him to enter her classroom , he yelled spitefully after her , " I do n't think Potter liked your valentine much ! ";Malfoy;Potter;0.4375;3771;70
This was partly because he did n't think he could stand Fred and George singing , " His eyes are as green as a fresh pickled toad " one more time , and partly because he wanted to examine Riddle 's diary again , and knew that Ron thought he was wasting his time .;Fred;Harry,Wizardry,nearly;0.2;3780;71
Excited , Harry loaded up his quill a second time and wrote , " My name is Harry Potter . ";Harry;Harry;0.1875;3784;71
" Hello , Harry Potter . My name is Tom Riddle . How did you come by my diary ? ";nearly;Fred,Harry,Wizardry;0.0;3788;71
" Someone tried to flush it down a toilet . ";Harry;Fred,Wizardry,nearly;-0.155555555556;3790;71
" Lucky that I recorded my memories in some more lasting way than ink . But I always knew that there would be those who would not want this diary read . ";nearly;Fred,Harry,Wizardry;0.277777777778;3792;71
" What do you mean ? ";Harry;Fred,Wizardry,nearly;-0.3125;3793;71
Things that happened at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry . ";Wizardry;Fred,Harry,nearly;0.0;3797;71
" That 's where I am now , " Harry wrote quickly . " I 'm at Hogwarts , and horrible stuff 's been happening . Do you know anything about the Chamber of Secrets ? ";Harry;Fred,Wizardry,nearly;-1.0;3798;71
" Of course I know about the Chamber of Secrets . In my day , they told us it was a legend , that it did not exist . But this was a lie . In my fifth year , the Chamber was opened and the monster attacked several students , finally killing one . I caught the person who'd opened the Chamber and he was expelled . But the Headmaster , Professor Dippet , ashamed that such a thing had happened at Hogwarts , forbade me to tell the truth . A story was given out that the girl had died in a freak accident . They gave me a nice , shiny , engraved trophy for my trouble and warned me to keep my mouth shut . But I knew it could happen again . The monster lived on , and the one who had the power to release it was not imprisoned . ";Wizardry;Chamber;0.2;3801;71
" It 's happening again now . There have been three attacks and no one seems to know who 's behind them . Who was it last time ? ";nearly;Fred,Harry,Wizardry;-0.2;3803;71
" I can show you , if you like , " came Riddle 's reply . " You do n't have to take my word for it . I can take you inside my memory of the night when I caught him . ";Wizardry;Fred,Harry,nearly;0.0;3804;71
" Let me show you . ";Harry;Fred,Wizardry,nearly;0.0;3810;71
" I 'm sorry , " he said shakily . " I did n't mean to butt in - ";Harry;Dippet;-0.40625;3821;72
Harry drew nearer to his desk and stammered , " Er - I 'll just go , shall I ? ";Harry;Dippet;0.0;3824;72
" Sorry I disturbed you . I 'll go now , " he half-shouted .;Harry;Dippet;-0.5;3828;72
" Enter , " said the old wizard in a feeble voice .;Harry;Dippet;-0.2;3836;72
" Ah , Riddle , " said the Headmaster .;Harry;Dippet;0.0;3840;72
" You wanted to see me , Professor Dippet ? ";Harry;Dippet;0.0;3841;72
" Sit down , " said Dippet . " I 've just been reading the letter you sent me . ";Dippet;Harry;-0.155555555556;3844;72
" Oh , " said Riddle .;Harry;Dippet;0.0;3845;72
" My dear boy , " said Dipper kindly , " I cannot possibly let you stay at school over the summer . Surely you want to go home for the holidays ? ";Harry;Dippet;0.0;3847;72
" No , " said Riddle at once . " I'd much rather stay at Hogwarts than go back to that - to that - ";Harry;Dippet;0.05;3848;72
" You live in a Muggle orphanage during the holidays , I believe ? ";Dippet;Harry;0.136363636364;3849;72
" Yes , sir , " said Riddle , reddening slightly .;Harry;Dippet;0.0;3851;72
" You are Muggle-born ? ";Harry;Muggle;0.0;3852;72
" Half-blood , sir , " said Riddle . " Muggle father , witch mother . ";Harry;Dippet;0.0;3853;72
" And are both your parents - ? ";Harry;Dippet;0.0;3854;72
" My mother died just after I was born , sir . They told me at the orphanage she lived just long enough to name me - Tom after my father , Marvolo after my grandfather . ";Harry;Dippet;-0.025;3855;72
" The thing is , Tom , " he sighed , " Special arrangements might have been made for you , but in the current circumstances ... ";Harry;Dippet;0.178571428571;3857;72
" You mean all these attacks , sir ? ";Harry;Dippet;-0.3125;3858;72
" Precisely , " said the headmaster . " My dear boy , you must see how foolish it would be of me to allow you to remain at the castle when term ends . Particularly in light of the recent tragedy ... the death of that poor little girl ... You will be safer by far at your orphanage . As a matter of fact , the Ministry of Magic is even now talking about closing the school . We are no nearer locating the - er - source of all this unpleasantness ... ";Harry;Magic;0.06875;3860;72
" Sir - if the person was caught - if it all stopped - ";Harry;Dippet;0.0;3862;72
" What do you mean ? ";Harry;Dippet;-0.3125;3863;72
said Dippet with a squeak in his voice , sitting up in his chair . " Riddle , do you mean you know something about these attacks ? ";Dippet;Harry;-0.3125;3864;72
" No , sir , " said Riddle quickly .;Harry;Dippet;0.0;3865;72
But Harry was sure it was the same sort of " no " that he himself had given Dumbledore .;Harry;Dippet;0.25;3866;72
" You may go , Tom ... ";Harry;Dippet;0.0;3868;72
" What are you doing , wandering around this late , Tom ? ";Harry;;-0.3;3877;73
" I had to see the headmaster , sir , " said Riddle .;Harry;;0.0;3880;73
" Well , hurry off to bed , " said Dumbledore , giving Riddle exactly the kind of penetrating stare Harry knew so well . " Best not to roam the corridors these days . Not since ... ";Harry;;0.8;3881;73
" C ' mon...gotta get yeh outta here...C ' mon now...in the box ... ";Harry;Ron;0.0;3894;74
" Evening , Rubeus , " said Riddle sharply .;Harry;Ron;0.0;3899;74
" What yer doin ' down here , Tom ? ";Harry;Ron;-0.155555555556;3901;74
" It 's all over , " he said . " I 'm going to have to turn you in , Rubeus . They 're talking about closing Hogwarts if the attacks do n't stop . ";Harry;Hogwarts;0.0;3903;74
" ' N at d'yeh - ";Harry;Ron;0.0;3904;74
" I do n't think you meant to kill anyone . But monsters do n't make good pets . I suppose you just let it out for exercise and - ";Harry;Ron;0.65;3905;74
" It never killed no one ! ";Harry;Ron;0.0;3906;74
" Come on , Rubeus , " said Riddle , moving yet closer . " The dead girl 's parents will be here tomorrow . The least Hogwarts can do is make sure that the thing that killed their daughter is slaughtered ... ";Harry;Hogwarts;0.0;3909;74
" It was n't him ! ";Harry;Ron;0.0;3910;74
roared the boy , his voice echoing in the dark passage . " He wouldn ' ! He never ! ";Harry;Ron;-0.234375;3911;74
" Stand aside , " said Riddle , drawing out his wand .;Harry;Ron;0.0;3912;74
Riddle scrambled to his feet , looking after it  ,  he raised his wand , but the huge boy leapt on him , seized his wand , and threw him back down , yelling , " NOOOOOO ! ";Harry;Ron;0.101851851852;3918;74
" There you are , " he said .;Harry;Ron;0.0;3921;74
" What 's up ? ";Harry;Ron;0.0;3924;74
" It was Hagrid , Ron . Hagrid opened the Chamber of Secrets fifty years ago . ";Ron;Hagrid,Chamber;0.0;3926;74
During their first year at Hogwarts he had tried to raise a dragon in his little wooden house , and it would be a long time before they forgot the giant , three-headed dog he'd christened " Fluffy . ";Harry;Hermione,Ron,Ernie;0.0025;3933;75
" Riddle might have got the wrong person , " said Hermione . " Maybe it was some other monster that was attacking people ... ";Hermione;Harry,Ron,Ernie;-0.3125;3939;75
" How many monsters d'you think this place can hold ? ";Ernie;Hermione,Harry,Ron;0.5;3940;75
" We always knew Hagrid had been expelled , " said Harry miserably . " And the attacks must 've stopped after Hagrid was kicked out . Otherwise , Riddle would n't have got his award . ";Harry;Hagrid;0.0;3942;75
" Riddle does sound like Percy - who asked him to squeal on Hagrid , anyway ? ";Ernie;Hermione,Harry,Ron;0.4;3944;75
" But the monster had killed someone , Ron , " said Hermione .;Hermione;Harry,Ron,Ernie;0.0;3945;75
" And Riddle was going to go back to some Muggle orphanage if they closed Hogwarts , " said Harry . " I do n't blame him for wanting to stay here ... ";Harry;Hogwarts;-0.05;3946;75
" You met Hagrid down Knockturn Alley , did n't you , Harry ? ";Hermione;Hagrid;-0.155555555556;3947;75

Peeves had finally got bored of his " Oh , Potter , you rotter " song , Ernie Macmillan asked Harry quite politely to pass a bucket of leaping toadstools in Herbology one day , and in March several of the Mandrakes threw a loud and raucous party in greenhouse three .;Ernie;Hermione,Harry,Ron;-0.175;3955;75
" The moment they start trying to move into each other 's pots , we 'll know they 're fully mature , " she told Harry . " Then we 'll be able to revive those poor people in the hospital wing . ";Harry;Hermione,Ron,Ernie;0.01875;3957;75

" Depends where you want to go , Harry , " he said . " It 's never too early to think about the future , so I'd recommend Divination . People say Muggle Studies is a soft option , but I personally think wizards should have a thorough understanding of the non-magical community , particularly if they 're thinking of working in close contact with them - look at my father , he has to deal with Muggle business all the time . My brother Charlie was always more of an outdoor type , so he went for Care of Magical Creatures . Play to your strengths , Harry . ";Harry;I'd,Muggle;0.24;3973;76

She rolled up the parchment from which she had been reading and said in a somewhat choked voice , " I need hardly add that I have rarely been so distressed .

" We 've got to go and talk to him , " said Harry , making up his mind . " I ca n't believe it 's him this time , but if he set the monster loose last time he 'll know how to get inside the Chamber of Secrets , and that 's a start . ";Harry;Gryffindor,Lee,George,quietly;-0.0384615384615;4080;79

Ron breathed . " Cornelius Fudge , the Minister of Magic ! ";Ron;Cornelius;0.625;4118;80
" Bad business , Hagrid , " said Fudge in rather clipped tones . " Very bad business . Had to come . Four attacks on Muggle-borns . Things 've gone far enough . Ministry 's got to act . ";Malfoy;Hagrid,Harry,Ron,Dumbledore,Fang,smoothly,sharply;-0.329583333333;4122;80

" Dreadful thing , Dumbledore , " said Malfoy lazily , taking out a long roll of parchment , " but the governors feel it 's time for you to step aside . This is an Order of Suspension - you 'll find all twelve signatures on it . I 'm afraid we feel you 're losing your touch . How many attacks have there been now ?

" Dear , dear , you know , that temper of yours will lead you into trouble one of these days , Hagrid , " said Mr. Malfoy . " I would advise you not to shout at the Azkaban guards like that . They wo n't like it at all . ";Malfoy;Hagrid,Harry,Ron,Dumbledore,Fang,smoothly,sharply;0.0;4154;80

Fudge , fiddling with his bowler , waited for Hagrid to go ahead of him , but Hagrid stood his ground , took a deep breath , and said carefully , " If anyone wanted ter find out some stuff , all they'd have ter do would be ter follow the spiders .

" I always thought Father might be the one who got rid of Dumbledore , " he said , not troubling to keep his voice down . " I told you he thinks Dumbledore 's the worst headmaster the school 's ever had . Maybe we 'll get a decent headmaster now . Someone who wo n't want the Chamber of Secrets closed .

" Yeah , right , " said Malfoy , smirking . " I expect you'd have Father 's vote , sir , if you wanted to apply for the job - I 'll tell Father you 're the best teacher here , sir - ";Malfoy;Father;0.642857142857;4200;82

" Let me at him , " Ron growled as Harry and Dean hung onto his arms . " I do n't care , I do n't need my wand , I 'm going to kill him with my bare hands - ";Ron;Malfoy,Snape,Dean,Ernie,Harry,Lockhart;0.05;4204;82

Ernie took a deep breath and said , very formally , " I just want to say , Harry , that I 'm sorry I ever suspected you . I know you'd never attack Hermione Granger , and I apologize for all the stuff I said . We 're all in the same boat now , and , well - ";Ernie;Hermione;-0.075;4210;82

" But that was years ago , " said Aragog fretfully . " Years and years ago . I remember it well . That 's why they made him leave the school .

When I was discovered , and blamed for the death of a girl , he protected me . I have lived here in the forest ever since , where Hagrid still visits me .

Its methods of killing are most wondrous , for aside from its deadly and venomous fangs , the Basilisk has a murderous stare , and all who are fixed with the beam of its eye shall suffer instant death .

" Harry - there 's something up there - " said Ron hoarsely , grabbing Harry 's shoulder .;hoarsely;Harry,Ron,sharply;0.0;4786;94
" Maybe it 's asleep , " he breathed , glancing back at the other two .;Harry;Ron,hoarsely,sharply;-0.0625;4790;94

" The adventure ends here , boys ! ";Ron;Harry,hoarsely,sharply;0.0;4802;94
he said . " I shall take a bit of this skin back up to the school , tell them I was too late to save the girl , and that you two tragically lost your minds at the sight of her mangled body - say good-bye to your memories ! ";Harry;Ron,hoarsely,sharply;-0.1875;4803;94
He raised Ron 's Spellotaped wand high over his head and yelled , " Obliviate ! ";Ron;Harry,hoarsely,sharply;0.2;4804;94
" Ron ! ";Harry;Ron,hoarsely,sharply;0.0;4808;94

" I 'm here ! ";Harry;Ron,hoarsely,sharply;0.0;4810;94
came Ron 's muffled voice from behind the rockfall . " I 'm okay - this git 's not , though - he got blasted by the wand - ";Ron;Harry,hoarsely,sharply;-0.166666666667;4811;94
There was a dull thud and a loud " ow ! ";Harry;Ron,hoarsely,sharply;-0.119791666667;4812;94
" What now ? ";hoarsely;Harry,Ron,sharply;0.0;4814;94
Ron 's voice said , sounding desperate . " We ca n't get through - it 'll take ages ... ";Ron;Harry,hoarsely,sharply;-0.6;4815;94
There was another thud and another " ow ! ";Harry;Ron,hoarsely,sharply;0.0;4819;94
" Wait there , " he called to Ron . " Wait with Lockhart . I 'll go on...If I 'm not back in an hour ... ";Ron;Harry,hoarsely,sharply;0.0;4823;94
There was a very pregnant pause , " I 'll try and shift some of this rock , " said Ron , who seemed to be trying to keep his voice steady . " So you can - can get back through . And , Harry - ";Ron;Harry,hoarsely,sharply;0.2;4824;94
" See you in a bit , " said Harry , trying to inject some confidence into his shaking voice .;Harry;Ron,hoarsely,sharply;0.0;4825;94

" Ginny ! ";;Harry,urgently,Potter,Tom,triumphantly,slowly;0.0;4856;96
Harry muttered , sprinting to her and dropping to his knees . " Ginny - do n't be dead - please do n't be dead - " He flung his wand aside , grabbed Ginny 's shoulders , and turned her over .;Harry;urgently,Potter,Tom,triumphantly,slowly,;-0.2;4857;96
" Ginny , please wake up , " Harry muttered desperately , shaking her .;Harry;urgently,Potter,Tom,triumphantly,slowly,;0.0;4860;96
" She wo n't wake , " said a soft voice .;;Harry,urgently,Potter,Tom,triumphantly,slowly;0.1;4862;96

" What d'you mean , she wo n't wake ? ";;Harry,urgently,Potter,Tom,triumphantly,slowly;-0.3125;4869;96
Harry said desperately . " She 's not - she 's not - ? ";Harry;urgently,Potter,Tom,triumphantly,slowly,;0.0;4870;96
" She 's still alive , " said Riddle . " But only just . ";;Harry,urgently,Potter,Tom,triumphantly,slowly;0.05;4871;96
" Are you a ghost ? ";Harry;urgently,Potter,Tom,triumphantly,slowly,;0.0;4874;96
" A memory , " said Riddle quietly . " Preserved in a diary for fifty years . ";;Harry,urgently,Potter,Tom,triumphantly,slowly;0.0;4876;96
" You 've got to help me , Tom , " Harry said , raising Ginny 's head again . " We 've got to get her out of here . There 's a basilisk...I do n't know where it is , but it could be along any moment...Please , help me . ";Harry;urgently,Potter,Tom,triumphantly,slowly,;0.0;4880;96
" Did you see - ? ";;Harry,urgently,Potter,Tom,triumphantly,slowly;0.0;4884;96
" Thanks , " said Harry , stretching out his hand for it .;Harry;urgently,Potter,Tom,triumphantly,slowly,;0.2;4887;96
" Listen , " said Harry urgently , his knees sagging with Ginny 's dead weight . " We 've got to go ! If the basilisk comes - ";urgently;Harry,Potter,Tom,triumphantly,slowly,;-0.25;4890;96
" It wo n't come until it is called , " said Riddle calmly .;;Harry,urgently,Potter,Tom,triumphantly,slowly;0.0;4891;96

" What d'you mean , I wo n't be - ? ";;Harry,urgently,Potter,Tom,triumphantly,slowly;-0.3125;4898;96

" Look , " said Harry , losing patience , " I do n't think you get it . We 're in the Chamber of Secrets . We can talk later - ";Harry;urgently,Potter,Tom,triumphantly,slowly,;0.0;4900;96
" We 're going to talk now , " said Riddle , still smiling broadly , and he pocketed Harry 's wand .;Harry;urgently,Potter,Tom,triumphantly,slowly,;0.0;4901;96
" How did Ginny get like this ? ";;Ginny;0.0;4904;96
" Well , that 's an interesting question , " said Riddle pleasantly . " And quite a long story . I suppose the real reason Ginny Weasley 's like this is because she opened her heart and spilled all her secrets to an invisible stranger . ";slowly;Weasley;0.183333333333;4906;96
" What are you talking about ? ";Harry;urgently,Potter,Tom,triumphantly,slowly,;0.0;4907;96
" The diary , " said Riddle .;;Harry,urgently,Potter,Tom,triumphantly,slowly;0.0;4909;96
Little Ginny 's been writing in it for months and months , telling me all her pitiful worries and woes - how her brothers tease her , how she had to come to school with secondhand robes and books , how - " Riddle 's eyes glinted " - how she did n't think famous , good , great Harry Potter would ever like her ... ";Potter;Harry,urgently,Tom,triumphantly,slowly,;0.3325;4911;96
" It 's very boring , having to listen to the silly little troubles of an eleven-year-old girl , " he went on . " But I was patient . I wrote back . I was sympathetic , I was kind . Ginny simply loved me . No one 's ever understood me like you,Tom ... I 'm so glad I 've got this diary to confide in ... It 's like having a friend I can carry around in my pocket ... ";;Harry,urgently,Potter,Tom,triumphantly,slowly;0.0390625;4914;96
" If I say it myself , Harry , I 've always been able to charm the people I needed . So Ginny poured out her soul to me , and her soul happened to be exactly what I wanted ... I grew stronger and stronger on a diet of her deepest fears , her darkest secrets . I grew powerful , far more powerful than little Miss Weasley . Powerful enough to start feeding Miss Weasley a few of my secrets , to start pouring a little of my soul back into her ... ";Harry;Ginny;0.129545454545;4917;96
" What d'you mean ? ";;Harry,urgently,Potter,Tom,triumphantly,slowly;-0.3125;4918;96
" Have n't you guessed yet , Harry Potter ? ";Harry;urgently,Potter,Tom,triumphantly,slowly,;0.0;4920;96
said Riddle softly . " Ginny Weasley opened the Chamber of Secrets . She strangled the school roosters and daubed threatening messages on the walls . She set the Serpent of Slytherin on four Mudbloods , and the Squib 's cat . ";;Weasley,Chamber;0.0;4921;96
" No , " Harry whispered .;Harry;urgently,Potter,Tom,triumphantly,slowly,;0.0;4922;96
" Yes , " said Riddle , calmly . " Of course , she did n't know what she was doing at first . It was very amusing . I wish you could have seen her new diary entries...far more interesting , they became ... Dear Tom , " he recited , watching Harry 's horrified face , ` I think I 'm losing my memory .;Harry;urgently,Potter,Tom,triumphantly,slowly,;0.433272727273;4923;96
I think I 'm the one attacking everyone , Tom ! ";Tom;Harry,urgently,Potter,triumphantly,slowly,;0.0;4931;96
" It took a very long time for stupid little Ginny to stop trusting her diary , " said Riddle . " But she finally became suspicious and tried to dispose of it . And that 's where you came in , Harry . You found it , and I could n't have been more delighted . Of all the people who could have picked it up , it was you , the very person I was most anxious to meet ... ";;Harry,urgently,Potter,Tom,triumphantly,slowly;0.0746875;4933;96
" And why did you want to meet me ? ";Harry;urgently,Potter,Tom,triumphantly,slowly,;0.0;4934;96
" Well , you see , Ginny told me all about you , Harry , " said Riddle . " Your whole fascinating history . ";;Ginny;0.45;4937;96
His eyes roved over the lightning scar on Harry 's forehead , and their expression grew hungrier . " I knew I must find out more about you , talk to you , meet you if I could . So I decided to show you my famous capture of that great oaf , Hagrid , to gain your trust - ";Harry;urgently,Potter,Tom,triumphantly,slowly,;0.6;4938;96
" Hagrid 's my friend , " said Harry , his voice now shaking . " And you framed him , did n't you ? I thought you made a mistake , but - ";Harry;urgently,Potter,Tom,triumphantly,slowly,;0.0;4939;96
" It was my word against Hagrid ' s , Harry . Well , you can imagine how it looked to old Armando Dippet . On the one hand , Tom Riddle , poor but brilliant , parentless but so brave , school prefect , model student ... on the other hand , big , blundering Hagrid , in trouble every other week , trying to raise werewolf cubs under his bed , sneaking off to the Forbidden Forest to wrestle trolls ... but I admit , even I was surprised how well the plan worked . I thought someone must realize that Hagrid could n't possibly be the Heir of Slytherin . It had taken me five whole years to find out everything I could about the Chamber of Secrets and discover the secret entrance ... as though Hagrid had the brains , or the power !;;Hagrid,Dippet;0.1025;4941;96
" Only the Transfiguration teacher , Dumbledore , seemed to think Hagrid was innocent . He persuaded Dippetto keep Hagrid and train him as gamekeeper . Yes , I think Dumbledore might have guessed...Dumbledore never seemed to like me as much as the other teachers did ... ";slowly;Hagrid,Dippet,Dumbledore;0.11875;4942;96
" I bet Dumbledore saw right through you , " said Harry , his teeth gritted .;Harry;bet;0.285714285714;4943;96
" Well , he certainly kept an annoyingly close watch on me after Hagrid was expelled , " said Riddle carelessly . " I knew it would n't be safe to open the Chamber again while I was still at school . But I was n't going to waste those long years I'd spent searching for it . I decided to leave behind a diary , preserving my sixteen-year-old self in its pages , so that one day , with luck , I would be able to lead another in my footsteps , and finish Salazar Slytherin 's noble work . ";;Hagrid,I'd,again,Salazar;0.135714285714;4944;96
" Well , you have n't finished it , " said Harry triumphantly . " No one 's died this time , not even the cat . In a few hours the Mandrake Draught will be ready and everyone who was Petrified will be all right again - ";triumphantly;Harry,urgently,Potter,Tom,slowly,;0.0952380952381;4945;96
" Have n't I already told you , " said Riddle quietly , " that killing Mudbloods does n't matter to me anymore ? For many months now , my new target has been - you . ";;Mudbloods;0.318181818182;4946;96
" Imagine how angry I was when the next time my diary was opened , it was Ginny who was writing to me , not you . She saw you with the diary , you see , and panicked . What if you found out how to work it , and I repeated all her secrets to you ? What if , even worse , I told you who'd been strangling roosters ? So the foolish little brat waited until your dormitory was deserted and stole it back . But I knew what I must do . It was clear to me that you were on the trail of Slytherin 's heir . From everything Ginny had told me about you , I knew you would go to any lengths to solve the mystery - particularly if one of your best friends was attacked . And Ginny had told me the whole school was buzzing because you could speak Parseltongue ...;Harry;ever,Ginny,Parseltongue;0.0265625;4948;96
" So I made Ginny write her own farewell on the wall and come down here to wait . She struggled and cried and became very boring . But there is n't much life left in her ... She put too much into the diary , into me . Enough to let me leave its pages at last ... I have been waiting for you to appear since we arrived here . I knew you'd come . I have many questions for you , Harry Potter . ";;Ginny;-0.0172839506173;4949;96
" Like what ? ";Harry;urgently,Potter,Tom,triumphantly,slowly,;0.0;4950;96
" Well , " said Riddle , smiling pleasantly , " how is it that you - a skinny boy with no extraordinary magical talent - managed to defeat the greatest wizard of all time ? How did you escape with nothing but a scar , while Lord Voldemort 's powers were destroyed ? ";;Harry,urgently,Potter,Tom,triumphantly,slowly;0.611111111111;4952;96

" You see ? ";;Harry,urgently,Potter,Tom,triumphantly,slowly;0.0;4961;96

I , in whose veins runs the blood of Salazar Slytherin himself , through my mother 's side ? I , keep the name of a foul , common Muggle , who abandoned me even before I was born , just because he found out his wife was a witch ?

" Not what ? ";;Harry,urgently,Potter,Tom,triumphantly,slowly;0.0;4966;96
" Not the greatest sorcerer in the world , " said Harry , breathing fast . " Sorry to disappoint you and all that , but the greatest wizard in the world is Albus Dumbledore . Everyone says so . Even when you were strong , you did n't dare try and take over at Hogwarts . Dumbledore saw through you when you were at school and he still frightens you now , wherever you 're hiding these days - ";Harry;Dumbledore;0.426666666667;4968;96

" That 's a phoenix . ";Harry;Fawkes;0.0;4988;97
" Fawkes ? ";Harry;Fawkes;0.0;4990;97

" This is what Dumbledore sends his defender ! A songbird and an old hat ! Do you feel brave , Harry Potter ? Do you feel safe now ? ";Harry;Dumbledore;0.475;4997;97
" To business , Harry , " said Riddle , still smiling broadly . " Twice - in your past , in my future - we have met . And twice I failed to kill you . How did you survive ? Tell me everything . The longer you talk , " he added softly , " the longer you stay alive . ";Harry;Fawkes;-0.1625;5000;97
" No one knows why you lost your powers when you attacked me , " said Harry abruptly . " I do n't know myself . But I know why you could n't kill me . Because my mother died to save me . My common Muggle-born mother , " he added , shaking with suppressed rage . " She stopped you killing me . And I 've seen the real you , I saw you last year . You 're a wreck . You 're barely alive . That 's where all your power got you . You 're in hiding . You 're ugly , you 're foul - ";Harry;Fawkes;-0.16;5005;97
Then he forced it into an awful smile . " So . Your mother died to save you . Yes , that 's a powerful countercharm . I can see now...there is nothing special about you , after all . I wondered , you see . There are strange likenesses between us , after all . Even you must have noticed . Both half-bloods , orphans , raised by Muggles . Probably the only two Parselmouths to come to Hogwarts since the great Slytherin himself We even look something alike...but after all , it was merely a lucky chance that saved you from me . That 's all I wanted to know . ";Harry;Fawkes;0.0822751322751;5007;97
