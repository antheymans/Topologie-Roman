_SCRIMGEOUR
"These are dark times, there is no denying. Our world has perhaps faced no greater threat than it does today. But I say this to our citizenry: we, ever your servants, continue to defend your liberty and repel the forces that would seek to take it from you. Your Ministry remains strong..."
CAMERA FAVORS a pair of wizards, YAXLEY and PIU HICKNESSE, who turn away as we PULL OUT of th HOTOGRAPH and SAIL once more THROUGH the turning pages he headlines growing grimmer, the faces more HAUNTED ntil, finally, we emerge from the Prophet and find it i he hands of...

3 INT. GRANGER HOME - HERMIONE'S BEDROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

(RAINING .. HERMIONE. She stares stoically at a LURID HEADLINE - UGGLE FAMILY MURDERED -- VIOLENCE SPREADS.
_MRS. GRANGER (O.S.)
"Hermione. Your tea is ready, dear."
Hermione glances through the doorway to the stair eyond. Her MOTHER'S SHADOW clings to the wall rembling within another SHADOW, that of a WIND-TOSSE REE. It is strangely beautiful and Hermione seem ransfixed...
_HERMIONE
"Coming, Mum."
(CONTINUED)

Her mother's SHADOW withdraws, leaving only the tremblin ree. Hermione glances once more at the Prophet' roubling headline, then slips it into a TINY BEADED BAG.

4 INT. PARLOR - LATE AFTERNOON (MOMENTS LATER, RAINING)

As Hermione descends the stairs, MRS. GRANGER exits th itchen with a teapot.
_MRS. GRANGER
"Don't you look lovely. All packed?"
Hermione nods and watches her mother set the teapot o he table in front of the television. Just then, MR RANGER steps out holding a biscuit tin.
_MR. GRANGER
"Are you sure these biscuits are sugar-free?"
_MRS. GRANGER
"Quite sure, dear. See the big bold letters that say `Sugar Free'? Dead giveaway."
_MR. GRANGER
"Mm. Yes."
(passing Hermione)
"Hello, kitten. Don't you look lovely."
Hermione smiles wanly as her father gives her a peck o he head, then joins her mother on the sofa opposite th elevision. An AUSTRALIAN WILDLIFE PROGRAM PLAYS.
_TELEVISION (V.O.)
 ... the bandicoot has small
"pointed ears and a long snout from which it emits a distinctive trumpet sound when agitated..."
_MRS. GRANGER
"Darling, don't be suspicious the biscuits taste so good, be grateful the company's so clever..."
Hermione looks away from the screen, studies her mothe nd father. Slowly, she reaches into the tiny bag an ithdraws her wand. Taking two steps forward, she point t toward the back of their heads. Hand trembling, sh PEAKS, her VOICE barely a WHISPER CONTINUED)


4 CONTINUED:

_HERMIONE
"Obliviate."
Mrs. Granger's face goes briefly slack and she reache ut, as if to break a fall, then, slowly, her hand drops oming to rest upon her husband's. He blinks once lankly, and then... enfolds her fingers in his ermione lowers her arm and, eyes stinging with tears atches the PHOTOGRAPHS placed about the room begin t HANGE. One by one, Hermione DISAPPEARS from each.
_HERMIONE
"Goodbye."

5 EXT. STREET - LATE AFTERNOON (MOMENTS LATER, RAINING)

Clutching the beaded bag, Hermione moves down th indswept street into the dying light. We BOOM UP TO th ky, HOLD briefly, then BOOM DOWN TO...

6 EXT. FRONT YARD (THE BURROW) - DUSK

... RON, staring at the stars. He drops his gaze to th ouse, studies GINNY and MRS. WEASLEY, aglow in the ligh f the kitchen, watching them with affection, as i ommitting them to memory. His gaze shifts to th djacent SHED. Inside, ARTHUR WEASLEY is bent over hi orkbench.

7 INT. SHED - DUSK (MOMENTS LATER)

Mr. Weasley fiddles with a SMALL RADIO. Another half ozen -- in various stages of repair -- stand in a lin efore him.
_RON
"What are those?"
Mr. Weasley turns, sees Ron standing in the doorway.
_ARTHUR WEASLEY
"Close the door."
Ron eases inside and steps to the workbench. Mr. Weasle urns the knob on the radio before him. STATIC spit orth, then a VOICE comes clear CONTINUED)


7 CONTINUED:

_RADIO (V.O.)
 ... comes to us this evening from
"the north of England, where a wizard family by the name of Westinburgh were found dead in their cellar. While not a member of the Order, Mr. Westinburgh and his wife had, on numerous occasions, provided shelter for its members..."
Arthur switches off the radio. Gestures to the others.
_ARTHUR WEASLEY
"These are for the Order. So many are on the run now, it helps them to stay connected with the rest of us. Know they're not alone..."
Ron studies his father's weary face as the older ma tares at his handiwork. Places his hand upon hi houlder.
_RON
"C'mon. Mum's got dinner ready."
Arthur nods, pushes away from the bench and heads out th oor. Ron lingers briefly, studying the radio, the ollows his father into the night. We FADE. The TITL ARD appears... and we --
_DISSOLVE TO:

8 EXT. NIGHT SKY

A scarlet moon. A speck -- a nightbird, or a bat - ramed in the moon's surface, approaches rapidly, then - HOOSH! -- passes beneath. Far below, a sea of treetop hift eerily.

9 EXT. MALFOY MANOR - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER)

We PLUMMET THROUGH the shifting trees TO a narrow moonli ane. A SHADOW ripples across the ground like a kit ade of water. A BOOT touches down upon the gravele ane, then another. A cape flutters slowly down upon th houlders of a wizard, lank hair splayed across his wind lown collar. His head turns. Moonlight strikes hi ale face. SNAPE oving. Up a wide drive, to a pair of wrought iro ates. Beyond, a large manor that has seen better days  RUSTLING sounds. Snape wheels, draws his wand CONTINUED)


9 CONTINUED:

A PEACOCK, white as a ghost, emerges from the yew. Snap yes it warily, then lifts his hand. The iron gates tur o smoke.

10 INT. MALFOY MANOR - ENTRYWAY - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER) 10

Fractured in the prism of a diamond-paned window, Snap pproaches. The front door glides open. As he enters ark eyes in torch-lit portraits track him from above.

11 INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER)

A door looms at the end of a hallway. Reaching it, Snap esitates for a heartbeat, then enters.

12 INT. DRAWING ROOM - SAME TIME - NIGHT

Two dozen figures sit silently at a large ornate table lluminated by the flickering light of a fireplace nape studies the scene, then his eyes rise. Revolvin lowly near the ceiling, as if suspended by an invisibl ope, is an unconscious WOMAN (CHARITY BURBAGE).
_VOLDEMORT
"Severus. I was beginning to worry you'd lost your way. Come. I've saved you a seat."
VOLDEMORT grins, silhouetted against the fire, an estures to the seat nearest his own. All eyes follo nape, all except DRACO MALFOY, who nervously stares a he body above and a haggard LUCIUS MALFOY, who merel tares vaguely at his wand while his wife NARCISSA look traight ahead.
_VOLDEMORT
"You know our hosts, of course, Severus. Narcissa in particular has been most hospitable. Lucius, on the other hand, is, I fear, burdened by my presence. Are you, Lucius?"
_LUCIUS
"My lord?"
_VOLDEMORT
"Are you burdened?"
_NARCISSA MALFOY
"My lord is always welcome here."
(CONTINUED)


12 CONTINUED:

Voldemort smiles, his eyes shifting to Snape, who watche he great snake NAGINI as she slopes slowly over the fee f those present, unnerving all.
_VOLDEMORT
"You bring news I trust, Severus?"
_SNAPE
"It will happen Saturday next. At nightfall."
_VOLDEMORT
"And this information comes --"
_SNAPE
"-- from the source we discussed."
Yaxley, the wizard seen at the Ministry, leans into th lickering light from the opposite end of the table.
_YAXLEY
"I have heard differently, my lord. Dawlish, the Auror, let slip that the Potter boy will not be moved until the thirtieth of this month, the night before he turns seventeen."
_SNAPE
"This is a false trail. The Auror Office no longer plays any part in the protection of Harry Potter. Those closest to him believe we have infiltrated the Ministry."
_SQUAT MAN
"Well, they've got that right, then, `aven't they?"
As the Squat Man cackles wheezily, others join in oldemort raises a hand. All goes silent.
_VOLDEMORT
"Pius, what say you?"
PIUS THICKNESSE looks up, his gaze placid.
_THICKNESSE
"One hears many things, my lord. Whether the truth is among them is not clear."
(CONTINUED)


12 CONTINUED: (2)

_VOLDEMORT
"Spoken like a true politician. You will, I think, prove most useful, Pius. Where will he be taken? The boy?"
_SNAPE
"To a safehouse. Likely the home of someone in the Order. I'm told it has been given every manner of protection possible. Once there, it will be impractical to attack him. We may have compromised the Ministry, but there are those who remain loyal to him. As long as the Ministry stands, his allies within will have the means at their disposal to insure his safety."
_BELLATRIX
"My lord, if I might, I'd like to volunteer myself for this task. I'd like to kill the boy."
Just then a WAIL rises from the floorboards. Voldemort' yes flash briefly with RED.
_VOLDEMORT
"Wormtail! Have I not spoken to you about keeping our guest quiet?"
_WORMTAIL
"Yes, m-my lord. Right away, my lord."
As WORMTAIL scrambles up, Voldemort returns his gaze t ELLATRIX.
_VOLDEMORT
"As inspiring as I find your bloodlust, Bellatrix, I must be the one to kill Harry Potter. But I face an unfortunate complication. It has recently come to my attention that my wand and Potter's share the same core. They are, in some ways, twins. We can wound but not fatally harm one another. Which means, if I am to kill him... I will have to do it with another's wand."
The others at the table stir nervously. Bellatri tiffens. Voldemort's narrow eyes rake the room CONTINUED)

7A.


12 CONTINUED: (3)

_VOLDEMORT
"Come now. Surely one of you would like the honor? What about... you, Lucius?"
Lucius peers up, sallow and beaten CONTINUED)


12 CONTINUED: (4)

_VOLDEMORT
"I require your wand."
Lucius sits mute, paralyzed by the request, scanning th aces of the others, who avoid his gaze, all but Snape ho regards him with naked contempt and Draco, whose eye eet his briefly, then glance away. Finally Narcissa' ingers lightly graze his wrist, summoning him back t he moment. Turning, he watches as, almos mperceptibly, she nods. Lowering his head, he ROLLS hi and slowly across the table, where it stops a oldemort's skeletal hand. Voldemort holds the wand t he light.
_VOLDEMORT
"Do I detect elm?"
_LUCIUS
"Yes, my lord."
_VOLDEMORT
"And the core?"
_LUCIUS
"Dragon -- dragon heartstring."
Voldemort nods, getting a feel for the wand's heft, the is eyes shift, catch Lucius staring at the WAND on th able -- Voldemort's own.
_VOLDEMORT
"My wand? You can't possibly think I would give you my wand."
Lucius' eyes meet Voldemort's. For a moment he i peechless. Finally his chin drops.
_LUCIUS
"No, my lord."
Voldemort studies Lucius' bowed head, then returns hi ttention to the wand in his hand. Raising it, he point t at the body above. With a FLICK, the body awakens WITCHING against its invisible bonds.
_VOLDEMORT
"For those of you who do not know, we are joined tonight by Miss Charity Burbage who until recently taught at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Her specialty was Muggle studies. It is Miss Burbage's belief that Muggles are not so different from us."
(MORE CONTINUED)

8A.


12 CONTINUED: (5)

_VOLDEMORT (CONT'D)
"She would, given her way, have us mate with them. To her, the mixture of magical and Muggle blood is not an abomination but something to be encouraged. I, of course, take a contrary view. But we're all civilized here. All adults. We can agree to disagree."
Charity's tear-streaked face revolves once more to fac nape, her voice hoarse with fear.
_CHARITY
"Severus, please. We're friends..."
Snape's face remains impassive. Voldemort's eyes narro o scarlet slits... his voice HISSES. Draco watches  eardrop strike the table...
_VOLDEMORT
"Avada Kedavra!"
(CONTINUED)


12 CONTINUED: (6)

GREEN LIGHT envelops the room. Charity plummets to th able, body still. Voldemort ponders the wand atisfied.
_VOLDEMORT
"Nagini... Dinner."

13 EXT. PRIVET DRIVE - DUSK

A blood-red sky hangs over the neighborhood.

14 INT. DURSLEY HOUSE - HARRY'S BEDROOM - SAME TIME - DUSK

An EYE shimmers in a SHARD of SILVERED GLASS. HARR OTTER'S eye. He tosses the mirror inside a LUMP UCKSACK, than adds a LOCKET, a Daily Prophet CLIPPIN ntitled "Dumbledore Remembered" (above which is  HOTOGRAPH of its author, ELPHIAS DOGE with DUMBLEDORE nd a NOTEBOOK filled with scribblings on Horcruxes and n large block letters, the initials "R.A.B." He give he rucksack a shake, then glances about to see if he' orgotten anything. The room looks as if it's bee ottled up and shaken. Dresser drawers turned out, floo overed in detritus.
_UNCLE VERNON (O.S.)
"Come now, Dudley. Hurry up!"
Harry steps to the window, peers to the driveway below NCLE VERNON rolls a large STEAMER TRUNK towards his car ollowed by DUDLEY, who tugs an equally large TRUNK o is own. Harry speaks to HEDWIG.
_HARRY
"Time for the teary farewell."

15 INT. STAIRWELL/FRONT HALLWAY - DUSK (MOMENTS LATER)

Harry drops down the stairs. The house feels barren esolate. Aunt Petunia stands at the mouth of th itchen, looking around. Seeing her, Harry comes to  top.
_AUNT PETUNIA
"I've lived in this house twenty years. And now -- in a single night -- I'm expected to leave."
_HARRY
"They'll torture you. Even Dudley. If they think you know where I'm going, they'll stop at noth--"
(CONTINUED)
"10."

15 CONTINUED:

_AUNT PETUNIA
"You think I don't know that? You think I don't know what they're capable of?"
Her eyes pierce Harry's.
_AUNT PETUNIA
"You didn't just lose a mother that night in Godric's Hollow, you know. I lost a sister."
Harry studies her, taken aback.
_HARRY
"Do you have any? Magic?"
_AUNT PETUNIA
"What a cruel thing to ask."

16 EXT. PRIVET DRIVE - DUSK (MOMENTS LATER)

Uncle Vernon tests the strap binding the trunks to  mall TRAILER hitched to the back of the Dursley car hen squints awkwardly at Harry.
_UNCLE VERNON
"Well, this is goodbye then, boy."
Harry, standing by the front door, nods, eyes Petunia ho sits in the front passenger seat, a ghost behind th lass.
_DUDLEY
"I don't understand. Isn't he coming with us?"
_UNCLE VERNON
"Who?"
_DUDLEY
"Harry."
_UNCLE VERNON
"Absolutely not."
_DUDLEY
"Why?"
_UNCLE VERNON
"Well, because -- he doesn't want to, do you, boy?"
(CONTINUED)


16 CONTINUED:

_HARRY
"Absolutely not. Besides, I'm just a waste of space. Isn't that right, Vernon?"
Uncle Vernon stares hard at Harry.
_UNCLE VERNON
"Come on, Dudley, we're off."
Uncle Vernon starts for the car. Dudley hesitates, the rosses the lawn to Harry, extends his hand.
_DUDLEY
"I don't think you're a waste of space."
_HARRY
"Well... thanks."
Harry grips Dudley's hand, then watches his cousin tur nd lope back across the lawn.
_HARRY
(under his breath)
"See you, Big D."

17 INT. DURSLEY HOUSE - BOTTOM FLOOR - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER)

Harry stands, rucksack over his shoulder, Hedwig's cag n hand. Somewhere, nearby, a CLOCK TICKS. Otherwise ll is still. Utterly quiet. He glances about th ouse, full of shadows, like ghosts. His eyes burn wit itterness.
_HARRY
"Good riddance."
His eyes shift. The last rays of sunlight lay, like  tain, upon a SMALL CUPBOARD DOOR below the stairs. H ets the rucksack slip from his shoulder. Sets down th age.

18 INT. CUPBOARD UNDERNEATH THE STAIRS - SAME TIME - NIGHT

The door opens. Harry's face appears. Motes of dus ance before his eyes. He peers into the shadows, int is past. A DEAD SPIDER hangs within an ancient web.  EGIMENT of TOY SOLDIERS -- broken and draped with dus - line a listing shelf. As the SUN withdraws from th allway, a tremor passes through Harry's face and then.. CONTINUED)


18 CONTINUED:

A TREMENDOUS ROAR murders the silence, the roar of  OTOR BIKE. Harry straightens -- half-believing he' reamed it into existence -- and STRIKES his head on th ow door frame.

19 INT. HALLWAY/KITCHEN - SAME TIME - NIGHT

Harry pelts down the dark hall as OPAQUE SHAPES race pas he windows. He trips past Hedwig's cage, sending i OBBLING and flings open the front door.

Others emerge from the shadows: FRED EORGE, BILL, FLEUR, TONKS, LUPIN, ARTHUR WEASLEY, MAD YE MOODY, KINGSLEY SHACKLEBOLT and a small, dirty angdog man, MUNDUNGUS FLETCHER. Lastly, HAGRI ismounts a MOTORBIKE, strips a pair of fly-specke oggles from his face and yanks a SMALL TWITTERING BIR rom his beard.
_HAGRID
"All righ', `arry? Yeh look fit."
_MAD-EYE
"Yeah, he's ruddy gorgeous. What say we get undercover before someone murders him."

21 INT. SITTING ROOM/KITCHEN - NIGHT

Everyone spills down the hallway into the sitting room.
_HARRY
"I thought you were looking after the Prime Minister, Kingsley."
_SHACKLEBOLT
"You're more important."

"Wasn't always this handsome."

_GEORGE
"Dead ugly."
_BILL

"True enough. Owe it all to a werewolf by name of Greyback. Hope to repay the favor one day."
_FLEUR
(a kiss to the cheek)
"You are still beautiful to me, William."
_LUPIN
"Just remember, Fleur, once you're married: Bill takes his steaks on the raw side now."
_TONKS
"My husband, the joker. By the way, wait until you hear the news! Remus and I are --"
_MAD-EYE
"All right, all right! You'll all have time for a cozy catch-up later! We've got to get the hell out of here and soon!"
Moody drops some SACKS at his feet. Turns to Harry.
_MAD-EYE
"Potter, you're underage, which means you've still got the Trace on you."
_HARRY
"The Trace?"
_MAD-EYE
"You sneeze and the Ministry will know who wipes your nose. Point is, we have to use those means of transport the Trace can't detect: brooms, thestrals and the like. We'll go in pairs. That way if anyone's out there waiting for us -- and I reckon there will be -- they won't know which Harry Potter is the real one."
_HARRY
"The real one...?"
(CONTINUED)


21 CONTINUED: (2)

Moody draws a FLASK from his cloak.
_MAD-EYE
"I believe you're familiar with this particular brew."
_HARRY
"No! Absolutely not!"
_HERMIONE
(a sigh)
"I told you he'd take it well."
_HARRY
"If you think I'm going to let people risk their lives for me --"
_RON
"Never done that before, have we?"
_HARRY
"This is different. Taking that. Becoming me -- no."
_FRED
"Well, none of us really fancy it, mate."
_GEORGE
"Yeah, imagine if something went wrong and we were stuck as scrawny, specky gits forever."
_MAD-EYE
"Everyone here's of age, Potter, and they've all agreed to take the risk."
_MUNDUNGUS
"Technically, I've been coerced."
(turning to Harry and
 extending his hand)
"Mundungus Fletcher, Mr. Potter. I've always been a huge admirer."
_MAD-EYE
"Nip it, Mundungus! All right, Granger, as discussed."
Hermione grabs a tuft of Harry's hair -- yanks.

Moody holds out the flask, un-stoppered now. The potio nside begins to spit forth smoke. He hands it t eorge.
_MAD-EYE
"For those of you who haven't taken Polyjuice Potion before, fair warning. It tastes like goblin piss."
_FRED
"Have a lot of experience with that, do you, Mad-Eye?"
Moody's eye rotates menacingly onto Fred.
_FRED
"Just trying to defuse the tension."
Fred takes the flask from George, followed by Ron ermione, Fleur and a less than overjoyed Mundungus. H cowls as the potion trickles past his lips and second ater, his features -- like those of the others -- begi o bubble like hot wax. As the transformation completes even Harry Potters stand in the tiny kitchen.
_FRED/GEORGE
"Wow -- we're identical!"
_MAD-EYE
"Not yet you aren't."
Moody pulls the ties on the SACKS and pulls out SEVE DENTICAL OUTFITS.
_GEORGE
"Don't have something a bit more sporty, do you?"
_FRED
"Yes, don't fancy this color at all."
_MAD-EYE
"Fancy this: You're not you, so shut it and strip."
(to Harry)
"You'll need to change too, Potter."
Harry, a bit self-consciously, begins to strip down. Th thers, meanwhile, appear unconcerned to be exposin arry's body.

_MAD-EYE
"Blimey. I almost forgot."
Mad-Eye rummages in his pocket, pulls out a fistful o YE-GLASSES.
_MAD-EYE
"Right then. We'll be pairing off. Each Potter will have a protector. As for you, Harry..."
_ALL
"Yes?"
_MAD-EYE
"The real Harry! Where the devil are you, anyway?"
_HARRY
"Here."
Moody's eye rotates onto the real Harry.
_MAD-EYE
"You'll ride with Hagrid."
_HAGRID
"Brought yeh here sixteen years ago when you were barely bigger than a Bowtruckle. Seems only righ' I should be the one ter take yeh away."
_MAD-EYE
"Yeah, it's all very touching. Let's go."
As they file out, grabs his rucksack and ponders Hedwi n her cage. He snaps open the wire door and sh lutters out, swoops down the hallway and soars out th pen door. Harry glances once more down the hall, at th upboard under the stairs, then exits. He HOLD O edwig's empty cage.

_HARRY
"Hagrid! We've got to help the others!"
_HAGRID
"Can't do it, `arry. My job's ter get you where we're goin' safe `n sound -- Mad-Eye's orders!"
Before Harry can reply, FOUR DEATH EATERS jet out of th arkness, robes snapping in the wind. As one, thei ands rise.

Sparks skitter off the tunnel and shower down as th idecar rides up into the air repeatedly, then slams dow nto the roadway. Harry glances back, sees the Deat aters closing when LIGHT FILLS THE TUNNEL and HAGRI OARS. Turning back, Harry sees a HUGE LORRY rushin owards them.

Suddenly, several yards away, a BLUE LIGHT burns in th arkness. Harry and Ginny rush towards it just as Lupi aterializes, cradling an unconscious "Harry," clothe orn, head awash in BLOOD. Harry takes in the surrea ableau, then watches "himself" transform into George ho bears the true damage. Ginny's hands fly to he ace.
_GINNY
"Oh my God! George!"
_LUPIN
"The house! Quickly!"

29 INT. WEASLEY HOUSE - SITTING ROOM - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER)

Lupin and Harry drop George onto the sofa, where his hea olls into the lamplight, the blood more shocking here olly Weasley screams. George's ear is gone.
_MRS. WEASLEY
"My boy! My darling boy! What've they done to you?!"
Harry looks on miserably -- anger and guilt clashin ithin him -- when Lupin grabs a fistful of his shirt an urls him against the wall.
_GINNY
"Remus! What're you doing!"
_LUPIN
"What creature sat in the corner the first time that Harry Potter visited my office at Hogwarts!"
_HARRY
"Are you mad...?"
(CONTINUED)


29 CONTINUED:

_LUPIN
"WHAT CREATURE!"
_HARRY
"A grindylow!"
Lupin releases Harry, turns back to the others.
_LUPIN
"We've been betrayed. Voldemort knew you were being moved tonight. I had to make sure you weren't an imposter."
_HARRY
"Who did this to him?"
_LUPIN
"Snape."
(nodding to George)
"He'll be fine, Molly. But that's Dark Magic. The damage is done."
She simply nods, weeping, dabbing at George's face.  lue glow glimmers against the window, where Hagri tands.
_HAGRID
"Someone else is back."

30 EXT. YARD (THE BURROW) - NIGHT (SECONDS LATER) 30

Hermione and Kingsley stand together, looking shaken. A he others rush forward, Kingsley points his wand a upin.
_SHACKLEBOLT
"The last words Albus Dumbledore spoke to the pair of us?"
_LUPIN
 `Harry is the best hope we have.
"Trust him.'"
Shacklebolt lowers his wand, wheels on Harry.
_SHACKLEBOLT
"What gave you away?"
_HARRY
"Hedwig -- I think. She was trying to protect me --"
(CONTINUED)


30 CONTINUED: 30

Just then, the yard glows with BLUE LIGHT and one pai fter another materialize: Fred & Mr. Weasley, Bill  leur, Ron & Tonks. Ron is still "Harry," but Hermion oesn't hesitate, enveloping him in a fierce hug. As h ransforms back into his own battle-weary self, he look ildly abashed to be in such close proximity to Hermione.
_RON
"Hey ya -- Well... thanks."
_TONKS
"Deserves that. Brilliant, he was. Wouldn't be standing here without him."
_HERMIONE
"Really?"
_RON
(breaking free of
 her)
"Always the tone of surprise."
_ARTHUR WEASLEY
"Are we the last? Where's George?"
Suddenly... silence. Mr. Weasley eyes all, turns t upin.
_ARTHUR WEASLEY
"Remus. Where's my son?"

31 INT. WEASLEY HOUSE - SITTING ROOM - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER)

Arthur Weasley, trailed by the others, stops dead. Moll ooks up, her face saying it all. Fred comes up on hi ather's shoulder, eyes stinging with tears as he see is brother. As if sensing them, George stirs.
_FRED
"How do you feel, Georgie?"
_GEORGE
"Saint-like."
_FRED
"Come again?"
George opens his eyes, lifts a blood-crusted finger, an oints to the dark cavity in the side of his skull.
_GEORGE
"Saint-like... You see, I'm holy. Holey, Fred, geddit?"
(CONTINUED)


31 CONTINUED:

_FRED
"With the whole wide world of ear- related humor at your disposal, you go for holey? Pathetic."
_GEORGE
"Reckon I'm still better-looking than you. Better-looking than Bill, that's for sure."
Bill doesn't smile. Next to him, Fleur looks equall rim.
_BILL
"Mad-Eye's dead."
The room goes still.
_BILL
"Mundungus took one look at Voldemort and Disapparated."
_LUPIN
"Mad-Eye reckoned You-Know-Who would expect the real Harry to be with the most skilled Auror. He knew he'd be in the most danger."
_ARTHUR WEASLEY
"It doesn't explain how they knew we were moving Harry tonight."
The room grows quiet. Eyes shift.
_HAGRID
"Wha'? One of us? Tha's mad. I'd wager me life it wasn' none of you lot. An' if it was me I'd kno', wouldn' I? Talk in me sleep on occasion, I'll admit, but there's only Fang aroun' ter hear an' mostly it's gibberish an' besides I'd cut me tongue out `fore `d betray `arry e'en in me dreams --"
Hagrid stops, blinking miserably. Suddenly, all smile.
_HAGRID
"Wha's so funny!"
_HARRY
"I trust you with my life, Hagrid. I trust everyone in this room. Understood?"
(CONTINUED)

 `Ear, `ear.
Fred nods approvingly to his brother.
_FRED
"Better."


33 INT. RON'S ROOM - NIGHT (LATER)

Shadows cling to the ceiling. Harry tosses fitfully omething bedeviling his sleep. Suddenly, his SCA ONTRACTS. He GRIMACES.
_VOLDEMORT (V.O.)
"You lied to me, Ollivander!"

34 INT. MALFOY MANOR - CELLAR - NIGHT

At the bottom of a run of rotting wooden stairs, Wormtai rops up an emaciated OLLIVANDER CONTINUED)

25A.


34 CONTINUED:

In the cracked surface of a TALL MIRROR, we see Voldemor eflected at the top of the stairs -- an angr ilhouette.
_OLLIVANDER
"No! No! I believed a different wand would work, I swear!"
_VOLDEMONT
"Then explain this!"
Voldemort extends his skeletal fingers. Lucius Malfoy' and lies shattered upon his ghostly skin.
_OLLIVANDER
"But it makes no sense..."
_VOLDEMORT
"Perhaps our friend's loyalties lie elsewhere, Wormtail."
(CONTINUED)


34 CONTINUED: (2)

_OLLIVANDER
"No! There must be a way! I'll think of something else!"
_VOLDEMONT
"I hope so, Ollivander, for your sake. I won't be so forgiving next time..."

35 INT. RON'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION - NIGHT

Harry awakens with a GASP, eyes flashing in the darkness e eyes the shadows above him, then looks down at hi and where his wand glimmers in the moonlight.

35A INT. STAIRCASE - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER) 35A

Rucksack slung over his shoulder, Harry picks his wa oftly down the spiraling steps, past silent doorways lipping in and out of shadow.

35B EXT. YARD - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER) 35B

Harry emerges into the night, shifting the rucksack as h yes the reeds shifting eerily in the darkness.
_RON (O.S.)
"Going somewhere?"
Harry stiffens, turns to meet Ron's accusatory gaze, the ontinues on.
_HARRY
"No one else is going to die. Not for me."
_RON
"For you? You think Madeye died for you? You think George took that curse for you? You may be the Chosen One, mate, but this is a whole lot bigger than that."
Harry stares at Ron. The air is tense.
_HARRY
"Come with me. Now."
_RON
"And leave Hermione? Are you mad? We wouldn't last two days without her."
(MORE CONTINUED)
"26A."

35B CONTINUED: 35B

_RON (CONT'D)
(glancing around)
"Don't tell her I said that."
(back to Harry)
"Besides, you've still got the Trace on you. And there's the wedding..."
_HARRY
"Wedding?"
_RON
"Bill and Fleur. Mum's been planning it for months. Only thing that's kept her sane, I reckon. She'll kill me if I miss it. Kill you too. Rather go face to face with You-Know-Who if I'm honest."
Ron tries a smile, but Harry looks foul.
_HARRY
"I don't care about a bloody wedding -- no matter whose it is. I have to start searching for the Horcruxes. It's the only chance we have to beat him. And the longer we wait the stronger he gets."
Ron just stares at Harry, calm, poised.
_RON
"Tonight's not the night, mate. You'd only be doing him a favor."
Harry stares at Ron -- incensed by his cool demeanor an ommon sense. Finally, he turns away, tosses th ucksack in frustration. For a moment they stand lik his, Harry's back to Ron. Silent. Finally Ron speaks.
_RON
"Do you think he knows?"
Harry turns his head halfway, but doesn't speak.
_RON
"I mean, they're bits of his soul, the Horcruxes. Bits of him. When Dumbledore destroyed the ring and you destroyed Tom Riddle's diary all those years ago -- he must've felt something right?"
Harry ponders this, but remains silent CONTINUED)
"26B."

35B CONTINUED: (2) 35B

_RON
"What I'm saying is, if we do this thing right, if we find the Horcruxes and begin to destroy them one by one..."
Harry waits.
_RON
"Won't he know he's being hunted?"
Still Harry says nothing. Silence descends once more hen:
_ARTHUR WEASLEY (O.S.)
"All together now!"

36 EXT. WEASLEY HOUSE - ORCHARD - MORNING

Bird's-eye view: An ENORMOUS CIRCLE of SILK lies fla pon the ground. As Hagrid looks on, Arthur, Bill, Ro nd Fred stand on its periphery, wands poised.
_ARTHUR WEASLEY
"One. Two. Three!"
The silk rises, pitching itself into a perfect weddin arquee, trembling wondrously in the morning breeze.. hen collapses.

37 INT. KITCHEN - MORNING (SECONDS LATER)

The DAILY PROPHET lies in f.g., HEADLINE SCREAMING:
"DUMBLEDORE'S DARK SECRETS." We HEAR FOOTSTEPS descend
the stairs... then Harry's blurry figure steps INTO FOCU nd takes the paper for a closer inspection ITA SKEETER grins up at him, holding a BOOK entitled Th ife and Lies of Albus Dumbledore. A bit further down nother headline: "Think You Know Dumbledore? Thin gain!"
_GINNY (O.S.)
"Were you going to tell me?"
Harry turns, finds Ginny in the doorway in a beautifu ress.
_HARRY
"Yes."
(CONTINUED)


37 CONTINUED:

_GINNY
"And Ron and Hermione. They'll not be going back to Hogwarts either?"
Harry stares at her. She looks excruciatingly beautifu n the light streaming through the window.
_GINNY
"I see."
_HARRY
"Dumbledore didn't want anyone to know what it is we're doing. If I tell you, I'd be betraying him."
_GINNY
"Zip me up, will you."
She turns. The dress is open to the small of her back arry steps forward and takes the zipper. As the panel lose, concealing her skin, his fingers linger at th op, lightly brushing the nape of her neck. They stan ike this, utterly still, the moment fraught.
_GINNY
"Seems silly, doesn't it? A wedding. Given everything that's going on."
_HARRY
"Maybe that's the best reason to have it. Because of everything that's going on."
Her chin turns, coming into profile, her face very close hen she folds into him and they are kissing. Long eep eorge wanders in brushing his teeth, pours himself a cu f tea and, sticking the toothbrush in his ear-hole eans back against the stove for a sip. Ginny -- sensin omething -- opens her eyes and JUMPS. Harry wheels eorge winks, tips his cup in their direction.
_GEORGE
"Morning."

38 EXT. ORCHARD - SAME TIME - MORNING

Arthur stands looking at the marquee from his POV erfect.
_ARTHUR WEASLEY
"How's it look on your end, boys?"
(CONTINUED)


38 CONTINUED:

Ron and Fred look: bent, mangled.
_FRED
"Brilliant!"
Just then, the silk snaps and the trees in th urrounding orchard shiver in a rush of wind. Everyon teps clear of the marquee and watches a TALL WIZARD wit RIZZLED HAIR and SCARRED CHEEK materialize. RUFU CRIMGEOUR.
_GEORGE
"Bloody hell, what's the Minister of Magic doing here?"
_RON
"Dunno. But something tells me he didn't come to give away the bride."

39 INT. WEASLEY HOUSE - SITTING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Harry enters, trailed by Ron and Hermione. Scrimgeou estures the trio to the sofa. Harry eyes Scrimgeou ith thinly concealed contempt.
_HARRY
"To what do we owe the pleasure, Minister?"
_SCRIMGEOUR
"I think we both know the answer to that question, Mr. Potter."
Scrimgeour pitches a CLOTH BAG onto the table befor hem. The trio regard it curiously, exchange glances.
_HARRY
"And this would be...?"
_SCRIMGEOUR
"Don't be coy, Mr. Potter. Mr. Weasley. Would you say you were close to your former Headmaster?"
_RON
"Dumbledore? And me? I dunno. I reckon I was just another Weasley to him. He was always polite --"
_SCRIMGEOUR
"And you, Miss Granger? How would you characterize your relationship?"
(CONTINUED)


39 CONTINUED:

_HERMIONE
"We were friendly, not close like Harry, but --"
_HARRY
"What's this all about?"
_SCRIMGEOUR
"This. Despite the fact that neither of your friends appear to have been particularly close to their recently deceased Headmaster, he saw fit to remember them in his will. Now why do you suppose that would be?"
Harry, Ron and Hermione exchange glances again.
_HARRY
"No idea."
_SCRIMGEOUR
"Come now, you don't expect me to believe..."
Scrimgeour reaches into his cloak, removes a SCROLL O ARCHMENT. READS:
_SCRIMGEOUR
 `Herein is set forth the Last Will
"and Testament of Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore. First, to Ronald Bilius Weasley, I leave my Deluminator, a device of my own making, in the hope that -- when things seem most dark -- it will show him the light.'"
Scrimgeour removes a SMALL SILVER OBJECT from the bag.
_RON
"Dumbledore left this? For me? Brilliant. Er -- what is it?"
Ron CLICKS it and all the light rushes from the lamp nto the Deluminator, throwing the room into tota arkness. He CLICKS it again and light flies back to th amps.
_RON
"Wicked."
(CONTINUED)
"30."

39 CONTINUED: (2)

_SCRIMGEOUR
 `To Miss Hermione Jean Granger, I
"leave my copy of The Tales of Beedle the Bard, in the hope that she will find it entertaining and instructive.'"
Scrimgeour reaches into the bag once again and retrieve  SMALL BOOK, its binding stained and peeling in places.
_RON
"Mum used to read me those! The Wizard and the Hopping Pot, Babbitty Rabbity and her Cackling Stump..."
Harry and Hermione stare blankly at him.
_RON
"Oh, c'mon! Beedle's stories are famous! Babbity Rabbitty? No...?"
Scrimgeour eyes Ron with mild annoyance, continues.
_SCRIMGEOUR
 `To Harry James Potter, I leave
"the Snitch he caught in his first Quidditch match at Hogwarts, as a reminder of the rewards of perseverance and skill."
Scrimgeour places the tiny golden orb onto Harry's palm here it glimmers dully. Harry studies it, then look p.
_HARRY
"That's it then?"
_SCRIMGEOUR
"Not quite. Dumbledore left you a second bequest: The Sword of Godric Gryffindor. Unfortunately, the Sword of Gryffindor was not Dumbledore's to give away. As an important historical artifact, it belongs..."
_HERMIONE
"To Harry! It belongs to Harry! It chose him! It came to him in the Chamber of Secrets when he most needed it!"
(CONTINUED)


39 CONTINUED: (3)

_SCRIMGEOUR
"The sword may present itself to any worthy Gryffindor, Miss Granger. That does not make it that wizard's property. And in any event the current whereabouts of the sword are unknown."
_HARRY
"Excuse me?"
_SCRIMGEOUR
"The sword is missing."
(before Harry can
 pursue)
"I won't pretend to be your friend, Mr. Potter. But I assure you I'm not your enemy."
_HARRY
"You'll forgive me, Minister. But it's a little hard to tell the difference these days."
_SCRIMGEOUR
"Dumbledore said something very similar the last time we spoke."
Scrimgeour gazes out the window, eyes haunted.
_HERMIONE
"Where is your guard, sir?"
_SCRIMGEOUR
"I came alone. I don't really need them anymore..."
He turns then, exits. MUSIC IS HEARD and LAUGHTER...

40 INT./EXT. MARQUEE - NIGHT (HOURS LATER) 40

The wedding party is in full swing. Harry, in dres obes, stands on the periphery, absently FINGERING TH NITCH as Bill and Fleur twirl madly within a clappin ircle of well-wishers. Harry's gaze drifts: to Ginny aughing as Fred and George rush the dance floor, briefl weep Fleur away from Bill, then begin to dance with eac ther; to Hermione, stunning in black silk: to Ron, wh gnores all, his eyes focused entirely on Hermione ar across the garden, Hagrid wends through the tables i is horrible hairy suit and presents a SLICE OF CAKE to  leased OLYMPE MAXIME CONTINUED)


40 CONTINUED: 40

Nearby, Tonks, hand to her belly, leans forward an HISPERS something to Mrs. Weasley, who reacts with happ urprise. Harry studies Tonks' belly...
_LUPIN (O.S.)
"We want you to be the godfather."
Harry turns, sees Lupin standing behind, staring at Tonk ith affection. As his eyes shift to Harry, Harr putters:
_HARRY
"You mean -- But that's brilliant -- I... don't know what to say."
_LUPIN
"Say yes."
Lupin grins, claps Harry on the shoulder and hikes of nto the darkness, joining the WIZARDS STANDING GUARD i he garden's deepest shadows. Harry looks back to Tonks hen notices a slight, TUFTY-HAIRED WIZARD (ELPHIAS DOGE itting alone at a table just beyond her.
_LUNA
"Hello, Harry!"
LUNA LOVEGOOD approaches in the company of a cross-eye izard (XENOPHILIUS LOVEGOOD) with shoulder-length whit air the texture of candy floss. Both wear robes th olor of egg yolk.
_LUNA
"Oh, I've interrupted a deep thought, haven't I? I can see it growing smaller in your eyes."
_HARRY
"No, `course not. How are you, Luna?"
_LUNA
"Very well. I was bitten by a garden gnome only moments ago."
She holds up her finger, which is sheathed in blood.
_XENOPHILIUS LOVEGOOD
"Gnome saliva is enormously beneficial! Xenophilius Lovegood. We live just over the hill!"
_HARRY
"Nice to meet you, sir."
(CONTINUED)


40 CONTINUED: (2) 40

Lovegood suddenly leans close, WHISPERS FIERCELY:
_XENOPHILIUS LOVEGOOD
"I trust you know, Mr. Potter, that we at The Quibbler, unlike those toadies at the Daily Prophet, fully supported Dumbledore during his lifetime and in his death support you just as fully."
_LUNA
"Come, Daddy. Harry doesn't want to talk to us right now. He's just too nice to say so."
Lovegood's eyes burn with righteousness, a TRIANGULAR EY angling from a chain around his neck. As Luna pulls hi way, Harry glances once again across the garden EW ANGLE - MOMENTS LATE LPHIAS DOGE sits alone, smiling absently as he observe he happy goings-on. Then:
_HARRY
"Sir? May I sit down?"
_ELPHIAS DOGE
"Mr. Potter! By all means!"
In a nervous flutter, Doge pours Harry a goblet o hampagne.
_HARRY
"I found what you wrote in the Daily Prophet very moving, sir. I take it you knew Professor Dumbledore well?"
_ELPHIAS DOGE
"I certainly knew him the longest, if you don't count his brother Aberforth -- and somehow, people never do seem to count Aberforth."
_HARRY
"I never even knew he had a brother, sir."
_ELPHIAS DOGE
"Yes, well, Dumbledore was always very private. Even as a boy."
(CONTINUED)


40 CONTINUED: (3) 40

_HARRY
"Sir, I was wondering if you'd had much contact with him before he died."
_ELPHIAS DOGE
"The occasional owl. Though it was strange..."
_HARRY
"Strange, sir?"
_ELPHIAS DOGE
"It was the owls themselves. They often arrived in distress. It was clear they'd traveled great distances in some cases."
_HARRY
"Could you tell me from where they'd come, sir?"
_ELPHIAS DOGE
"I'm afraid not. Albus' messages mostly referenced our days together as schoolboys. They were surprisingly intimate. When he did speak of his current activities his words would turn elliptical. Still, I sensed he was under great stress. Why do you ask?"
_HARRY
"Just curious. I was... close to Professor Dumbledore."
_ELPHIAS DOGE
"Well, he treasured you, Mr. Potter, I can attest to that. I can also tell you that when a person passes, it's only natural to rue the things left unsaid, to regret the question never asked. I knew Albus nigh on 100 years, but in many ways he will always remain a riddle even to me."
_WOMAN (O.S.)
"Don't despair, Elphias. I'm told he's been thoroughly unriddled by Rita Skeeter. In 800 pages no less."
(CONTINUED)


40 CONTINUED: (4) 40

Harry and Doge turn, study the profile of an ANCIEN ITCH (MURIEL) sitting at an adjacent table, a glass o hampagne cradled in the bony fingers of one hand.
_ELPHIAS DOGE
"That woman is a vulture, Muriel, and you well know it."
_MURIEL
"Someone has to pick the bones to get at the truth. I read your obituary, Elphias. Lovely. But you did skate over some of the sticky patches in Dumbledore's life."
_ELPHIAS DOGE
"I'm sorry you think so, Muriel. I assure you I was writing from the heart."
_MURIEL
"Yes, well, Rita Skeeter hasn't made that mistake, I'm sure. Word has it someone talked to her, someone who knew the Dumbledore family well. You and I both know who that is, Elphias."
_ELPHIAS DOGE
"A monstrous betrayal. I can only conclude the rumors are true and that she has become untethered."
_HARRY
"Who are you talking about?"
_MURIEL
"Well, I don't suppose it'll be a secret once the book comes out."
(relishing the
 moment)
"Bathilda Bagshot."
_HARRY
"Who?"
_MURIEL
"Who? Bathilda Bagshot! My god, boy, she's only the most celebrated magical historian of the last century. Don't they read History of Magic at Hogwarts anymore?"
(CONTINUED)


40 CONTINUED: (5) 40

_HARRY
"Oh, right. Slipped my mind..."
_MURIEL
"She knew the Dumbledores as well as anyone. She'd have letters, perhaps an interesting photograph or two. I'm sure Rita Skeeter would have thought it well worth a trip to Godric's Hollow to take a peek into that old bird's rattled cage."
_HARRY
"Godric's Hollow? Bathilda Bagshot lives in Godric's Hollow?"
_MURIEL
"For years now. That's where she first met Dumbledore."
_HARRY
"Excuse me? You don't mean to say Dumbledore lived there too?"
_MURIEL
"Of course. The family moved there after his father killed those three Muggles. It was quite the scandal."
(eyeing him)
"Honestly, my boy, are you sure you knew him at all?"
Harry sits, speechless, then his eye catches a shootin tar -- or what appears to be. As it plummets, it grows aining speed until it slices through the canopy xploding in a burst of light. All goes SILENT as  ILVER LYNX -- graceful and gleaming -- MATERIALIZES ami he crowd. When it speaks, the Patronus ha hacklebolt's sonorous voice.
_PATRONUS
"The Ministry has fallen. The Minister of Magic is dead. They are coming..."
The lynx vanishes. A SCREAM shreds the silence. Then haos.
_ELPHIAS DOGE
"Nice meeting you, Mr. Potter!"
Doge extends his hand toward Harry when -- CRACK! -- h ISAPPARATES CONTINUED)


40 CONTINUED: (6) 40

Seconds later, the ancient witch has done the same arry scans the scattering crowd and meets Ginny's eyes s she gets buffeted about. He pelts toward her ouncing between bodies, losing sight of her.
_HERMIONE
"Ron! Ron!"
Harry turns, sees Hermione glancing about frantically s she turns, Ron comes INTO VIEW, pushes toward her uddenly the canopy above turns to ribbons as DEAT ATERS -- in dark cloaks and masks -- descend into th rowd. Arthur, Fred and George wield their wands. Harr ees a flower fall from Fleur's hair, watches it crushe nderfoot, then catches sight of Ginny through th adness as she draws her own wand, copper hair gleaming yes flashing. He starts toward her, when... Lupi rashes in, spinning him roughly round.
_LUPIN
"Harry! Go! Go!"
A HAND REACHES OUT AND GRABS HIS. He looks. It' ermione, clutching Ron's hand with her other. Sh loses her eyes and a great WHOOSHING SOUND fills Harry' ars. He takes one last desperate look at Ginny as he i hrown up and back in a WHIRLWIND and all goes BLACK.  ORN BLARES as...

_RON
"Where are we?"
_HERMIONE
"Shaftesbury Avenue. I used to come here to the theater with my mum and dad. Just popped into my head. I don't know why..."
They hurry on, glancing over their shoulders at the DAR HAPES that move within the crowd behind them, STRANGER umping by, FACES passing in a paranoiac BLUR: a DRUNKE AN, a CACKLING WOMAN with BLOOD-RED LIPSTICK...
_HERMIONE
"This way!"


42 EXT. ALLEYWAY - CONTINUOUS ACTION - NIGHT

As they take refuge in the shadows, Hermione begins t ummage through her TINY BEADED PURSE.

Ron and Harry look at each other's dress robes. From th urse, Hermione extracts -- in quick succession -- tw airs of jeans, T-shirts, and a pair of light overcoats.
_RON
"How the ruddy --"
_HERMIONE
"Undetectable Extension Charm."
_RON
"You're amazing, you are."
_HERMIONE
"Always the tone of surprise."
As she gives the bag a shake, there is LOUD echoing o eavy objects, as if something has fallen.
_HERMIONE
"That'll be the books."

43 INT. ALL-NITE CAFE - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER)

Shabby. Greasy. Empty. The trio slide into a booth.
_HARRY
"Do you reckon everyone's alright at the wedding? Maybe we should --"
_RON
"They were after you, mate. We'd just put everyone in danger going back."
_HERMIONE
"Ron's right. Cappuccino, please."
A gum-chewing WAITRESS stands behind Harry. Ron lueless when it comes to cappuccinos, nods to Hermione.
_RON
"What she said."
_HARRY
"Same."

_WAITRESS
"Wicked scar."
_RON
(as she exits)
"So where do we go from here? The Leaky Cauldron?"
_HERMIONE
"Too dangerous. If Voldemort's taken over the Ministry, none of the old places are safe."
The front door SQUEALS and TWO WORKMEN enter, glance idl t the trio and step to the counter.
_HARRY
"My rucksack. With all my things. I left it back at the Burrow --"
Hermione is shaking her head. Harry eyes the beade urse.
_HARRY
"You're joking."
_HERMIONE
"I've had the essentials packed for days. Just in case."
_RON
"By the way -- these jeans? Not my favorite. Bit tight."
Hermione gives him a withering glance. Harry can't hel ut smile. Then his eyes shift to the SMALL SECURIT IRROR near the ceiling, see the two workmen turning.
_HARRY
"DOWN!"
The tile EXPLODES on the wall where Ron's head had bee nly seconds before. A rope of green light singe ermione's hair.

The JET of RED LIGHT hits the biggest Death Eate traight in the face and he crumples instantly.

The table behind Harry explodes and the spell ricochets hattering the security mirror -- sending shards rainin verywhere, including one that laces Hermione's cheek - hen striking the cappuccino machine, which sprays ho iquid all over the Death Eater. He BELLOWS in pain an ermione and Ron hit him with TWIN STUNNING SPELLS. A e spasms on the ground, Hermione adds another for goo easure:
_HERMIONE
"Petrificus Totalus!"
He goes still. The Waitress steps from the backroom ees the trio. The wands. Her gum bubble... POPS.
_HERMIONE
"Go."
She doesn't argue.
_HARRY
"Lock the door, get the lights."
Hermione throws the bolt. Ron clicks the Deluminator itching the cafe into shadow. Harry eyes th nconscious Death Eater.
_HARRY
"This one's name is Rowle. He was on the Astronomy Tower the night Snape killed Dumbledore."
_RON
"This is Dolohov. I recognize him from the wanted posters."
Ron rolls him over with his foot. Dolohov's eyes shif n fear from Harry to Hermione, then back to Ron.
_RON
"So what do we do with you, huh? Kill us if it was turned round, wouldn't you?"
Ron's face is hard. Hermione eyes him uneasily. H otices.
_RON
"Suppose it's him that did Mad-Eye. How would you feel then?"
Hermione looks at Dolohov. The moment hangs, then CONTINUED)

She turns, looks at him. He reaches out, wipes a trickl f blood from her cheek.

The trio move quickly, glancing about, paranoid.
_HARRY
"How is it they knew we were there?"
_HERMIONE
"Maybe you still have the Trace on you."
_RON
"Can't be. The Trace breaks at seventeen. It's Wizarding law."
Hermione stops. Harry and Ron turn, look back.
_RON
"What?"
_HERMIONE
"We didn't celebrate your birthday, Harry. Ginny and I -- we'd prepared a cake. We were going to bring it out at the end of the wedding..."

_HARRY
"Hermione. I appreciate the thought -- honestly. But given that we were almost killed by a couple of Death Eaters a few minutes ago..."

_MAD-EYE (O.S.)

_HARRY
"Mad-Eye...?"
Just then a great RUSH OF COLD AIR sweeps through th allway and the trio's tongues curl back in their mouths ome THING shifts in the shadows at the end of the hall ising from the carpet -- tall, dust-colored and terrible ooking -- then rushes toward them. It's Dumbledore, bu  ghostly, worm-eaten Dumbledore, a corpse come to life ith empty eye sockets and sunken face. It raises it and and then... EXPLODES in a great cloud of dust wirling like mist in the corridor, drifting back to th arpet.
_RON
"What was that about?"

Just then, a FLOORBOARD CREAKS. The trio stiffen lowly, Hermione draws her wand, peers into the shadows.
_HERMIONE
"Homenum revelio."
Nothing. Hermione lowers her wand. Explains.
_HERMIONE
"It's a spell to reveal human presence."
She extends her hand, watches the settling dust strea hrough her fingers.

Scratched int  wall is the SYMBOL Xenophilius Lovegood wore around hi eck, but the POV LINGERS upon it only briefly. A SIG omes INTO VIEW, hanging outside a small shop at the ver nd of a dark cul de sac: "GREGOROVITCH, WANDMAKER."

_HARRY (O.S.)
"Lumos."

50 INT. UPSTAIRS LANDING/CORRIDOR - MORNING (MOMENTS LATER) 50

Harry's wand BLOOMS in the darkness as he scales th tairs and reaches the landing. He peers into a bedroom he drawers have been turned out. The bedsheet tripped. He moves on, painting the wall with wandlight lluminating an EMPTY PORTRAIT of a MUDDY LANDSCAPE. H tudies it -- long enough that we'll remember it -- the  FLOORBOARD SQUEAKS -- like the night before. Harr heels, points his wand down the dark corridor adjacent.

In it, FOU OUNG HOGWARTS STUDENTS -- JAMES POTTER, SIRIUS BLACK ETER PETTIGREW and Lupin -- stand GRINNING before th HOMPING WILLOW. Harry traces the thin cone of light o is wand across their faces ooks and papers carpet the floor. A WOMAN'S FACE triking and wise, peers out from a dust jacket. Harr rouches, turns the book over to read its TITLE:  istory of Magic by Bathilda Bagshot. Harry turns i ACK over, studies the woman's face again. He begins t ise when he notices a CRUMPLED PIECE OF PAPER embosse t the top with a name: Lily Potter. As Harry begins t ead, we hear HER VOICE:

"Dear Sirius. Thank you for Harry's birthday present. You'd think he'd been born on a broom."

52 CONTINUED:

_LETTER (LILY) (V.O.) (CONT'D)
"James says he's got the look of a Seeker, but then James would. We had a very quiet birthday tea, just us and old Bathilda, who dotes on Harry. Wormy dropped by late in the day, but seemed down and didn't stay long. James is frustrated being shut up here, but Dumbledore's still got his Invisibility Cloak, so he doesn't have much choice. By the way, Bathilda tells the most amazing stories about our old Headmaster. I don't know how much to believe. Can it really be true that Dumbledore --"
Harry turns the letter over, but there is no more.

_HERMIONE
"Harry, you can't just disappear. We thought --"
She stops as Harry hands her the letter. She reads.
_HERMIONE
"It's from your Mum. To Sirius. Bathilda Bagshot...?"
_HARRY
"Yeah. They knew her. She wrote A History of Magic, you know."
_HERMIONE
(with irony)
"Did she now?"
(CONTINUED)


53 CONTINUED:

_HARRY
"I'm thinking maybe we should go talk to her. She still lives in Godric's Hollow. I'm thinking maybe she could help us."
Hermione looks up, regards Harry closely.
_HERMIONE
"Harry. I can imagine why you'd want to go there, but... I don't think Bathilda Bagshot is going to know where Voldemort hid his Horcruxes."
Harry starts to respond, frowns. Hermione reaches out ouches his face lightly.
_RON (O.S.)
"Hey! I think you two better come down here."

54 INT. FIRST FLOOR - MORNING (SECONDS LATER)

Ron peers out a curtain as Hermione and Harry join him n the courtyard outside, TWO DARK figures stand near  ree. ANOTHER sits on a bench.

_RON
"R.A.B. was Sirius' brother?"
We see the trio from the strange LOW POV again, sittin ound the kitchen table. SLOPPY STACKS of OLD DAIL ROPHETS surround them.
_HERMIONE
"Yes. Question is, did he actually destroy the real Horcrux?"
Harry nods... then spots a SHADOW trembling on the wal ust outside the kitchen. He scrambles up and out o ight.

_KREACHER
"Kreacher has been... watching. Kreacher always watches."
_HERMIONE
"Maybe he knows."
Harry glances at her, realizes what she means, takes th ocket and dangles it before Kreacher's massive eyes lik  hypnotist. Kreacher watches it sway back and forth.
_HARRY
"Ever seen this before?"
Kreacher GRUMBLES incoherently.
_HARRY
"Kreacher, I own this place. Sirius left it to me. Which means I own you too."
Kreacher grimaces mightily, then gives in.
_KREACHER
"That was Master Regulus' locket."
_HARRY
"That's right. But there were two, weren't there?"
Kreacher's eyes widen in surprise. He nods again.
_HARRY
"Where's the other one?"
_KREACHER
"Kreacher doesn't know where the other locket is."
_HERMIONE
"But was it here? Did you ever see it?"
Kreacher spins, his face ugly and vicious:
_KREACHER
"Filthy Mudblood -- The Death Eaters will soon be coming for you!"

"How do you mean?"
_KREACHER
"Before he died, Master Regulus ordered Kreacher to destroy it. It was the last thing he asked of Kreacher. But no matter how Kreacher tried, he could not.."
_HARRY
"Where is it now? Did someone take it, Kreacher?"
_KREACHER
(nodding)
"He came in the night. He took many things, including the locket."
_HARRY
"Who, Kreacher? Who was it?"

Harry turns, sees that Hermione is eyeing the Snitch.
_HERMIONE
"Snitches. They're never touched by bare skin until the Seeker captures it. Even the wizard who fabricates it wears gloves. That way, if there's a dispute, the Snitch can identify who first touched it."
_HARRY
"You mean... it remembers me?"

Harry starts to put the file away, the auses, looks closer. "Father: Arthur Weasley inistry Employee. Status: TRACKED. Strong likelihoo ndesirable #1 will contact." Harry stares at the word
"TRACKED." Then:
_BALDING WIZARD (O.S.)
"All right, all right. Let's calm down, shall we?"
Harry replaces the file, steps to the door and peer hrough. Slowly, he eases open the door, back out and...

_BALDING WIZARD
"It probably just snuck up here from Experimental Charms. I think none of us will soon forget last month's Poisonous Duck..."
Seeing the Red-Haired Witch's expression, the Baldin izard turns and, as before, withers at the sight o arry.
_BALDING WIZARD
"R-Runcorn."
Harry gives him an appraising look, turns the corner...

Harry sprints INTO VIEW just as the same MUTTERING WIZAR rails his QUILL out of an empty lift.

83 INT. LIFT - MORNING

Harry races inside, hits a button and watches the grille lose. He glances at his reflection in the mirrore all. Bares his teeth. Hermione's right. They'r wful. Just then, the grilles clang open and Ron enters oaking wet and wild-eyed.
_REG CATTERMOLE/RON
"M-morning."
_ALBERT RUNCORN/HARRY
"Ron, it's me."
_REG CATTERMOLE/RON
"Harry! Blimey, I forgot what you looked like. Where's Hermione?"
_ALBERT RUNCORN/HARRY
"She went down to the courtrooms with Umbridge --"
The grilles open again and reveal... Arthur Weasley, i he company of an elderly witch (WAKINDA).
_ARTHUR WEASLEY
"I understand, Wakinda, but I can't be a party to that."
Arthur stops then, seeing Harry, and regards him wit tter disdain, then turns his eyes to Ron and softens.
_ARTHUR WEASLEY
"Hello, Reg. Isn't Mary in for questioning today? Try to have faith. If there's anything Molly and I can do for you --"
Arthur pats Ron's shoulder, stops. Pulls his drippin and away.
_WAKINDA
"Let me guess. It's raining in Yaxley's office again?"
_ARTHUR WEASLEY
"Tell him to try an umbrella."
(CONTINUED)


83 CONTINUED:

Arthur and Wakinda exit. As they go, Ron cranes hi eck, watching with a look of longing as the grille egin to close. Suddenly, Harry reaches out, blocks th oors.
_ALBERT RUNCORN/HARRY
"Arthur! You know you're being tracked, don't you?"
Arthur turns.
_ARTHUR WEASLEY
"Is that a threat, Runcorn?"
_ALBERT RUNCORN/HARRY
"No, Arthur. It's a fact. They're watching you."
Arthur eyes Harry with a mixture of suspicion an onfusion and perhaps... recognition. Harry removes hi and. The grilles close. Ron stares at him.
_ALBERT RUNCORN/HARRY
"I'll tell you later. Let's find Hermione."

84 INT. PASSAGEWAY - MORNING (MOMENTS LATER)

Harry and Ron move down a dark torch-lit ston assageway. As they move further along, their BREAT ecomes VISIBLE and Ron, soaked to the bones, begins t remble.
_REG CATTERMOLE/RON
"Bloody cold down here."
Then they see. Swirling outside the courtroom doors lik entinels are tall black-hooded figures. DEMENTORS ust then, a man comes stumbling out of the courtroom i he company of a PAIR of DEATH EATERS.
_SCARED MAN
"I'm half-blood, I tell you! My father was a wizard! Look him up! William Alderton! He worked here for thirty years..."
As Ron watches the terrified man pass, Harry grabs hi rm, pulls him toward the courtroom.


85 INT. COURTROOM - SAME TIME - MORNING

A dark cathedral, possessed of a palpable chill ementors float eerily in the gloom. The ceilin tretches high, disappears in darkness. As Harry and Ro nter -- unnoticed at first -- they move cautiously aking in their surroundings. Hermione comes INTO VIEW itting with a STACK of PARCHMENT behind a balustrad longside Umbridge and Yaxley, while a BRIGHT-SILVER CA - Umbridge's Patronus -- prowls up and down, providin armth to them and them only. Harry's eyes track th at, then drift to Umbridge herself. Suddenly h alters. Ron notices. Eyes him curiously. WHISPERS:
_REG CATTERMOLE/RON
"What is it?"
The corners of Harry's eyes contract, his head slightl ocked... as if he can sense the presence of something.
_ALBERT RUNCORN/HARRY
"It's here..."
As Ron reacts -- deciphering Harry's words -- a WOMAN' OICE comes their way:
_MARY CATTERMOLE
"Reg..."
Ron turns. Below the balustrade, a frail woman, MAR ATTERMOLE, sits alone, wrists chained. Seeing Ron, he an face brightens. Ron glances at Harry, who nods rging him on. Ron moves to the center of the room aking his place behind the woman. Hesitating, he place is hands gently upon her shoulders, then glances up ees Hermione watching him.
_UMBRIDGE
"Mary Elizabeth Cattermole?"
_MARY CATTERMOLE
"Yes."
_UMBRIDGE
"Mother to Maisie, Ellie and Alfred? Wife to Reginald?"
Mary looks up to Ron, her eyes glistening with fear. H miles reassuringly. She looks away, replies:
_MARY CATTERMOLE
"Yes."

Harry eyes Umbridge. She has draped the pink scarf ove er chair, revealing a GOLD CHAIN that extends from he eck down into the ruffled folds of her blouse  slight HUMMING, faint and oddly lyrical, rings i arry's ears as he studies the chain. As if draw orward by some irresistible force, he begins to drif oward the balustrade.
_UMBRIDGE
"A wand was taken from you upon your arrival at the Ministry today, Mrs. Cattermole. Is this that wand?"
Umbridge displays a CHERRYWOOD WAND. Mary Cattermol ods.
_UMBRIDGE
"Would you please tell the court from which witch or wizard you took this wand."
(CONTINUED)


85 CONTINUED: (2)

_MARY CATTERMOLE
"But I didn't take it. I got it in Diagon Alley, at Ollivander's, when I was eleven. It chose me."
Umbridge leans forward, teeth glittering as the ca links by and briefly illuminates her face -- and th hain at her neck trembles like a snake, something heav winging forward and dangling over the void he LOCKET on stares at it dumbstruck. Hermione catches he reath. Harry, fully removed from the shadow now, stand learly in view, the corners of his eyes narrowing onc gain, the HUM growing louder in his ears. Slowly, h eaches into his pocket...
_UMBRIDGE
"No, no, I don't think so, Mrs. Cattermole. Wands only choose witches. And you are not a witch."
_MARY CATTERMOLE
"But I am! Tell them, Reg! Tell them what I am!"
Ron starts to speak, but Umbridge's gaze has shifted, t arry, to the wand rising in his hand.. and pointed a er.
_UMBRIDGE
"What the devil are you doing, Albert?"
As Harry speaks, his own face ripples through Runcorn's he Polyjuice Potion wearing off.
_ALBERT RUNCORN/HARRY
"You're lying. And one mustn't tell lies, Dolores... Stupefy!"
A flash of red light hits Umbridge and she slumps orehead striking the balustrade. Instantly the silve at vanishes. Yaxley draws his wand, but Ron is to uick and takes him out with a single blast. Hermion trips the locket from Umbridge's neck and leaps down nstantly, her breath comes in plumes as the Dementor rift forward.
_ALBERT RUNCORN/HARRY
"EXPETO PATRONUM!"
A SILVER STAG soars from the tip of Harry's wand ircling the room as it drives the Dementors back CONTINUED)

As the trio, along with Mary Cattermole, pelts into th trium and races toward the fireplaces, Harry bumps int he muttering wizard, who spins, takes a look at Harry links.
_MUTTERING WIZARD
"Harry Potter...?"
(louder)
"Harry Potter."
Another wizard hears, looks, then repeats the same arry's name spreading like wildfire in the gloomy hush ermione glances about nervously and as she does, begin o transform back into herself.
_HERMIONE
"Harry... they've seen you. We've got to get out of here."
Harry nods, quickens his pace. Ron glances about, the urns, facing Mary as he continues to walk backwards.
_REG CATTERMOLE/RON
"Mary. Go home. Get the kids. I'll... I'll meet you there. We have to get out the country, understand?"
Mary shakes her head, confused.
_REG CATTERMOLE/RON
"Mary! Do as I say!"
Mary stops, a bit teary-eyed, nods dutifully. Ro rowns.
_REG CATTERMOLE/RON
"I'm sorry. It's just --"
Mary Cattermole takes him by the collar, pulls him into  eep kiss. Harry and Hermione glance back and watch a on transforms -- during the kiss -- back into himself CONTINUED)


86 CONTINUED:

_REG CATTERMOLE
"MARY!"
All eyes turn. The real Reg Cattermole stands - obeless -- outside one of the fireplaces. She looks u t Ron, now transformed, and jumps back.
_RON
"Long story. Nice meeting you."
He gives her a peck, races off. He's halfway to th ireplaces when he spies... Percy. He slows, then stop ltogether, and they stare, wordless, at one another inally, Percy begins to open his mouth --
_RON
"Piss off."
Yaxley staggers into the atrium.
_YAXLEY
"Seal the exits! Now!"
Harry, Ron and Hermione glance at each other, break fo he fireplaces. As Yaxley fires on them, one fireplac fter another seals itself. As they reach the last ope rate, they pitch themselves -- as one -- onto th olished marble floor -- spells sailing over their head - and go sliding inside. As they fall into darkness arry glances back and watches Yaxley pitch himself int he void just before a solid block of granite drops - ike a guillotine -- sealing the fireplace and plungin axley -- and the trio -- into total darkness  whirlwind tosses the trio as FLASHES of LIGHT revea ach briefly, including Yaxley, who reaches out fo ermione's robe.

87 EXT. FOREST - DAY (MOMENTS LATER)

The world spins as Harry lies on his back on a bed o eaves and twigs. Above, sunlight streams through  anopy of trees. Wincing, Harry rises on his elbows ees the locket lying in the dirt. He scrabbles up coops it into his fingers and GRINS.

Harry turns, sees Hermione, bent over Ron's twitchin ody.
_HERMIONE
"Quickly!"
Harry blinks, stumbles dizzily to the bag. As he reache n, objects present themselves in furious succession.
_HARRY
"Accio Dittany."
A small BROWN BOTTLE lands in his palm.
_HERMIONE
"Unstopper it."
Hermione rips open Ron's shirt, which is soaked in blood he flesh of his upper arm is flayed, as if someone ha cooped a portion away.
_HARRY
"Hermione. His arm --"
_HERMIONE
"Just do it!"
Harry does so, hands her the bottle. She sprinkles thre rops onto Ron's BLEEDING WOUND. Greenish SMOKE billows.
_HARRY
"What happened? I thought we were going back to Grimmauld Place."
_HERMIONE
"We were. We were there. But Yaxley had hold of me. I knew we couldn't stay once he'd seen, so when he let go I brought us here. Ron got Splinched. I'm... sorry."
_HARRY
"Don't be stupid."
The smoke sifts, clears. Ron's wound no longer bleeds.
_HERMIONE
"It's all I feel safe doing."
Hermione rises, takes out her wand and begins to walk i  wide circle, MUTTERING.

"What're you doing?"
_HERMIONE
"Protective enchantments. I don't fancy another visit like we had on Shaftesbury Avenue, do you? Especially with Ron like this. You can get going on the tent..."
_HARRY
"Tent? Where am I supposed to find --"
He stops, glances down at her bag, then back to Hermione.
_HERMIONE
"Repello Muggletum... Muffliato..."

Hermione pours tea from a kettle into cups.
_HERMIONE
"How're the mushrooms? Seem to be the only edible things growing round here."
Harry grimaces as he chews. "Edible" is clearl ebatable.
_HARRY
"They're great."
_HERMIONE
"Make sure to leave some for Ron."
_HARRY
(under his breath)
"No problem."
Harry sets his plate aside, plucks up the locket, dangle t in the firelight. Glances at Ron.
_HARRY
"How bad is he?"

89 CONTINUED:

_HERMIONE
"He'll be alright in a few days. Hopefully. If we could take him to Hogwarts, to Madam Pomfrey --"
Harry's glance stops her, confirming what she knows.
_HERMIONE
"So where do we go next?"
_HARRY
"Dumbledore had a theory. He felt that the Horcruxes would not be made out of random objects. And he felt they wouldn't be hidden randomly either. We know of three so far. The ring, which according to Dumbledore belonged to Tom Riddle's grandfather. The diary, which belonged to Tom himself. And this, which -- again, according to Dumbledore -- belonged to his mother."
Hermione eyes the locket as it glimmers in the firelight.
_HERMIONE
"It scares me a bit, that, thinking it's a piece of Vol--"
_RON
"No, don't! Don't say it!"
Harry and Hermione turn, see Ron stirring.
_RON
"It's taboo -- You-Know-Who's name. That's how they track people now. It's how they found us in the cafe that night."
_HARRY
"How d'you know?"
_RON
"I overheard a bloke from the Enforcement office talking about it at the Ministry. Blimey, what's that smell?"
_HERMIONE
(no longer confident)
"Dinner?"

_RON
"Not bloody likely. Smells like something Ginny would cook."
_HERMIONE
"Tea?"
Ron nods. Grimacing, he pushes himself up, notices he' earing a SLING of Hermione's fashioning. He looks fro t to her as she tends the tea, a flicker of remors laying over his face for his "dinner" remarks.
_RON
"Is that it?"
Harry nods, hands him the locket. Ron turns it over i is hand. Frowns. Looks at Harry, who nods.
_HARRY
"I know. I felt it too."
(off Hermione's look)
"It's... it's like it's ticking or something, like it has a tiny metal heart, like it's --"
_RON

Harry nods. Hermione eyes it coldly.
_HERMIONE
"I hate it. It's like he's here with us."
_HARRY
"That's why we're going to kill it."

"Confringo!"
The ground beneath the stump craters, but the locke emains untouched. Hermione lowers her wand, but Harr ontinues on, firing a succession of spells, lookin lmost possessed. Hermione studies him oddly until inally, he stops. All goes silent except for the leave hifting in wind above. Then, slowly, another soun omes clear... a TICKING. Coming from the locket.
_RON
"It's angry."
Hermione shivers. Harry steps forward, kneels down an akes the locket by its chain. It TICKS. He slings i ver his neck. Rises.
_HERMIONE
"What're you doing?"
_HARRY
"We have to keep it safe until we can figure out how to destroy it."
_HERMIONE
"I can put it in my bag --"
_HARRY
"No."
_RON
"Seems strange, mate. Dumbledore sends you off to find a load of Horcruxes, but doesn't bother to tell you how to destroy them. Doesn't that bother you?"
Harry studies the locket, whose TICKING has slowed, the alks off. Hermione eyes Ron, who returns her glance hen pushes away from the tree and walks off slowly i he opposite direction.

Noticing the locket, h lips it from his shirt, studies the fissures in th ocket's metal skin. Suddenly he WINCES. The locke pills from his palm, dances upon the chain.

Harry's eyes flutter open. He sees Hermione, beautifu n the amber dusk, standing a bit away, studying him.
_HERMIONE
"I thought it had stopped."
Harry looks at her, shakes his head.
_HERMIONE
"You can't let him in, Harry. Dumbledore himself said it. You have to close your mind. It's too dangerous --"
_HARRY
"It's not a candle I can blow out, Hermione. It always burns, even if it's just a flicker. Can you understand that?"

_HERMIONE
"Don't -- It... comforts him."
_HARRY
"Well it sets my teeth on edge. What's he expecting to hear? Good news?"
_HERMIONE
"I think he just hopes he doesn't hear bad news. It gets him through the day."
_HARRY
"And what gets you through the day?"
_HERMIONE
"We've all made sacrifices, Harry."
Harry eyes her expressionlessly, nods toward the tent.
_HARRY
"How long before he can travel?"
_HERMIONE
"I don't know. It takes time. I'm doing all I can."
_HARRY
"You're not doing enough."
Hermione studies Harry's angry profile. Then:

The charred husks of several RVs -- hulking black masse - lay about the ash-ridden park. Ron, trailed by Harr nd Hermione, pauses. His eyes scan the scorched earth ix on a BLACKENED SWING, swaying back and forth in  iny playground. His eyes shift to the ground and h rouches. His fingers shift the dry dirt, reveal a SHIN OY not of Muggle making.
_RON
"Wizards were here."

"I don't like this place."
Harry and Ron both turn, look at her.

_HERMIONE
"Oh my god..."
_HARRY
(alarmed)
"What?"
_HERMIONE
"I'll tell you in a minute."
Harry watches his hair dropping to the ground.
_HARRY
"Maybe you could tell me now."
_HERMIONE
"Alright. The Sword of Gryffindor? It's Goblin made."
_HARRY
"Brilliant."
_HERMIONE
"You don't understand. Dirt and rust have no effect on the blade. It only takes in that which makes it stronger."
_HARRY
"O-kay."
_HERMIONE
"Harry. You already destroyed one Horcrux, right? Tom Riddle's diary -- in the Chamber of Secrets."
_HARRY
"With a basilisk fang. If you tell me you've got one of those in that bloody beaded bag of yours --"

_HARRY
 ... it can destroy Horcruxes.
_HERMIONE
"Which is why Dumbledore left it to you in his will."
_HARRY
"You're brilliant, Hermione. Truly."
_HERMIONE
"Actually, I'm highly logical, which allows me to look past the extraneous detail and perceive clearly that which others overlook."
_HARRY
"There's only one problem..."
Suddenly the LIGHTS CLICK OFF...
_RON
"The sword was stolen."
The lights click back ON. Hermione and Harry turn, se on, Deluminator in hand, lying in the shadows of hi unk, staring at the roof as the FIRST DROPS OF RAIN hi he canvas above.
_RON
"Yeah, I'm still here. But you two carry on. Don't let me spoil your fun."

"Ron..."
_HARRY
"I thought you knew what you signed up for."
_RON
"Yeah, I thought I did too."
_HARRY
"I don't understand. What part of this isn't living up to your expectations? Did you think we'd be staying in five-star hotels? Finding a Horcrux every other day? Did you think you'd be back to Mummy by Christmas?"
_RON
"No, I just reckoned after all this time, we'd have actually achieved something. I reckoned you knew what you were doing. I reckoned Dumbledore had told you something worthwhile! I reckoned you had a plan!"
_HARRY
"I've told you everything Dumbledore told me! And in case you haven't noticed, we've found a Horcrux!"
_RON
"Yeah, and we're about as near getting rid of it as we are to finding the rest of them, aren't we!"

_HERMIONE
"Harry, we weren't --"
_RON
"Don't lie! You said it, too, you said you were disappointed --"
_HERMIONE
"I didn't! Not like that! Harry -- I didn't!"
_RON
"Do you know why I listen to that radio, every night? Do you! To make sure I don't hear Ginny's name or Fred or George or Mum or --"

"You think I don't listen! You think I don't know what it's like --"

He whips aside the tent flap and the RAIN ROARS. A ermione rushes after him, she tips over the radio. A t HISSES Harry glowers at the Horcrux. Seconds later ermione returns, sopping hair plastered to her face.

"He's gone."

As Harry ducks into the tent, Hermione looks up.

"It's a Muggle station."
Hermione smiles and Harry does too. Harry listens then ebating, reaches out his hand. Hermione eyes hi ncertainly, then allows him to pull her to her feet.

Folding his fingers around the orb, he brings it to hi ips briefly, then turns it over in his palm he Snitch's tired wings go still. Then, as if writte y an invisible hand, WORDS appear on the smooth golde urface:
 "I open at the close."
_HARRY
"Hermione."

119 EXT. HILLSIDE - CONTINUOUS ACTION - DAY

Harry slips through the flap, hands her the Snitch.
_HARRY
"You were right. It's like you said. Snitches have flesh memories. But I didn't catch my first Snitch with my hand. I almost swallowed it."
Hermione watches the WORDS VANISH on orb.
_HERMIONE
 `I open at the close?'
_HARRY
"What do you reckon it means?"
_HERMIONE
"I don't know. But look, I've found something as well..."
She turns The Tales of Beedle the Bard into th lickering light, points to the top of the title page, t  SMALL DRAWING of a TRIANGULAR EYE.
_HERMIONE
"I thought it was a picture of an eye, but now I don't think it is. It isn't a rune and it's not in Spellman's Syllabary either. And it's been inked in -- somebody drew it -- it isn't part of the book."
_HARRY
"Luna's dad was wearing that, at Ron-"
(catching himself)
"At Bill and Fleur's wedding."
(CONTINUED)


119 CONTINUED:

_HERMIONE
"What d'you mean -- wearing it?"
_HARRY
"Around his neck. Like an amulet. I didn't think much of it at the time. You know Luna -- she's always got some mad thing or the other she's carrying around. I just figured it ran in the family."
_HERMIONE
"Why would someone have drawn it in a children's book?"
As Hermione shakes her head, musing, Harry eyes her.
_HARRY
"Hermione, I've been thinking. I -- I want to go to Godric's Hollow. It's where I was born, it's where my parents died --"
_HERMIONE
"And it's exactly where You-Know- Who will expect you to go. Because it means something to you."
_HARRY
"But it means something to him too, Hermione. You-Know-Who nearly died there. Wouldn't that be just the kind of place he'd hide a Horcrux?"
Hermione eyes him. Despite herself, she knows he' ight.
_HERMIONE
"It's dangerous, Harry. But I have to admit, recently even I've been thinking we might have to go. I think it's possible something else is hidden there."
(off Harry's look)
"The sword. If Dumbledore didn't want it falling into the Ministry's hands, but wanted you to find it, what better place to hide it than the birthplace of the founder of Gryffindor himself?"
(CONTINUED)


119 CONTINUED: (2)

_HARRY
"Godric's Hollow is the birthplace of Godric Gryffindor -- I mean,"
 `course it is. Obvious, isn't it?
_HERMIONE
(eyeing him
 knowingly)
"Harry, did you ever even open A History of Magic?"
_HARRY
"Tossed it at Neville once when he was snoring -- might've popped open."
She smiles, then rises, collecting her books and blanket.
_HARRY
"Hermione..."
Words fail him. Hermione reaches out, lightly stroke is hair as she heads toward the tent.

_HARRY
"C'mon."

_HERMIONE
"I don't think this is a good idea."
_HARRY
"We look like ordinary Muggles."
_HERMIONE
"Muggles who've just been laying flowers on your parents' grave."
Just then, up ahead, the stooped woman holds up her han nd Hermione and Harry stop. Seconds later, a group o NATCHERS passes by the alley. As they vanish, the woma ontinues on.
_HARRY
"Relax. This is right. I know it."

"This is where they died, Hermione. This is where he murdered them."
Hermione studies Harry's bitter profile, then the house areful not to disturb the moment with words. Absently arry places his fingers upon the locket at his chest t is trembling -- over-so-slightly. Then, withou urning, while still staring at the house, Harry speaks:

The door rattles open and tiny BATHILDA BAGSHOT hobble nside, followed first by Harry, then Hermione, wh rinkles her nose. As Bathilda exits the room, Hermion lances about.
_HERMIONE
"Harry, I'm not sure about this."
_HARRY
"Hermione, she knew Dumbledore. She might have the sword. Besides, she's barely knee-high to a house-elf. I think we can overpower her if it turns ugly."
_HERMIONE
"There's something odd about her. And what's that smell?"

_HERMIONE
"The Forest of Dean. I came here once with my mum and dad, years ago. It's just how I remember it. The trees. The river. It's like nothing's changed. Not true, of course. Everything's changed. If I brought my parents here, they wouldn't recognize any of it. Not the trees. Not the river. Not... me."

_HARRY
"Get to the hard part, Hermione."
_HERMIONE
"She introduced him to Dumbledore. It made sense. Dumbledore's mother had just died, Grindelwald was troubled and they were both brilliant -- they'd never really had anyone they could talk to on the same level. They did a lot of talking that summer. But they always returned to one particular subject."
Harry looks up.
_HERMIONE
"Wizard rule over Muggles."
_HARRY
"And Dumbledore believed in it?"
_HERMIONE
"Yes."
Harry nods, looking at the photograph again.
_HARRY
 `For the Greater Good.' What does
"that mean?"
_HERMIONE
"It was something Dumbledore came up with. He believed wizards were superior and should rule over Muggles, but gently, for their own good. Grindelwald took a more violent position."
Harry shakes his head, staring at the book.
_HERMIONE
"It was a different time, Harry. It was one summer. Dumbledore was young --"
_HARRY
"We're young, Hermione. And here we are, risking our lives to fight against the very thing Dumbledore supported."

Harry stares at the photograph of the laughing thief on ast moment, then tosses the book away.
_HARRY
"Where's my wand? I'll take the watch."
Hermione hesitates. Her expression makes hi pprehensive.
_HARRY
"Hermione. Where's my wand?"
She points. There, lying by the fire, is a shattere tick. He picks it up gently, sees that it is nearl evered in two. One fragile strand of phoenix feathe olds it together.
_HERMIONE
"It's my fault. As we were leaving Godric's Hollow, I cast a curse and it rebounded... I'm sorry, Harry, I tried to mend it but wands are different --"
_HARRY
"It's done."
_HERMIONE
"Maybe we can --"
_HARRY
"It's done."
His tone puts an end to it. She nods.
_HARRY
"Leave me yours. You get back in the warm. And give me that."
Harry gestures to the locket. Hermione starts to speak hen simply hands it over. She starts to leave, pauses.
_HERMIONE
"He loved you, Harry. I know he loved you."
She trails her fingers lightly over his hair, and h loses his eyes. We --

140 EXT. TENT (FOREST OF DEAN) - NIGHT (LATER) 140

The fire is merely embers. Harry sits with a frost ncrusted blanket draped over his shoulders, starin itterly into the dark forest. The silence is eerie HADOWS play in the trees. He peers through the ten lap and sees Hermione slumbering in the light of a SMAL OWL of FLAMES. Then, slowly, LIGHT CRAWLS briefly ove he tent canvas and he turns, peers into the forest onc ore. Something seems to GLIMMER FAINTLY, but so briefl s to seem a trick of the eye. The air is cold, give exture to the darkness, makes it a living thing CONTINUED)
"101."

140 CONTINUED: 140

And then it is there again, the LIGHT -- pure and brigh nd silver and moving through the trees toward him arry rises and the blanket slithers off his shoulders ripping Hermione's wand, he watches the LIGHT drif loser, then shatter throughout the trees, momentaril linding. And then it appears.. .. a SILVER-WHITE DOE, moon-bright and dazzling. I azes at Harry and he stands, transfixed. And then th oe turns away. His voice cracks:
_HARRY
"No..."

141 EXT. FOREST OF DEAN - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER)

FROST CRUNCHES beneath Harry's feet as he dashes throug he trees in pursuit of the silent doe up ahead, breat treaming from his lungs. She leads him deep into th orest until, finally, she stops, as does Harry. As h atches, she turns her beautiful head toward him... an anishes. For a moment, a GHOST IMAGE of her, like  etina burn, hangs in the air and then Harry is plunge nto darkness.
_HARRY
"Lumos!"
Hermione's wand-tip ignites. Harry paints the clearin ith light and something GLEAMS: a small FROZEN POOL e crosses to it, looks down. He sees his own imag eflected dully and then, deeper, within, a SILVER CROSS e looks closer t is the SWORD OF GRYFFINDOR arry steps back, blinks. It's still there. He glance bout, painting the trees with light, looking to insur e is alone, then casts light upon the pool once more.
_HARRY
"Accio Sword."
Nothing. Harry walks about the pool again and again an hen stops. He crouches.. .. and looks slowly down at his chest. The Horcru round his neck has begun to TWITCH. Harry places hi ingers upon it briefly, then rises. Quickly, wit umbling fingers, he SHEDS his clothes and point ermione's wand at the pool CONTINUED)
"102."

141 CONTINUED:

_HARRY
"Diffindo."
The pool's icey crust CRACKS, echoing in the silence HUNKS of DARK ICE rock the surface. Harry steps to th ool's edge, peers within... and PLUNGES...

As the links bite into his throat e releases the sword and begins to thrash about truggling to get his fingers under the chain.

Slowly, his hands go limp and slip from th ce back into.. .. the water, where he drifts slowly down, a slow trai f bubbles escaping his mouth, eyes half-closed as h eers upward, watching as the surface of the water grow lowly calm... peaceful... when... a SHADOW appear nd.. .. a PAIR of HANDS shatter the glassy surface of th ater and Harry is pulled upward and out, landing...

... face-down on the frigid ground, choking and retching.
_HARRY
"Hermione..."
A HAND reaches in, strips the locket from his neck.
_RON
"Are -- you -- mental?"
Harry's eyes pop open. Standing a few yards away, full ressed and half-drenched, clutching the sword of - ryffindor in one hand and the locket in the other, i on. Harry just stares, then begins to pull on hi lothes CONTINUED)

_RON
"Well, yeah. Bit obvious, I'd think."
_HARRY
"And the doe. That was you as well."
_RON
"No. I reckoned it was you."
_HARRY
"My Patronus is a stag."
_RON
"Right. Antlers."
Ron brings his arms up, vaguely pantomiming antlers, bu he effect is lost, what with the sword and locket.
_HARRY
"You didn't see anyone else?"
_RON
"No, I... I did think maybe I saw something -- when I was running -- over there --"
Harry crosses to a pair of OAKS grown close together.
_RON
"Anything?"
_HARRY
(shaking his head)
"But I reckon whoever cast the doe, put the sword in that pool hoping we'd find it."
_RON
"And we did, didn't we?"
The "we" hangs in the chill air. Harry eyes Ron, the teps forward and dangles the locket close to the sword t immediately begins to TWITCH.
_HARRY
"See that? It knows. It's afraid."
(looking up)
"Do it."

_RON
"What? No. Harry. That thing's bad for me. I can't handle it. I'm not making excuses for how I acted, but that thing affects me more than it affects you and Hermione. It made me think stuff -- stuff I was thinking anyway, but it made everything worse."
_HARRY
"All the more reason."
_RON
"No. I can't --"
_HARRY
"Then why are you here? Why did you come back?"
Harry's tone is hard, meant to wound. This stops Ron e steps back, grips the sword with both hands. Harr ods.
_HARRY
"I'll have to speak to it in order for it to open. When it does, don't hesitate. I don't know what's in here, but it'll put up a fight. The bit of Riddle that was in his diary tried to kill me."
Ron nods and then Harry sweeps a layer of frost from  lat rock, lays the locket down.
_HARRY
"On three. One. Two. Three."
(in Parseltongue)
"Take me inside..."
Click! The twin doors of the locket SNAP open. Behin ach glass window a LIVING EYE blinks -- Tom Riddle' yes.
_HARRY
"Stab it, Ron. Now."
Ron raises his trembling hands, poises the sword. Then  OICE hisses from the Horcrux.

"Least loved, by the mother who craved a daughter. Least loved, by the girl who prefers your friend..."
_HARRY
"Ron. Stab it!"
The locket QUIVERS in Harry's fingers, turning WHITE-HOT nd he releases it. As the eyes gleam SCARLET, Harr rimaces and a FLASH OF BLINDING LIGHT BURSTS forth eaving in its wake two FIGURES floating in the darknes - GHOST IMAGES of Harry and Hermione.
_RIDDLE-HARRY
"We were better without you, happier without you."
_RIDDLE-HERMIONE
"Who could look at you beside Harry Potter? What are you, compared with the Chosen One...?"
Ron stands transfixed, sword in hand, horrified.
_HARRY
"Ron. It lies! Stab it! STAB IT!"
_RIDDLE-HARRY
"Your mother confessed that she would have preferred me as a son..."
_RIDDLE-HERMIONE
"Who wouldn't prefer him, what woman would take you, you are nothing, nothing, nothing to him..."

_HARRY
"Do it, Ron! Kill it!"
Ron's head turns then, to Harry, and Harry freezes.  race of SCARLET glints in Ron's eyes. He raises th word high and -- for a moment -- Harry looks fearful hen, Ron pivots and brings the blade down hard, cleavin he locket. A SCREAM echoes throughout the forest an he ghostly Harry and Hermione turn to dust, becoming on ith the vapor drifting from Ron's mouth and all is.. uiet arry eyes the shattered locket, then turns his gaze o on who stands alone, sword dangling from the end of hi rm, chest heaving arry scoops up the locket and examines it. Riddle' yes are gone, the silk lining stained and faintl moking. Ron lets the sword fall to the ground, drops t is knees. Harry steps forward and -- carefully - laces a hand upon his shoulder.
_HARRY
"After you left, she cried for a week. She's like my sister."
_RON
"I'm sorry. I'm sorry I left."
_HARRY
"You've sort of made up for it tonight. Getting the sword. Finishing off the Horcrux."
_RON
"Saving your life."
_HARRY
"That too."
They both stare at the remains of the locket.
_RON
"And just think of it. Only three to go."

Harry sticks the sword in the ground. As Hermion merges, she blinks against the brightness of the mornin un.
_HERMIONE
"Everything all right?"
_HARRY
"Fine. Actually... more than fine."
He steps aside and Hermione sees Ron, standing at th dge of the camp. She stares, mute, then walks pas arry and the ashes of the campfire, stopping right i ront of Ron. He raises a hand, smiles sheepishly.
_RON
"Hey."
And then... Hermione begins to PUNCH HIM.
_RON
"Wo -- hey -- ouch!"

(with each punch)
"You -- complete -- arse -- Ronald -- Weasley! You crawl back here after all these weeks and say,"

Harry places his hand over his pocket.
_HARRY

Hermione glances at Harry. He indicates Ron. She turn ack to Ron. He nods. She starts to speak when her eye hift, see the sword stuck in the ground.
_HERMIONE
_And exactly how is it you have the
_Sword of Gryffindor?
_HARRY
_It's a long story.
Hermione ponders this, baffled, then looks back at Ron.
_HERMIONE
_Don't think this changes anything.
_RON
_No, of course not. I only
 destroyed a bloody freaking
_Horcrux! Why would that change
 anything! Do you know what it was

 coming from you! To see you doing
 those things --
Ron stops.
_HERMIONE
_See me doing what things?
Ron blinks, mortified. Hermione turns to Harry.
_HERMIONE
_What happened out there?
_HARRY
(at a loss, then)
_It's a long story.
_RON
_Look, I wanted to come back the

_HARRY
"It?"
_RON
"A voice."
Ron turns to Hermione, holds up the Deluminator.
_RON
"Your voice, Hermione. Coming out of this."
_HERMIONE
"And what may I ask did I say?"
_RON
"My name. Just my name. Like a whisper."
Hermione stands perfectly still... and blushes.
_RON
"So I took this and I clicked it and this tiny ball of light appeared. And I knew."
_HARRY
"Knew what?"
_RON
"Just knew. On account of Hermione's voice. And sure enough, it floated toward me, the ball of light, right to my chest and then -- went straight through -- right here."
Ron touches a point close to his heart.
_RON
"I could feel it inside me. It was warm, like the first sip of a good cup of tea. And I knew it would take me where I needed to go."

146 INT. TENT (FOREST OF DEAN) - NIGHT

Harry lies in his bunk while Ron sits cross-legged arming his hands over a bowl of FLAMES.
_RON
"I've always liked it. These flames Hermione makes."
Harry peers at the bowl, then beyond the tent flap, see ermione sitting just outside, keeping watch.
_RON
"How long you reckon she'll stay mad at me?"
_HARRY
"Keep talking `bout that little ball of light touching your heart -- she'll come round."
_RON
"It was true. Every word."
(a beat)
"You're going to think I'm mental, but I think that's why Dumbledore left it to me -- the Deluminator. I think he knew that at some point I'd... need to find my way back. And she'd lead me."
Harry eyes Ron, pondering this. Then suddenly, Ron jump p, grabs his own rucksack and begins to fish through it.
_RON
"Bloody hell. I just realized. You need a wand, right?"
_HARRY
"Yeah..."
_RON
"Well, I've got one. Here. It's Blackthorn, ten inches, nothing special, but I reckon it'll do. I took it off a Snatcher a few weeks back."

The flames FLARE MASSIVELY and Ron leaps back.
_RON

As the flames subside, Ron pats down a small flare-up o he canvas.
_HERMIONE
"What's going on in there?"
_HARRY/RON
"Nothing."
_RON
(to Harry)
"Maybe a bit more practice, eh?"
_HERMIONE
"We need to talk."
Ron wheels, sees Hermione standing in the mouth of th ent, Life and Lies in hand, looking at Harry.
_RON
"All right."
_HERMIONE

"I want to go and see Xenophilius Lovegood."
_HARRY
"Sorry?"
_HERMIONE
"See this? It's a letter Dumbledore wrote to Grindelwald. Look at the signature. It's the mark again."
Hermione turns the book in Harry's direction. Dumbledor eplaced the "A" in Albus with the TRIANGULAR EYE.

They all look down at the symbol etched in Dumbledore' ine hand in the book.
_HERMIONE
"Harry, you don't have a clue where the next Horcrux is. And neither do I. But this, this means something. I'm sure of it."
_RON
"I think Hermione's right. I think we ought to go and see Lovegood. What say we vote on it? Those in favor..."
Ron's hand flies into the air. Harry eyes him knowingly ermione rolls her eyes, then lifts her hand as well.

Lovegood's eyes drift to Harry's scar.

Great tottering towers of Quibbler back-issues rise t he ceiling while an old-fashioned WOODEN PRINTING PRES hugs away in the center of the room, spitting out ne nes.

The trio exchange glances.
_RON
"Aren't you the one who keeps telling everyone it's their first duty to help Harry?"
_XENOPHILIUS LOVEGOOD
"I have expressed that view, yes. In the past. Would you excuse me one moment. I shall return shortly and, um, try to help you..."
Lovegood dashes from the room.
_HARRY
"What's going on here?"

Lovegood reaches into his nightshirt and pulls out th hain with the TRIANGULAR EYE.

_XENOPHILIUS LOVEGOOD
"The Deathly Hallows. I assume you're all familiar with `The Tale of the Three Brothers?' HERMIONE/RON HARRY"
Yes. No arry looks at the others, then Hermione reaches into he eaded bag and pulls out The Tales of Beedle the Bard.
_HERMIONE
"It's in here."
_XENOPHILIUS LOVEGOOD
"Well, there's no real reason to go on unless one is familiar with the tale. Why don't you read it aloud, Miss...?"
_HERMIONE
"Granger. Well... all right."

"There were once three brothers who were traveling along a lonely, winding road at twilight --"
_RON
"Midnight. Mum always said midnight."

"But twilight's fine. Better actually."

"In time, the brothers reached a river too treacherous to pass..."

152 STORY - EXT. RIVER/BRIDGE - TWILIGHT

... as the crow swoops over a river to reveal THRE ILHOUETTES.
_HERMIONE (V.O.)
"But being learned in the magical arts, the three brothers simply waved their wands and made a bridge. They were halfway across it when they found their path blocked by a hooded figure."
(CONTINUED)


152 CONTINUED:

A BRIDGE MAGICALLY MATERIALIZES and the three figure egin to cross, when the HOODED FIGURE appears.
_HERMIONE (V.O.)
"It was Death and he felt cheated, for travelers usually drowned in the river. But Death was cunning. He granted each brother a wish for their cleverness. The oldest, who was a combative man, asked for a wand more powerful than any in existence. So Death fashioned one from an elder tree on the banks of the river."
All of this is dramatized in surreal silhouette.
_HERMIONE (V.O.)
"The second brother, who was an arrogant man, asked for the power to recall others from Death. So Death plucked a stone from the river. Finally Death turned to the third brother. A humble man, he asked for something that would make him disappear. And so it was that Death handed over his own Cloak of Invisibility. Death then stepped aside and the brothers went their separate ways..."
We see the brothers cross the bridge, and part.
_HERMIONE (V.O.)
"The first brother traveled to a distant village where, with Elder Wand in hand, he killed a wizard with whom he had once quarreled. Proceeding to an Inn, he bragged of his invincibility. But that very night..."
We see a wizard, in shadow, slip into a room, KNIFE i and.
_HERMIONE (V.O.)
 ... another wizard crept upon him
"as he lay sleeping. He took the Elder Wand... and slit the brother's throat for good measure. And so Death took the first brother for his own..."
We see the second brother approach a cottage CONTINUED)


152 CONTINUED: (2)

_HERMIONE (V.O.)
"Meanwhile, the second brother journeyed to his home, where he took out the stone and turned it thrice in hand. To his delight, the girl he had once hoped to marry before her untimely death appeared before him. Yet soon she turned sad and cold, for she did not belong in the mortal world. Driven mad with hopeless longing, the second brother killed himself so as to join her. And so Death took the second brother..."
We see Death etched upon a bleak hillside.
_HERMIONE (V.O.)
"As for the third brother, Death searched for many years but was never able to find him. Only when he had attained a great age did the youngest brother shed the Cloak of Invisibility and give it to his son. He then greeted Death as an old friend and went with him gladly, departing this life as equals..."
As Death and the third brother retreat, the crow returns eating into the sky, which LIGHTENS, and we PULL BACK...

The trio stare at the symbol.
_HERMIONE
"Mr. Lovegood, does the Peverell family have anything to do with the Deathly Hallows?"
(to Harry and Ron)
"That was the name on the grave with the mark on it in Godric's Hollow. Ignotus Peverell."
_XENOPHILIUS LOVEGOOD
"Ignotus and his brothers Cadmus and Antioch are thought to be the original owners of the Hallows and therefore the inspiration for the story."
Lovegood's focus abruptly wavers, sadness in his eyes hen he blinks, eyes the tea kettle.
_XENOPHILIUS LOVEGOOD
"Ah, but your tea's grown cold. Excuse me, I'll be right back."
_RON

"You're supposed to say the Cloak, but who wants to spend all day being invisible. Dead boring if you ask me. But an unbeatable wand!"
_HERMIONE
"Its owner grew drunk with power and was murdered."
_RON
"Yeah, but imagine what a short wicked life you'd lead."
_HERMIONE
(rolling her eyes)
"Why the Stone, Harry?"
_HARRY
"Well, you could bring people back, couldn't you? Mad-Eye. Dumbledore. Sirius. Anybody."
_HERMIONE
(gentle
"But according to the story they don't want to come back. It's all rubbish anyway. There's no such thing as the Deathly Hallows."
_HARRY
"But I have one. The Invisibility Cloak my father left me."
_HERMIONE
"There have always been Cloaks --"
_RON
"Not like Harry's. I've seen a fair few. Dad used to bring home the ones the Ministry confiscated from petty thieves and the like. They always got holes or tears. Harry's is different. It's perfect."

_HARRY
"And I think I've actually held the Resurrection Stone in my hands, that night in Dumbledore's office when he showed me the ring he'd destroyed, the Horcrux. It had a symbol on it. Now I think it was the mark of the Hallows."
The trio stand silently when Lovegood returns.
_HERMIONE
"Mr. Lovegood. Thank you, sir --"
_RON
"You forgot the water."
_XENOPHILIUS LOVEGOOD
"The water?"
_RON
"For the tea."
_XENOPHILIUS LOVEGOOD
"Did, didn't I? How silly of me."
_HERMIONE
"No matter, sir. We really ought to be go--"
_XENOPHILIUS LOVEGOOD
"No, you mustn't --"
_HARRY
"Sir?"
_XENOPHILIUS LOVEGOOD
"You're my only hope. They were angry, you see, about what I'd been writing, so they took her. They took my Luna..."
(eyes finding Harry)
"But it's really you they want..."
_HARRY
"Who took her, sir?"
Hermione eyes the printing press. A copy of the Quibble ies stuck under a roller. She reaches out, pulls i ree, the INK STREAKING over the cover, over HARRY'S FAC nd the BLAZING HEADLINE: UNDESIRABLE NUMBER #1 CONTINUED)


153 CONTINUED: (4)

_XENOPHILIUS LOVEGOOD
"Him. Surely you call him You-Know- Who. But his real name of course is... Voldemort."
_RON
"Nooooooooo!"
Instantly, out the window, FIGURES on BROOMSTICKS appea n the sky, jetting directly toward the house. As Harry on and Hermione hit the floor, ROPES of LIGHT ricoche ff the windowsill. The printing press EXPLODES, rainin uibblers everywhere, like a flock of doves, smoking wit lames. Lovegood waves madly from the window.
_XENOPHILIUS LOVEGOOD
"Stop! I've got him --"
Lovegood is blasted off his feet by a Stunning Spell s reat the chain around his neck flies across the room an ettles at Harry's feet. Harry glances down, watches th ymbol of the Deathly Hallows dissolve like mercury, the ooks up, sees Lovegood streak out the door.
_HERMIONE
"Ron! Harry! Take my hand!"
Harry and Ron begin to crawl on their knees towar ermione when another volley of spells ricochet about th oom and -- ping! -- strike the Gurdyroot teapot. A ermione watches, it flies into the air, tumbling en ver end toward the Erumpent Horn. Harry's hand close n hers, Ron reaches out and.. .. the teapot strikes the Erumpent Horn.

154 EXT. LOVEGOOD HOUSE - CONTINUOUS ACTION - DUSK

There is a COLOSSAL EXPLOSION. The second floor of th lack cylinder ruptures. Quibblers belch into the ai ike confetti as Lovegood narrowly escapes and the Deat aters are engulfed and Harry, Ron and Hermione...

155 EXT. RIVERBANK - DUSK

... tumble INTO VIEW and roll to their feet, barel isible in the darkness.
_RON
"That treacherous old bleeder! Is there no one we can trust!"
(CONTINUED)


155 CONTINUED:

_HARRY
(softly)
_They've kidnapped Luna because he
 supported me. He was just
 desperate.
Ron says nothing, then SPITS, clearing the grit from hi eeth and peers toward the river. Unlike the ragin orce it was the last time they were here, it is littl ore than a trickle now. The trees are eerily quiet.
_RON
_I'll do the enchantments.
Ron takes out his wand... when Hermione raises her hand topping him. Her eyes rise. Her breath catches. Ro nd Harry look. Clinging to the branches of the tree bove, almost as if a part of the trees themselves re.. NATCHERS  wand BLOOMS above, illuminates the face of Scabior ermione's red scarf, now faded and filthy, dangles fro is neck. He presses it to his grimy nose, inhales an RINS.
_SCABIOR
_Hello, beautiful.

156 EXT. FOREST - DUSK (MOMENTS LATER)

Harry, Ron and Hermione DASH through the trees. As the iverge, we CUT BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN THE THREE ermione, swift as the wind, flickers through the tree s Scabior pursues her arry slashes through the river, looks up, and sees  natcher leap across the divide from one tree to another on pounds through thick brush, over a fallen tree he forest grows more dense, the shadows thicken. Spell plinter through the trees, ropes of light lace th ight ermione stumbles, regains her footing, finds herself i  clearing. Another figure pelts toward her: Harry CONTINUED)


156 CONTINUED:

They freeze briefly, then the clearing explodes wit ight as spells ricochet. They hit the ground. Hear th natchers closing in. Harry looks to Hermione. The TI f her WAND GLOWS and her face blooms in the darkness ooking mildly demonic. She reaches out, STRIPS HI LASSES FROM HIS FACE, then points her wand... at him.  URST of WHITE LIGHT strikes him in the eyes. As he and goes dark...

157 EXT. FORTRESS - NIGHT

... he is flying toward a fortress, gliding around th igh walls, up to the topmost window of the highes ower. He passes through the window -- little more tha  slit -- and...

158 INT. CELL - CONTINUOUS ACTION - NIGHT

... finds a SKELETAL FIGURE lying beneath a ragge lanket. The figure stirs, looks up, and grins wit roken teeth. It is the young man -- the thief -- grow ld. Grindelwald.
_GRINDELWALD
"Ah, Tom, I thought you would come one day. But surely you must know I no longer have what you seek..."
A SHADOW -- Voldemort's -- falls across Grindelwald.
_VOLDEMORT
"If not you, then who?"
_GRINDELWALD
"You're so innocent, Tom. Like a schoolboy. There's so much you don't understand..."
_VOLDEMORT
"Tell me, Grindelwald. Tell me where to find it! Tell me who possesses it! The name, Grindelwald! The name!"
_GRINDELWALD
"Can't you guess, Tom? It lies with him, of course. Buried within the earth. It is he who possesses it, even in death. Your old friend and mine... Dumbledore."


159 EXT. FOREST - DUSK

Harry blinks and IN A (SWOLLEN) BLUR peers at Hermione HISPERS QUICKLY:
_HARRY
"They exist. The Hallows."
Hermione looks at him expectantly. He nods, his FAC HROUDED IN SHADOW, BARELY VISIBLE.
_HARRY
"But he only wants the one, the last one. That's what he's been looking for."
_HERMIONE
"What're you saying?"
_HARRY
"He knows where it is, You-Know- Who. He'll have it by the end of the night. He's found the Elder Wand."
As Hermione stares in stunned disbelief, figures emerg rom the trees. Ron is shoved to the ground next t hem. Scabior strips Harry and Hermione of their wands.
_RON
"Don't touch her!"
A fist hits Ron hard. It's GREYBACK.
_HERMIONE
"Stop it!"
_SCABIOR
"Your boyfriend'll get worse than that if he doesn't behave, lovely."
Scabior paints her face with light then casts it o arry. Harry peers up, his eyes SWOLLEN to slits, hi ace HORRIBLY MISSHAPEN.
_SCABIOR
"What happened to you, ugly?"
Harry's hand finds his face, feels the lumps.
_SCABIOR
"What's your name?"
_HARRY
"Dudely. Vernon Dudley."

_SCABIOR
"Check the list. And you, ginger?"
_RON
"Stan Shunpike."
_SCABIOR
"Like `ell you are. We know skinny Stan. Try again."
Greyback, his boot to Ron's neck, presses harder.
_RON
"Weasley..."
(making it up)
"Barney Weasley."
_SCABIOR
"Weasley, eh? Wouldn't be related to that blood traitor Arthur Weasley, would you?"
_RON
"Piss off! Arthur Weasley's ten times the wizard you are!"
_SCABIOR
"Worth ten times you if I can find him. Wasn't you that tipped him off, was it?"
Ron stays mute. Scabior turns to Hermione.
_SCABIOR
"How `bout you, lovely? What do they call you...?"
_HERMIONE
"Penelope Clearwater. Half-blood."
Scabior strokes the nape of Hermione's neck, then take er hair in hand, sniffs it.
_SCABIOR
"You smell like vanilla, Penelope. I think you're going to be my favorite."
_SNATCHER
"There's no Vernon Dudley on `ere."
Reluctantly, Scabior turns from Hermione to Harry CONTINUED)

_FENRIR GREYBACK
"Hear that, ugly? The list says you're lying. How come you don't want us to know who you are? Hm?"
_HARRY
"The list is wrong. I told you who I am --"
Scabior puts a finger to his lips, silencing Harry, hi and probing Harry's face more closely.
_SCABIOR
"Change of plans, boys. We won't be taking this lot to the Ministry."

160 EXT. NIGHT SKY - NIGHT 160

The sea of treetops shift eerily below as we sweep ove hem.

161 EXT. MALFOY MANOR - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER)

Scabior and the others escort Harry, Ron and Hermion ast the yew hedges. Hermione eyes the white peacock ooking like a ghostly lawn ornament. Harry WHISPERS:
_HARRY
"What did you put on me?"
_HERMIONE
"A Stinging Jinx."
_HARRY
"How long will it last?"
_HERMIONE
"Not long."
Harry glances down, sees his GLASSES cupped in Hermione' alm. As he slips them into his pocket, the grou uddenly slows. Up ahead, on the other side of the gate ELLATRIX, LUCIUS and NARCISSA approach. Scabior grab arry's arm, pushes his face up to the iron bars ellatrix steps close.
_BELLATRIX
"Show me."
Scabior reaches out and pushes Harry's hair off hi orehead CONTINUED)
