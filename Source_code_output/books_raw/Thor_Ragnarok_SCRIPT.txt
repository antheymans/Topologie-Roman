THOR: RAGNAROK
THE MARVEL LOGO. SMOLDERING, BEGINNING TO TURN ORANGE IN TH EAT AS WE TILT UP TO SEE FIRE. NOTHING BUT FIRE.

2 INT. TIGHT SPACE - INDETERMINATE TIME

Dark and cramped. The soft red light of fire seeps throug ron slats. Inside this cage is a man, bound by chains t's THOR. His beard is long and his clothes are worn. Tha ough, grizzled look of a man who's spent years on the road e awakens with a JOLT. Looks around.
_THOR
"Now I know what you're thinking. Oh no! Thor's in a cage. How did this happen?"
(then:)
"Well, sometimes you have to get captured just to get a straight answer out of somebody. It's a long story but basically I'm a bit of a hero. See, I spent some time on earth, fought some robots, saved the planet a couple of times. Then I went searching through the cosmos for some magic, colorful Infinity Stone things... didn't find any. That's when I came across a path of death and destruction which led me all the way here into this cage... where I met you."
Reveal that he's talking to a weird alien skeleton in chains.
_THOR (CONT'D)
"How much longer do you think we'll be here?"
NOISE. Sounds of metal gears TURNING uddenly the bottom DROPS OUT! Thor PLUMMETS until - SHLINK hains CINCH and abruptly halt his descent. Thor dangles si eet off the ground. Pull back to reveal we are in-

3 INT. SURTUR'S LAIR - CONTINUOUS

A cavernous space. The walls, floors, and ceilings ar olten rock, which has creepy glimmers of fire within it tationed in the center is a volcanic rock throne, an itting in that throne is a charred demonic skeleton.
_SURTUR (O.S.)
"Thor, Son of Odin."
Thor's chain turns to reveal SURTUR on his throne. Eighteen-feet-tall, flesh made o ire, and demonic spiked horns on his skull.
_THOR
"Surtur. Son of a bitch...you're still alive! I thought my father killed you, like, half a million years ago."
_SURTUR
"I cannot die. Not until I fulfill my destiny and lay waste to your home."
_THOR
"You know, it's funny you should mention that because I've been having these terrible dreams of late. Asgard up in flames, falling to ruins, and you Surtur are at the center of all of them."
_SURTUR
"Then you have seen Ragnarok, the fall of Asgard. The great prophecy--"
_THOR (O.S.)
"Hang on. Hang on."
Reveal that Thor's chain is turning VERY SLOWLY.
_THOR (CONT'D)
"I'll be back around shortly. I really feel like we were connecting there."
After a beat, Thor rotates around to face Surtur.
_THOR (CONT'D)
"Okay, so, Ragnarok. Tell me about that. Walk me through it."
_SURTUR
"My time has come. When my crown is reunited with the Eternal Flame, I shall be restored to my full might. I will tower over the mountains and bury my sword deep in Asgard's--"
_THOR
"Oh, hang on. Give it a second."
Once again, Thor is turning VERY SLOWLY.
_THOR (CONT'D)
"I swear I'm not even moving, it's just doing this on its own. I'm really sorry."
(then:)
"Okay, let me get this straight. You're going to put your crown into the Eternal Flame, and then you'll suddenly grow as big as a house--"
_SURTUR
"A mountain!"
_THOR
"The Eternal Flame that Odin keeps locked away on Asgard?"
Surtur grins, evil.
_SURTUR
"Odin is not on Asgard. And your absence has left the throne defenseless."
That elicits a concerned look from Thor.
_THOR
"Okay, so where is it? This crown?"
_SURTUR
"This is my Crown, the source of my power."
Surtur points at the V-shaped horns on his head..
_THOR
"Oh, that's a crown? I thought it was a big eyebrow."
_SURTUR
"It's a crown."
_THOR
"Anyway, it sounds like all I have to do to stop Ragnarok is rip that thing off your head."
Surtur stands up and approaches Thor, DRAGGING his sword.
_SURTUR
"But Ragnarok has already begun. You cannot stop it. I am Asgard's doom, and so are you. All will suffer, all will burn."
Surtur steps forward and GRABS the chain above Thor's feet olding it so he and Thor are face to face.
_THOR
"That's intense. To be honest, seeing you grow really big and set fire to a planet would be quite the spectacle. But it looks like I'm going to have to go with option B where I bust out of these chains, knock that tiara off your head, and stash it away in Asgard's vault."
_SURTUR
"You cannot stop Ragnarok. Why fight it?"
Behind his back, Thor opens his hand. Sending out the SOS.
_THOR
"Because that's what heroes do."
Nothing happens. Thor appears annoyed at himself.
_THOR (CONT'D)
"Wait, sorry. I didn't time that right."
(pause)
"And, now!"
BOOM! Thor's hammer Mjolnir CRASHES through the wall hor BREAKS FREE from his chains, GRABS Mjolnir, spins, an lies a distance away. He FLINGS Mjolnir back at Surtur mashing the giant in the face. Mjolnir returns.
_SURTUR
"You have made a grave mistake, Odinson."
THE WALLS COME ALIVE! A seemingly infinite swarm of FIR EMONS rally to Surtur's aid.
_THOR
"I make grave mistakes all the time. Everything seems to work out."
In the shadows, a massive FIRE DRAGON ROARS he fire demons SURGE FORWARD. Thor backs up, HAMMERIN WAY. He then leaps back, SPRINGBOARDS off the wall, and LANDS HARD, SLAMMING Mjolnir down. The resulting shockwav NOCKS BACK THE LEGION OF FIRE DEMONS he Fire Dragon STRAINS against a chain leash hor is now facing off with Surtur. Surtur thrusts his hand t Thor, generating a humongous PROJECTILE WALL OF FIRE hor SPINS Mjolnir so fast that it creates a kind of SHIELD he God of Thunder and the Fire Giant engage in ferociou and-to-hand combat. Each landing power shots, sendin parks of both fire and electricity into the air hor SLIPS behind Surtur and TAKES OUT his knees. Thor the AUNCHES HIGH into the air and summons a HUGE LIGHTNING BOLT escending hard, he uses all his power to LOP SURTUR'S HEAD OFF OF HIS BODY! Surtur's body DEFLATE nd COLLAPSES into a heap of charred bones hor straps the crowned skull to his back. He turns to find the army of Fire Demons regrouping as reinforcements floo n, filling the space to capacity. Recognizing the threat hor thrusts Mjolnir above his head.
_THOR (CONT'D)
"Heimdall. I know it's been a while, but I could use a fast exit!"
Nothing. Thor just stands there as the Fire Demons advance.
_THOR (CONT'D)
 ...Heimdall?

4 INT. THE OBSERVATORY - SAME

Heimdall is nowhere to be found. Instead, we meet SKURGE e's bald, strong, mean looking, a little eager to be liked t the moment, Skurge is entertaining two ASGARDIAN WOMEN.
_SKURGE
"Heimdall was an idiot. This job should have made him rich. Now, the job ain't easy, but it does have its benefits. The Bi-Frost gives me access to everything the Nine Realms have to offer. I mean it's all mine for the taking."
(beat)
"Behold...my stuff."
Skurge has drawn their attention to a pile of weapons an reasures he has stashed off to the side e hefts up two M-16 assault rifles, trying to play it cool.
_SKURGE (CONT'D)
"I'm particularly fond of these. I pulled `em out of a place on Midgard called Texas. I even named them. Des and Troy. You see, when you put them together...they destroy."

5 INT. SURTUR'S LAIR - CONTINUOUS

Having expected to have been Bi-Frosted out of there, Thor i VERRUN BY THE GIANT WAVE OF FIRE DEMONS he Fire Dragon BREAKS FREE of its chain ealizing he's in trouble, Thor TAKES OFF, rocketing up to-

Thor CRASHES out of the ground and LANDS on a craggy surface isoriented and singed from the fire demon onslaught hor's cloak is on fire, and he frantically PATS OUT th lames. He picks up Mjolnir, holds it up once more. Nothing.
_THOR
"Heimdall, come on."
THE GROUND SHAKES! Like an earthquake. Thor backs up as th round begins to give way all around him. And then THE FEARSOME FIRE DRAGON BURSTS OUT OF THE GROUND! Th ragon opens its tremendous jaws for an ear-splitting roar.. ..but Thor STUFFS Mjolnir into its mouth and lets go HUD! The hammer DROPS, pinning the beast down by its botto aw. It THRASHES and GROWLS, trying to break free.
_THOR (CONT'D)
"Stay."
(looks up to the sky:)
"I'm running short on--"
Thor notices that all around him the ground is CRUMBLING lik  field of sinkholes giving way to more snarling Fire Demons!
_THOR (CONT'D)
"-options."
Thor calls for Mjolnir and TAKES OFF. The dragon SCREECHES!

9 INT. THE OBSERVATORY - SAME

Skurge continues showing off for the ladies.
_THOR (O.S.)
"Heimdall?"
Behind Skurge the Bi-Frost starts MOVING. One of the wome otices the Bi-Frost glowing.
_ASGARDIAN WOMAN
"Skurge, is that important?"
Skurge turns and notices the Bi-Frost activity.
_SKURGE
"You girls are in for a treat."
Angle on Heimdall's sword, which has been sloppily cast asid n another pile of "stuff." Skurge hastily runs and grabs it.

10 EXT. MUSPELHEIM - CONTINUOUS 10

Thor is FLYING at top speed, but that dragon is right on hi eels! The fire demons LAUNCH flaming projectiles from below hor looks back, genuinely nervous.

Tho eanwhile is clean and staggering back to his feet. He look p to Skurge, who is wiping dragon guts off of himself.
_SKURGE
"Girls!"
(beat)
"Well well, look who decided to pop in. Thanks for scaring away my company and drenching my workplace in brains."
_THOR
"Who are you?"
_SKURGE
"Don't you remember? I'm Skurge."
(Thor doesn't)
"We fought together on Vanaheim."
_THOR
"Right. Where's Heimdall?"
_SKURGE
"That traitor. No one knows, he's a fugitive of the throne."
_THOR
"Traitor?"
_SKURGE
"Yeah, you see, Odin charged Heimdall with negligence of duty, but he disappeared before the trial. Hard to catch a guy who can see everything in the Universe."
Thor starts to say something, but then gives up. Instead h tarts towards the exit... but Skurge stands in his way.
_THOR
"Sure."
_SKURGE
"Hold on. I'm supposed to announce your arrival."
Thor SPINS UP Mjolnir and takes off in a blur. Skurge start he loooong run down the Rainbow Bridge XT.

_THOR
"What the hell is that?"

13 EXT. ASGARD - ROYAL TERRACE - PATIO - MOMENTS LATER

LOKI falls into frame, GASPING FOR BREATH... although it' ot Loki. This is ACTOR LOKI and we're watching a STAGE PLAY n the background, a single musician plays the haunting scor rom THOR: THE DARK WORLD on a pan flute uddenly, ACTOR THOR leans into shot, holding Actor Loki.
_ACTOR LOKI
"Oh, brother. This is it. I take my leave."
_ACTOR THOR
"You fool, you didn't listen!"
_ACTOR LOKI
"I'm sorry."
_ACTOR THOR
"Lady Sif! Get help! Sif" awkwardly runs off. The "Warriors Three" watch sadly. A
small choir JOINS IN as the music builds to a CRESCENDO.
_ACTOR SIF
"Somebody help!"
In the middle of the audience we reveal ODIN, sitting upon  haise lounge, sipping wine and thoroughly enjoying the show nseen, Thor arrives behind the audience and watches.
_ACTOR LOKI
"Sorry for all I've done."
_ACTOR THOR
"It's all right. Hold on."
_ACTOR LOKI
"I'm sorry I tried to rule Earth."
_ACTOR THOR
"They'd be lucky to have you."
_ACTOR LOKI
"I'm sorry about that thing with the Tesseract. I just couldn't help myself."
_ACTOR THOR
"I know."
_ACTOR LOKI
"I'm a trickster."
_ACTOR THOR
"So mischievous."
_ACTOR LOKI
"Sorry about that time I turned you into a frog."
_ACTOR THOR
"It was a wonderful joke."
_ODIN
(to no-one in particular)
"Twas indeed hilarious."
_ACTOR THOR
"You are the savior of Asgard."
_ACTOR LOKI
"Tell my story."
_ACTOR THOR
"I will."
_ACTOR LOKI
"Build a statue for me."
_ACTOR THOR
"We will build a big statue for you."
_ACTOR LOKI
"With my helmet on, with the big bendy horns."
_ACTOR THOR
"I will tell Father what you did here today."
Odin mouths Actor Loki's final line along with him.
_ACTOR LOKI
"I didn't do it for him."
Actor Loki then "dies".
_ACTOR THOR
"Noooooo!!!"
The brothers freeze in a TABLEAU as ACTOR ODIN steps forward.
_ACTOR ODIN
"And so Loki died of his wounds, giving his life for ours. He fought back those disgusting dark elves. He brought peace to the realm."
He takes a 4-YEAR-OLD BOY, PAINTED BLUE, into his arms.
_ACTOR ODIN (CONT'D)
"Loki, my boy...`Twas many moons ago I found you on a frost-bitten battlefield."
Thor watches, incredulous. He then notices that a woman nex o him is openly SOBBING at the play.
_ACTOR ODIN (CONT'D)
"On that day, I did not yet see in you Asgard's savior. No. You were merely a little blue baby icicle... that melted this old fool's heart."
The crowd erupts in rapturous applause. The players bow. Odi tands up, leading the crowd in this STANDING OVATION.
_ODIN
"Bravo! Bravo! Well done. Bravo."
_THOR
"Father."
Odin sees Thor taking a knee. Curses under his breath:
_ODIN
"Oh, shit."
(then, announcing)
"My son! Thor has returned! Greetings my boy."
Odin goes through a weird internal transformation. Hi luidity is replaced by a rigid and regal posture. He bat way his maiden and turns to Thor, who stands up.
_THOR
"It's an interesting play. What's it called?"
_ODIN
"The Tragedy of Loki of Asgard. The people wanted to commemorate him."
_THOR
"Indeed they should."
(provoking)
"I like that statue. A lot better looking than he was when he was alive, though. A little less weasely. Less greasy maybe."
Odin sours, masking his agitation. Thor holds up the skull.
_THOR (CONT'D)
"You know what this is?"
_ODIN (ADR)
"The skull of Surtur? That's a formidable weapon."
Thor approaches an E-Guard and hands it over.
_THOR
"Do me a favor. Lock this in a vault so it doesn't turn into a giant monster and destroy the whole planet."
_ODIN
"So it's back to Midgard for you, is it?"
Thor starts YO-YOing Mjolnir, turns back to Odin.
_THOR
"Nope. I've been having this reocurring dream lately."
(MORE)
_THOR (CONT'D)
"Every night I see Asgard fall into ruins..."
_ODIN
"That's just a silly dream... Signs of an overactive imagination."
_THOR
"Possibly... but then I decide to go out there and investigate. And what do I find, but the Nine Realms completely in chaos. Enemies of Asgard assembling, plotting our demise, all while you, Odin, the protector of those Nine Realms, are sitting here in your bathrobe, eating grapes."
_ODIN
"Well, it is best to respect our neighbors' freedom."
_THOR
"Of course, the freedom to be massacred."
_ODIN
"Yes, besides, I have been rather busy myself."
_THOR
"Watching theatre."
_ODIN
"Board meetings, and security council meetings..."
_THOR
"You really going to make me do it?"
_ODIN
"Do what?"
Thor SPINS Mjolnir and then HURLS it off into the distance RABS Odin by the back of the neck din's royal attendants GASP in shock. The Einherja odyguards rush Thor, but he KICKS them away.
_THOR
"You know that nothing will stop Mjolnir as it returns to my hand."
Mjolnir stops mid-air and starts ROCKETING BACK.
_THOR (CONT'D)
"Not even your face."
_ODIN
"You've gone quite mad. You'll be executed for this!"
Mjolnir approaches at a terrifying speed as Odin struggles.
_THOR
"Then I'll see you on the other side...brother."
The jig is up. A shimmering illusion dissipates, revealing:
_LOKI
"Alright, I yield!"
Thor DROPS Loki to the ground and catches Mjolnir. Lok ooks to Thor, hands up defensively. Skurge arrives on th cene, a little late to warn Loki.
_SKURGE
"Behold! Thor..Odinson."
_LOKI
"You had one job! Just the one."
_THOR
"Where's Odin?"
_LOKI
"You just couldn't stay away, could you? Everything was fine without you. Asgard was prospering"
(gestures to the crowd)
"You've ruined everything. Ask them."
Those who aren't freaked out are becoming gradually angrier hor advances on Loki, who backs up onto the chaise lounge.
_THOR
"Where's father? Did you kill him?"
_LOKI
"You had what you wanted, you had the independence you asked for!"
Thor PRESSES Mjolnir onto Loki's chest.
_LOKI (CONT'D)
"Ow-ow-ow! Alright! I know exactly where he is."

17 EXT. SHADY ACRES NURSING HOME - MANHATTAN - DAY

A NURSING HOME sign on a brick wall. Suddenly the wal rumbles out of shot, revealing a demolition site eveal Thor and Loki wearing street clothes. Thor carries a mbrella, Loki is dressed in a weird avant-garde suit.
_LOKI
"I swear, I left him right here."
_THOR
"Right here on the sidewalk? Or right there, where the building that's being demolished? Great planning."
_LOKI
"How was I supposed to know? Can't see into the future. I'm not a witch."
_THOR
"Then why do you dress like one?"
_LOKI
"Hey."
_THOR
"I can't believe you're alive. I saw you die. I mourned you, I cried for you."
_LOKI
"I'm honored."
_COLLEGE GIRL
"Ask him."
_COLLEGE GIRL
"Hi. Would you mind taking a picture with us?"
_THOR
"Sure."
(to Loki:)
"Start figuring out where he is."
_COLLEGE GIRL
"Oh, my god."
_COLLEGE GIRL
"Sorry to hear that Jane dumped you."
_THOR
"She didn't dump me, you know. I dumped her. It was a mutual dumping."
Thor notices something going on around Loki.
_THOR (CONT'D)
"What's this, what are you doing!?"
Loki looks down to see that the sidewalk has started to GLO ENEATH HIM! A circle of ancient symbols.
_LOKI
"This... isn't me."
WHOOMPF! Loki DROPS out of sight, vanishing through soli oncrete! Thor sees a CARD on the sidewalk where Loki was hor pokes the business card.
_THOR
"Loki?"
He picks up the card. It reads:
 177A Bleecker Street
Thor picks up the card and - WHOOSH!

18 EXT. SANCTUM SANTORUM - DAY

Thor approaches 177A Bleecker Street e knocks ONCE, TWICE, and then WHOOSH!

19 INT. SANCTUM SANCTORUM UPSTAIRS PARLOR - CONTINUOUS

Thor is suddenly inside Doctor Strange's lair!
_STRANGE (O.S.)
"Thor Odinson."
From a dark corner we glimpse a shape - DOCTOR STRANGE evitating, he drifts towards Thor.
_STRANGE (CONT'D)
"God of Thunder."
Thor holds up the ratty umbrella, ready to defend himself.
_STRANGE (CONT'D)
"You can put down the umbrella."
Thor gives Strange a sideways look but then sets his umbrell own. When he looks back up, the environment is furnished.
_THOR
"So earth has wizards now?"
_STRANGE
"The preferred term is "Master of the Mystic Arts.""
_THOR
"Alright wizard, who are you? Why should I care?"
_STRANGE
"My name is Doctor Stephen Strange and I have some questions for you. Take a seat."
Thor and Strange are now sitting in high-backed chairs.
_STRANGE (CONT'D)
"Tea?"
Thor now has a cup of tea in his hand.
_THOR
"I don't drink tea."
_STRANGE
"What do you drink?"
_THOR
"Not tea."
Thor now has a stein of beer in his hand. He drinks i hroughout the scene, but it always stays full.
"STRANGE"
So I keep a watch list o ndividuals and beings from othe ealms that may be a threat to thi orld. Your adopted brother Lok s one of these beings.
"THOR"
He's a worthy inclusion.
"STRANGE"
Then why bring him here?
"THOR"
We're looking for my father.
"STRANGE"
So. If you were to tell you wher din was, all parties concerne ould promptly return to Asgard?
"THOR"
Promptly.
"DR. STRANGE"

"THOR"
No. What for beat nyway, my father is no longer i xile. So if you could tell m here he is, I can take him home.
_DR. STRANGE
"Gladly. He's in Norway."
Strange stands up and suddenly they are standing by a book ase. Strange takes down an ancient book, flips through it.
_STRANGE
"I'm just seeing whether this incantation requires any Asgardian modifications."
Thor reaches out to the bookcase to steady himself.
_STRANGE (CONT'D)
"Nope."
Suddenly they are both across the room at Strange's wor tation. Because Thor was touching the bookcase, he ha agically brought it across the room as well.
_STRANGE (CONT'D)
"Oh, we don't need that."
Suddenly Thor is back across the room. Books fall off th helf and Thor's beer spills e is queasy and unsteady from the teleporting.
_THOR
"Will you stop doing that?"
_STRANGE
"I need just one strand of your hair."
_THOR
"Let me explain something, my hair is not to be meddled wi-!"
Strange is behind Thor, he plucks a strand of hair trange extends the hair, infuses it with magic, does a fe estures that create a BRIGHT LIGHT and suddenly 20 INT. SANCTUM SANCTORUM - FRONT STAIRCASE - CONTINUOUS A2 ottom of the stairs. Strange is standing. Thor is rollin own the stairs. A magic portal leading into a peacefu eadow has opened beside Strange.
_THOR
"We could have just walked."
_DR. STRANGE
(re: the portal)
"He's waiting for you."
_THOR
"All right."
_STRANGE
"Don't forget your umbrella."
_THOR
"Yes."
Thor extends his arm and holds out his hand. Crashing noise re heard. Lots of crashing noises.
_THOR (CONT'D)
"Sorry"
Finally the umbrella flies into his hand.
_THOR (CONT'D)
"I suppose I'll need my brother back."
_DR. STRANGE
"Yeah, right."
Suddenly we hear SCREAMING rom above, LOKI drops out of a portal. He LANDS HARD on th loor and then STAGGERS to his feet. On edge, confused.
_LOKI
 ...I have been falling...for thirty
"minutes!"
_DR. STRANGE
(to Thor:)
"You can handle him from here."
_THOR
"Yeah of course."
(they shake hands)
"Thank you very much for your help."
_STRANGE
"Good luck."
_LOKI
"Handle me? Who are you?"
_THOR
"Loki."
Loki DRAWS a dagger, ready to attack Strange.
_LOKI
 ..you think you're some kind of
"sorcerer? Don't think for one minute, you second-rate..."
_DR. STRANGE
"Bye-bye."
Strange GESTURES with both hands and WHOOSH! PULLS the magic portal over them ust like that, Thor and Loki are gone.

21 EXT. CLIFFS - DAY

Beautiful, undisturbed nature. We hear the ocean nearby OKI lands on the ground, portal closes behind them.
_THOR
"Father?"
A lone figure stands at the other side of the meadow at th liff's edge, waves CRASHING below t is ODIN. He's dressed plainly in humble human clothes he boys approach him quickly.
_ODIN
"Look at this place. It's beautiful."
_THOR
"Father, it's us."
_ODIN
"My sons. I've been waiting for you."
Loki is surprised to hear Odin call him his son.
_THOR
"I know. We've come to take you home."
_ODIN
"Home, yes. Your mother, she calls me. Do you hear it?"
Thor fires a look at Loki, who holds up his hands in defense.
_THOR
"Loki, lift your magic."
Odin turns to Loki, who stiffens. But Odin smiles.
_ODIN
"Took me quite a while to break free from your spell. Frigga would have been proud."
Loki is moved by this gesture. He looks over to see Tho taring at him, anger building din puts a hand on Thor's shoulder, calming him.
_ODIN (CONT'D)
"Come and sit with me. I don't have much time."
Odin sits, out of breath, weak. His sons sit beside him.
_THOR
"I know that we failed you, but we can make this right."
_ODIN
"I failed you."
(beat)
"It is upon us...Ragnarok."
_THOR
"No, I've stopped Ragnarok. I put an end to Surtur."
_ODIN
"No. It has already begun. She's coming. My life was all that held her back, but my time has come. I cannot keep her away any longer."
_THOR
"Father, who are you talking about?"
_ODIN
"The Goddess of Death. Hela. My first born."
(faces Thor)
"Your sister."
That hits Thor hard. Loki can't believe what he's hearing.
_THOR
 ...what?
_ODIN
"Her violent appetites grew beyond my control. I couldn't stop her, so I imprisoned her. Locked her away. She draws her strength from Asgard...and once she gets there, her powers will be limitless."
_THOR
"Whatever she is, we can stop her. We can face her together."
_ODIN
(takes Thor's hand)
"No we won't. I'm on a different path now. This you must face alone."
Odin looks into Thor's eyes, struggling to breathe.
_ODIN (CONT'D)
"I love you my sons."
For the briefest of instances, father and sons share a quie oment together. Tears well in Thor's eyes.
_ODIN (CONT'D)
"Look at that."
Ethereal sun-rays stream down upon the ocean.
_ODIN (CONT'D)
"Remember this place. Home."
A warm glow washes over Thor's face and he turns to see that ODIN IS DISSIPATING INTO STARDUST. THE ALLFATHER HAS DIED  moment as the brothers separately mourn for Odin he sky above DARKENS and THE WIND PICKS UP hor stands and turns toward Loki, his eyes burning wit age. Loki takes a step back.
_LOKI
"Brother."
Thor faces Loki. Electricity CRACKLES at Thor's hands.
_THOR
"This was your doing."
CRACK! Behind them a black portal SPLITS OPEN hor SLAMS DOWN his umbrella, transforming into his Asgardia rmor (with Mjolnir). Loki changes into his armor as well  piercing scream cuts the air as a figure is hurtled out o he portal, crashing out of this dimensional rift is HELA ela takes a second to consider her surroundings. Then:
_HELA
"So he's gone?"
(beat)
"That's a shame. I would've liked to have seen that."
A tense moment as they stare each other down.
_THOR
"You must be Hela. I'm Thor, son of Odin."
_HELA
"Really, you don't look like him."
_LOKI
"Perhaps we can reach an arrangement."
_HELA
"You sound like him."
Loki shifts nervously. Thor's grip tightens on Mjolnir.
_HELA (CONT'D)
"Kneel."
_LOKI
"Beg your pardon?"
Hela MANIFESTS a pitch black blade.
_HELA
"Kneel...before your Queen."
_THOR
"I don't think so."
Thor winds up and HURLS Mjolnir at Hela..  THUD - the mighty hammer comes to a cold stop, agains ela's hand hor is shocked. He stretches out his hands, trying to cal jolnir back to him he hammer trembles in Hela's hand, like a mini game of tug-o ar. But ultimately Hela keeps possession.
_THOR (CONT'D)
"It's not possible."

"We were once the seat of absolute power in the Cosmos. Our supremacy was unchallenged, yet Odin stopped at Nine Realms. Our destiny is to rule over all others. And I am here to restore that power. Kneel before me...and rise into the ranks of my great conquest."
THE E-GUARDS GET INTO ATTACK FORMATION.

"Fear not, for you are found. You are home, and there is no going back. No one leaves this place."
Thor STRUGGLES against his restraints.
_SOOTHING VOICE (V.O.)
"But what is this place? The answer in Sakaar."
The tunnel walls show images of Sakaar's place in the Cosmos.
_SOOTHING VOICE (V.O.)
"Surrounded by cosmic gateways, Sakaar lives on the edge of the known and unknown."
Images of the wormholes that cover Sakaar's atmosphere.

(to Topaz:)
"Whenever we get to talking, Topaz, about Scrapper 142...what do I always say? "She is the..." and it starts with a B."
_TOPAZ
"Trash."
_GRANDMASTER
"No, not trash. Were you waiting just to call her that? It doesn't start with a "B.""
_TOPAZ
"Booze hag."
_GRANDMASTER
"I'm so sorry. No, "best." I was thinking about "best.""
(to S142:)
"Because I always say you're the best. She brought me my precious beloved Champion, you know."
_TOPAZ

"No, I got paid for this."
Thor claws at the obedience disk, trying to RIP IT OUT e gets some separation from his skin, but the disk i ausing him even more pain. Thor eventually has to let go randmaster holds up HIS OWN fob device and uses it like  and to guide Thor's HOVER CHAIR, which follows Grandmaste round as he speaks.
_GRANDMASTER
"Here's what I wanna know. Who are you?"
_THOR
"I am the God of THUNDER!!!"
Thor THRUSTS his arms into the air but only a tiny bit o tatic electricity POPS within Thor's hands.
_GRANDMASTER
"Wow. I didn't hear any thunder, but out of your fingers, was that like...sparkles?"
_TOPAZ
"We located your cousin."
_GRANDMASTER
"Oh good!"
(to Thor:)
"Yeah, come on. I think you're gonna like this."
Grandmaster moves Thor's chair to another section where COUSIN CARLO is waiting. He's strapped to a chair lik hor, and he is terrified.
_GRANDMASTER (CONT'D)
"There he is. Hey, cuz. We almost couldn't find you. What, have you been hiding?"
Cousin Carlo looks at Thor, cowering in fear.

"Oh, the smell."
_GRANDMASTER
"What does it smell like?"
_TOPAZ
"Burnt toast."
_GRANDMASTER
"What happened to my manners? I haven't properly introduced myself. Come on. Follow me."
Grandmaster gives Topaz back her staff randmaster and Thor arrive at a space where A GROUP O USICIANS PLAY STRANGE INSTRUMENTS (the source of the musi hus far). Grandmaster joins them, still speaking to Thor randmaster begins PLAYING a strange piano-like contraption iffing a melody over the existing music.
_GRANDMASTER (CONT'D)
"My name is Grandmaster. I preside over a little harlequinade called the Contest of Champions. People come from far and wide to unwillingly participate in it. And you, my friend, might just be part of the new cast. What do you say to that?"
_THOR
"We're not friends, and I don't give a shit about your games! I'm going back to Asgard!"
_GRANDMASTER
(amused)
"Ass-gard?"
(then:)
"One, two, three, four."
Grandmaster really gets into his PLAYING. Grandmaster' uards and VIP guests start MOVING TO THE MUSIC hor takes a moment to look around at this bizarre spectacl nfolding around him. In doing so, he zeroes in on on articular group of VIPS, specifically.. ..LOKI! He's lounging and dressed in Sakaarian garb.
_LOKI
"There was a wormhole in space and time beneath me. At that moment, I let go."
_THOR
"Loki!? Loki! Over here!"
Loki notices Thor. Blanches a little. Sidles closer so a o speak to Thor without looking like he's speaking to Thor.
_LOKI
"Excuse me one second."
_THOR
"Loki!"
Loki hustles over to Thor, SHUSHING him.
_LOKI
"What? You're alive?"
_THOR
"Yes, of course I'm alive."
_LOKI
"What are you doing here?"
_THOR
"What do you mean, what am I doing? I'm stuck in this stupid chair. Where's your chair?"
_LOKI
"I didn't get a chair."
_THOR
"Get me out of this one."
_LOKI
"I can't."
_THOR
"What?"
_LOKI
"I've made friends with this man. He's called the Grandmaster."
_THOR
"Oh, he's crazy!"
_LOKI
"I've gained his favor.. The Bi- Frost brought me out here weeks ago."
_THOR
"Weeks ago? I just got here."
Suddenly Grandmaster is right next to them.
_GRANDMASTER
"What are you whispering about?"
Both Thor and Loki react, startled.
_GRANDMASTER (CONT'D)
"Time works real different around these parts."
(MORE)
_GRANDMASTER (CONT'D)
"On any other world, I'd be like, millions of years old. But here on Sakaar..."
Grandmaster beholds himself. Then turns to Loki. A trul ncomfortable silence.
_GRANDMASTER (CONT'D)
"In any case, you know this... You call yourself Lord of Thunder?"
_THOR
"God of Thunder. Tell him."
_LOKI
"I've never met this man in my life."
_THOR
"He's my brother."
_LOKI
"Adopted."
_GRANDMASTER
"Is he any kind of a fighter?"
Loki shrugs, gives the universal gesture for "so-so."
_THOR
"You take this thing out of my neck and I'll show you."
_GRANDMASTER
"Now listen to that. He's threatening me. Hey, Sparkles, here's the deal. If you wanna get back to Ass-place, Assberg..."
_THOR
"Asgard."
_GRANDMASTER
"Any contender who defeats my champion, their freedom they shall win."
_THOR
"Fine. Then point me in the direction of whoever's ass I have to kick."
_GRANDMASTER
"That's what I call, contender! Direction would be this way, Lord."
_THOR
"Loki!"
Guards arrive. They haul Thor up and escort him out.

34 INT. THE ARENA - GLADIATOR CELLS - NIGHT

Thor is shoved into a spacious cell where other alie risoners are lurking in the back he thick cell door SLAMS SHUT behind Thor. Thor gets up an mmediately begins THROWING his shoulder into the door. Th oor doesn't budge, not even a little ehind him, KORG, a hulking Kronan rock alien, speaks up.
_KORG
"Hey! Take it easy man!"
(Thor looks back)
"Over here. The pile of rocks waving at you. Yeah I'm actually a thing, I'm a being. Allow me to introduce myself, my name is Korg. I'm kind of like the leader in here. I'm made of rocks, as you can see, but don't let that intimidate you. You don't need to be afraid unless you're made of scissors."
(GIGGLES to himself)
"Just a little rock-paper-scissor joke for you. This is my very good friend over here, Miek. He's an insect and has knives for hands."
MIEK, a slug alien inside a robot exoskeleton, says hello b oing some karate moves.
_THOR
"You're a Kronan, aren't you?"
_KORG
"That I am."
_THOR
"How'd you end up in here?"
_KORG
"Well, I tried to start a revolution but didn't print enough pamphlets, so hardly anyone turned up."
(MORE)
_KORG (CONT'D)
"Except for my mom and her boyfriiend, who I hate. As punishment, I was forced to be in here and become a gladiator. Bit of a promotional disaster."
(secretive)
"But I'm actually organizing another revolution. I don't know if you'd be interested in something like that. Do you reckon you'd be interested?"
Thor tries to run ahead down the circle and loops back aroun ehind Korg.
_THOR
"How did you..."
_KORG
"Yeah, no. This whole thing is a circle. But not a real circle, more like a freaky circle."
_THOR
"This doesn't make any sense."
_KORG
"No, nothing makes sense here. The only thing that does make sense, is that nothing makes sense."
_THOR
"Has anyone here fought the Grandmaster's Champion?"
_KORG
"Doug has. Doug!"
(realizes)
"Oh, right, Doug's dead. That's right. Everyone who fights the Grandmaster's champion perishes."
_THOR
"What about you? You're made of rocks."
_KORG
"Perishable rocks."
(a pebble FALLS OFF)
"There you go. Another one gone. Yeah, no, I just do the smaller fights, warm up the crowd and whatnot. Wait. You're not gonna face him, are you?"
_THOR
"Yes I am. Fight him, win, and get the hell out of this place."
_KORG
"That's exactly what Doug used to say. See you later, new Doug."

"Say something!"
Thor finally looks right at Loki, speaks fast and curt:

"Yeah, not really useful unless you're fighting off three vampires that were huddled together."
_THOR
"I really wish I had my hammer."
_KORG
"Hammer?"
_THOR
"Quite unique. It was made from this special metal from the heart of a dying star. And when I spun it really, really fast it gave me the ability to fly."
_KORG
"You rode a hammer?"
_THOR
"No, I didn't ride the hammer."
_KORG
"The hammer rode you on your back?"
_THOR
"No. I used to spin it really fast, and it would pull me off the..."
_KORG
"Oh my God. The hammer pulled you off?"
_THOR
"The ground. It would pull me off the ground, up into the air, and I would fly. Every time I threw it, it would always come back to me."
_KORG
"Sounds like you had a pretty special and intimate relationship wiht this hammer and that losing it was almost comparable to losing a loved one."
_THOR
"That's a nice way of putting it."
Thor spots
dealing at the bar. He's once again eyein he fob device clipped to her belt. Scowls.
_SCRAPPER #142
"I said they're mine."
_THOR
"See her, the one that put me in here."
_KORG
"Yeah, Scrapper"
She's strong And she drinks a lot."
(MORE)
_KORG (CONT'D)
"Gotta watch out for those Asgardians, man. They are hard to perish."
_THOR
"Asgardian?"
Thor breaks away from the line and runs to
_THOR (CONT'D)
"Hey! Hey!"
S142 holds up the fob.
_THOR (CONT'D)
"Do not zap me with that thing. I just wanna talk. Asgard is in danger."
Thor then notices a series of PATTERNED SCARS, or BRANDS, o er forearms. It's a moment of recognition and disbelief.
_THOR (CONT'D)
"My God, you're a Valkyrie. I used to wanna be a Valkyrie when I was younger...until I found out that you were all women. There's nothing wrong with women, of course. I love women. Sometimes a little too much. Not in a creepy way, just more of a respectful appreciation. I think it's great that there is an elite force of women warriors. It's about time."
_SCRAPPER #142
"Are you done?"
_WARDEN (O.S.)
"Lord of Thunder, you're up."
_THOR
"Please, help me. I need your help."
_SCRAPPER #142
"Bye."
_THOR
"Fine, then you must be a traitor or a coward because the Valkyrie are sworn to protect the throne."
S142 finally turns her attention to Thor, intense.
_SCRAPPER #142
"Listen closely, your majesty. This is Sakaar, not Asgard. And I'm a scrapper, not a Valkyrie."
Guards swarm Thor, dragging him back
_WARDEN (O.S.)
"Bring him in for processing!"
_VALKYRIE
"And no one escapes this place. So you're gonna die anyway."
Despite her denial, Thor has clearly hit a nerve. And fro ow on we will refer to Scrapper #142 as VALKYRIE alkyrie takes her booze and walks away. Thor is dragge way, passing Korg and the other prisoners.

_HELA
"Tell me about yourself, Skurge."

"Well, me dad was a stonemason, me mum was-"

_SKURGE
"I just want a chance to prove myself."
_HELA
"Recognition."

Thor's eyes POP OPEN. He's lying in a heap on the ground till dirty, bruised, and beat up hor is being tended to by TWO SAKAARIAN GLADIATOR NURSES wh re swabbing his wounds. This freaks him out, which result n startled thrashing. That freaks out the two Gladiato urses, which results in them RUNNING AWAY hor starts to get up, but then winces. He moves slowly e's in a GIANT ROOM with stark graphic patterns on th alls. With a few achy grimaces, Thor stands up and wander round. There's furniture, large cushions, and a sleepin rea enclosed by the SKULL of a giant beast OISE behind him. Thor follows the noise to find ulk having eased himself into a large steaming JACUZZI. Tho ooks at him quizzically. Hulk isn't angry. He's RELAXED ut he's not turning into Banner.
_THOR
"Are we cool?"
Hulk grunts. I guess so.
_THOR (CONT'D)
"It's Hulk in a hot tub."
(then:)
"How long have you been like that?"
_HULK
"Like what?"
_THOR
"Like this. Big, green, ...stupid."
_HULK
"Hulk always Hulk."
Thor takes this in, and then walks over to a window tha ooks out across the city. Does some spatial math, realizes hor looks back out the window e sees a ramshackle SPACESHIP taking off and ROCKETIN kyward. Higher and higher, it's going for a wormhole when BOOM! One of Grandmaster's Palace Patrol ships, more moder nd heavy duty, BLOWS it out of the sky n Thor, wheels turning. He turns to Hulk.
_THOR
"How'd you get here?"
_HULK
"Winning."
_THOR
"You mean cheating?"
(re: Obedience Disk MORE)
_THOR (CONT'D)
"Were they wearing one of these when you won? How'd you arrive here?"
_HULK
"Quinjet."
Hulk mimes a plane landing in the water.
_THOR
"Yes. Where is the Quinjet now?"
Hulk stands up, and exits the hot tub, naked.
_THOR (CONT'D)
"That's naked. He's very naked. It's in my brain now."
Hulk points out the window.
_HULK
"Quinjet."
Thor sees the Quinjet in a massive alien junkyard.
_THOR
"Yes! I'm getting us out of here. This is a terrible, awful place. You're gonna love Asgard. It's big. It's golden. Shiny."
Hulk sits on his bed, eating a pumpkin.
_HULK
"Hulk stay."
_THOR
"No, no, no. My people need me to get back to Asgard. We must prevent Ragnarok."
_HULK
"Rag-na-ruh?"
_THOR
"The prophesied death of my home world, the end of days, it's the end of-"
(Hulk's blank stare)
"If you help me get back to Asgard, I can help you get back to Earth."
_HULK
"Earth hate Hulk."
_THOR
"Earth loves Hulk. They love you. You're of the Avengers. One of the team, one of our friends. This is what friends do. They support each other."
_HULK
"You're Banner's friend."
_THOR
"I'm not Banner's friend. I prefer you."
_HULK
"Banner's friend."
_THOR
"I don't even like Banner."
(bad impersonation)
 "I'm into numbers and science and
"stuff.""
_HULK
"Thor go. Hulk Stay."
_THOR
"Fine. Stay here. Stupid place. It's hideous, by the way. The red, the white. Just pick a color."
Thor heads for the exit, a wide open door.
_HULK
"Smash you."
_THOR
"You didn't smash anything. I won that fight"
_HULK
"I smashed you."
_THOR
"Yeah, sure, sure."
_HULK
"Baby Arms."
_THOR
"What?"
_HULK
"Baby."
_THOR
"Moron! You big child."
Thor heads to the open entrance. Hulk smiles, anticipating.
_HULK
"Thor go!"
_THOR
"I am going."
ZAP! Thor's jolted back by the obedience disk. There ar erimeter sensors in the doorway ulk CHUCKLES at Thor as he hits the floor. Points.
_HULK
"Thor go again!"
(then:)
"Thor home."
TIME CUT hor slumps against the wall, head sagging ulk grabs his giant battleaxe. He's armored up.
_HULK (CONT'D)
"Hulk trains."
_THOR
"That's great. Have fun."
Hulk exits. Thor watches him go. Then, at the end of th allway Hulk meets up with Valkyrie! They begin play ighting, a clearly friendly rapport hor can't believe it. He runs to the entrance, but by th ime he reaches the perimeter sensors they are gone hor sighs. Walks over to the window. Looks up through  ormhole, stars twinkling on the other end of it.
_THOR (CONT'D)
"Heimdall, I know you can see me."
Thor continues his plea at the window.
_THOR (CONT'D)
"I need you to help me. Help me see."
Pause. Then Thor's eyes go golden like Heimdall's! Th tars in the wormhole begin to WARP OVER THOR AND NT. STREETS OF ASGARD - SAME AA5 hor suddenly finds himself in Asgard. Disoriented at first hor turns to see Heimdall hiding in the shadows eimdall harshly SHUSHES Thor and gestures for him to get u gainst the wall. Thor complies. Sees the refugees fter a beat a roving patrol of Hela's Butchers creep b hrough the street. They don't spot our heroes. Pause eimdall turns to Thor, speaks only in hushed whispers.
_HEIMDALL
"I see you. But you are far away."
_THOR
"What's going on here?"
_HEIMDALL
"Come see for yourself."
Without warning, Heimdall leads the family out of the alle nd DASHES down the street. Thor follows.. ..but then stops. Looks around to see THE OCCUPIED CITY O SGARD, emitting a smoky aura of chaos. A chilling sight own the street, Heimdall gestures for the family to slo own. He sees something. Ushers them into an alcove hor joins them just in time to avoid being seen by anothe oving patrol of Hela's Butchers. Heimdall again motions fo hor to "shh" until the threat has passed. Then:
_HEIMDALL (CONT'D)
"I'm providing refuge in a stronghold build by our ancestors. But if the garrison falls our only escape will is Bi-Frost."
_THOR
"You're talking about evacuating Asgard?"
_HEIMDALL
"We won't last long if we stay."
Thor LOOKS OUT on a ravaged Asgard, heartsick old on the devastated Realm as:
_HEIMDALL (O.S.) (CONT'D)
"She draws her power from Asgard and grows stronger everyday."
Back to Thor and Heimdall.
_HEIMDALL (CONT'D)
"Come on."
As Heimdall quickly leads refugees down a safe pathway:
_HEIMDALL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
"Hela is ravenous. If I let her leave, she'll consume the Nine Realms and all the cosmos."
Turns back to Thor, approaches him.
_HEIMDALL (CONT'D)
"We need you."
_THOR
"I'm working on it, but I don't even really know where the hell I am."
Two packs of Butchers arrive simultaneously. Spot Heimdall.
_HEIMDALL
"You're on a planet surrounded by doorways. Go through one."
_THOR
"Which one?"
Heimdall RIPS into the attacking Butchers, CUTTING them down.
_HEIMDALL
"The big one!"
WHOOSH! SUDDENLY THOR'S GONE! BLACK fter slashing through the Butchers, Heimdall moves toward he house where he hid the family... and then abruptly stops eimdall turns slightly. He sees something INOCULARS POV: Heimdall looking right at us, the Bi-Fros word visible in his hand eveal Skurge on a palace tower balcony, surveilling the cit ith Asgardian E-noculars. Skurge lowers the E-noculars here is conflict on his face. He knows that he should repor his to Hela immediately...yet he doesn't spring into action.

57 INT. HULK'S WARRIOR SUITE - NIGHT

Thor absentmindedly fidgets with his Obedience Disk HUD! THUD! THUD! ...resonates around the room. Hulk step p to Thor, looking inquisitively down at him.
_HULK
"Thor sad."
_THOR
"Shut up."
Hulk HITS Thor, bullying him into opening up.
_HULK
"THOR SAD!!!"
Thor hops up, YELLS in Hulk's face. Paces around.
_THOR
"I'm not sad, you idiot. I'm pissed off! Angry. I lost my father. I lost my hammer."
THUD! THUD! He turns to see Hulk punching his pillow ulk stops. Stares.
_HULK
"Whining and crying. Cry like baby."
_THOR
"You're not even listening."
Thor KICKS a random helmet.
_HULK
"Don't kick stuff."
_THOR
"You're being a really bad friend."
_HULK
"You bad friend!"
_THOR
"You know what we call you?"
_HULK
"No."
_THOR
"We call you the stupid Avenger."
_HULK
"You're tiny Avenger!"
Hulk throws a shield that nearly decapitates Thor.
_THOR
"What, are you crazy?"
_HULK
"Yes."
_THOR
"You know what? Earth does hate you."
Hulk gets sad. Wanders over to his bed to mope hor realizes he went to far. Joins Hulk on the bed.
_HULK
"No."
_THOR
"I'm sorry I said those things. You're not the stupid Avenger. Nobody calls you the stupid Avenger."
_HULK
"It's okay."
_THOR
"You just can't go around throwing shields at people. Could have killed me."
_HULK
"I know. I'm sorry. I just get so angry all the time. Hulk always, always angry."
_THOR
"I know. We're the same, you and I. We're just a couple of hot-headed fools."
_HULK
"Yeah, same. Hulk like fire, Thor like water."
_THOR
"We're kind of both like fire."
_HULK
"But Hulk like real fire. Hulk like raging fire. Thor like smoldering fire."
_THOR
"Hulk, I need you to do something for me."
TIME CUT: Morning A-BOOM! BA-BOOM! BA-BOOM e follow Two Palace Guards as they enter Hulk's Suite ulk is throwing a LARGE BALL against the far wall. It's s ard it makes dents in the wall. Hulk stops and turns eveal that the guards are escorting Valkyrie. They leave.. alkyrie and Hulk face off.
_HULK
"Angry girl!"
Val bounds forward and gives The Incredible Hulk a big hug ulk laughs and then begins playfully roughhousing with Val.
_VALKYRIE
"What's going on? What do you...?"
Hulk steps away, allowing Valkyrie to see Thor. Her smil isappears. She stares at Hulk, so annoyed. Hulk mopes  ittle. Like, "I done bad." Turns back to Thor:
_VALKYRIE (CONT'D)
"You're so thick-headed that you can't tell when someone's hiding all the way across the universe and wants to be left alone?"
_THOR
"We need to talk."
_VALKYRIE
"No, you want to talk to me."
Valkyrie turns to leave.
_THOR
(to Hulk:)
"I need her to stay."
Valkyrie is at the exit when the UPPER JAWBONE of Hulk' assive skull bed CRASHES into frame, BLOCKING the doorway al shoots an annoyed sneer at Hulk. Hulk SNORTS back.
_HULK
"Stay! Please?"
Valkyrie looks him up and down. Obedience Disks to the max ulk begins BOUNCING his ball against the wall again alkyrie walks over to Hulk's bar, picks up an UNOPENE OTTLE of liquor. Hulk snorts, disapprovingly. Val puts i own and finds something cheaper, she pops the cork.
_VALKYRIE
"All right. Here's the deal. I'll listen to you till this is empty."
She TIPS BACK the bottle and starts CHUGGING.
_THOR
"Asgard is in danger and people are dying. We need to get back there. I need your help...wow."
_VALKYRIE
"Finished. Bye."
She has indeed finished. She goes to leave.
_THOR
"Odin is dead."
Valkyrie stops short (the BALL BANGING noise continues). He ilence speaks volumes. Thor has a realization.
_THOR (CONT'D)
"Hela, the Goddess of Death has invaded Asgard."
_VALKYRIE
"If Hela's back then Asgard is already lost."
_THOR
"I'm going to stop her."
_VALKYRIE
"Alone?"
_THOR
"Nope. I'm putting together a team. It's me, you, and the big guy."
_HULK
"No team. Only Hulk."
_THOR
"It's me and you."
_VALKYRIE
"I think it's only you."
_THOR
"Wait. Just listen. The Valkyrie are legend, elite warriors of Asgard. You are sworn to defend the throne."
_VALKYRIE
"I'm not getting dragged into another one of Odin's family squabbles."
_THOR
"What's that supposed to mean?"
_VALKYRIE
"Your sister. Her power comes from Asgard, same as yours."
Hulk's ball rolls into frame. An off screen GRUNT. Va icks it up and tosses it back to Hulk.
_VALKYRIE (CONT'D)
"When it grew beyond Odin's control, she massacred everyone in the palace and tried to seize the throne. When she tried to escape her banishment, he sent the Valkyrie in to fight her back. I only survived because..."
(trails off, brooding)
"Look, I already faced her once back when I believed in the throne, and it cost me everything. THAT'S what's wrong with Asgard. The throne, the secrets, the whole golden sham."
Pause. Thor moves towards Valkyrie, goes to put a comfortin and on her shoulder.
_THOR
"I agree."
Val SNATCHES his hand. They are close, face to face.
_VALKYRIE
"Don't get familiar."
_THOR
"I agree. That's why I turned down the throne. But this isn't about the crown. This is about the people. They're dying and they're you're people, too."
Val SHOVES him away. Thor stumbles back.
_VALKYRIE
"Forget it. I have."
_THOR
(nods, understanding)
"Okay."
_VALKYRIE
"Okay."
_THOR
"Good. Great."
_VALKYRIE
"Great."
_THOR
"Thank you."
_VALKYRIE
"For what?"
_THOR
"For this."
Reveal that Thor has lifted the fob device off Val's belt!
_THOR (CONT'D)
"Didn't see that did you?"
Thor presses the button and ALL THE OBEDIENCE DISKS EMBEDDE N HIS NECK AND BELT POWER DOWN! Confident smirk.
_THOR (CONT'D)
"There... that's better. You know, go ahead. Stay here and get drunk and enslave people for that lunatic. Keep drinking. Keep hiding."
(beat)
"But me..."
Thor gestures for Hulk to toss him the ball. Hulk does.
_THOR (CONT'D)
"I choose to run toward my problems and not away from them. Because that's what..."
Thor HURLS IT at the MAIN WINDOW - It bounces off, hittin hor in the face. He stands, facing Valkyrie.
_THOR (CONT'D)
"Because that's what heroes do."
Thor then SMASHES THROUGH THE WINDOW! Hulk STANDS...
_HULK
"Friend Stay!"

Thor enters and rushes to the controls.

_QUINJET (V.O.)
"Welcome, Point Break."
CAH-RUNCH! Hulk BARGES IN through the Quinjet door he Hulk approaches, scowling. Any metal that stands in hi ay PEELS BACK. Frantic, Thor turns to the Quinjet's console.
_HULK
"Friend stay!"
_THOR
"No, no, no!"
As Hulk enters, he DESTROYS the hull of the Quinjet.
_HULK
"Stay!"
_THOR
"Stop! Stop breaking everything!"
_HULK
"Don't go!"
Thor triggers a message on the flight console.
_NATASHA (V.O.)
"Nice work, big guy. We don't know where Ultron's headed, but you're going very high, very fast."
Hulk stops short. His whole demeanor changes hor steps out of the way so that Hulk can see a recorde essage from NATASHA ROMANOFF on the console.
_NATASHA (V.O.)
 ...So, I need you to turn this bird
"around, okay? We can't track you in stealth mode..."
Hulk is now right up against the console screen.
_NATASHA (V.O.)
 ...So I need you to help me out.
"Okay? I need you to..."
_HULK
"No! No, Banner!"
Hulk CONVULSES. Drops to his hands and knees. His whol ody warping. Hulk ROARS and GRABS at his face, SHAKING hi ead, trying to fight this back. But he can't help it.. ..HE'S TRANSFORMING BACK INTO BRUCE BANNER! The transitio s rough and chaotic, it's as if Banner is fighting to ge ut of the Hulk. Throughout the process, Hulk SMASHES bac nd forth, further WRECKING the Quinjet nd then, calm hor rushes to Banner's side to help ease the transition.
_THOR
"Banner. Hey, hey, hey. You all right, Banner? Sun's going down. Sun's going down. That's it, breathe. I won't hurt you. Sun's going down."
_BANNER
 ...Thor?
_THOR
"Yeah."
Banner is groggy, disoriented. Thoughts, memories, an bservations begin to flood his brain randomly.
_BANNER
"What happened to your hair?"
_THOR
"Some creepy old man cut it off."
_BANNER
"It looks good."
_THOR
"Thanks."
_BANNER
"Where are we? How's Nat?"
_THOR
"Nat is good, I'm sure."
_BANNER
"And what about Sokovia?"
_THOR
"Sokovia?"
_BANNER
"The city, Sokovia. Did we save it?"
_THOR
"Banner, listen."
_BANNER
"What?"
_THOR
"Sokovia. Ultron. That was two years ago."
_BANNER
"What are you saying? I've been Hulk for two years?"
_THOR
"I'm afraid so."
Banner's eyes BULGE. Trying to process this information.
_BANNER
"What the hell happened?"
Banner rushes to his feet. Thor follows.
_THOR
"Banner, there's something you should know..."
Banner goes to the flight console.
_QUINJET (V.O.)
"Voice Activation required."
_BANNER
"Banner."
_QUINJET (V.O.)
"Welccome, Strongest Avenger."
_THOR
(puzzled)
"What?"
_BANNER
"Ship's log..."
THE SHIP'S LOG POPS UP ON SCREEN ROM BEHIND THE DISPLAY (within the monitor looking out) w ee fragmented images of the Hulk's trip through deep space e see the angry green giant thrash around in zero gravity e see Hulk closer to the camera now, looking stressed an ar sick HROW FOCUS to see Banner's face watching the video, Hulk' reaked out face is super-imposed over Banner's freaked ou ace.
_BANNER (CONT'D)
"Thor, where are we?"
_THOR
"Yeah, about that."
Banner hears:
_GRANDMASTER (O.S.)
"It's bad news, bad news today."
Banner rushes over to the windshield. Through it he sees Grandmaster, his hologram projection towering over the city.
_GRANDMASTER (CONT'D)
"Sakaar, hear ye. Attention please. I have some bad news. My beloved, exalted Champion has turned up missing. Take to the streets. Celebrate my champion."
_BANNER
"Who's that?"
_THOR
"He kind of runs the place. You actually lived in his house."
Back to Banner. A distant, confused stare.
_BANNER
"I did?"
_THOR
"Yeah. Quite a lot's happened. You and I had a fight recently."
_BANNER
"Did I win?"
_THOR
"No, I won. Easily."
_BANNER
"Doesn't sound right."
_THOR
"Well, it's true."
_GRANDMASTER
"It seems that that criminally seductive Lord of Thunder has stolen him away."
_THOR
"Seductive GOD of Thunder. We need to move."
_BANNER
"Oh, no. This is bad. This is really, really bad. Thor, I think I'm freaking out."
_THOR
"No, no, no. Don't freak out. You're okay. Put these on."
Thor tosses Banner some clothes. Banner looks at them.
_BANNER
"These are Tony's clothes."
_THOR
"I know, come on."
_BANNER
"Is he here?"
_THOR
"No, he's not here. But listen. Just stay calm, okay? The sun's going down. The sun's getting really low. Sun's going down."

67 INT. GRANDMASTER'S CHAMBERS - DAY

Loki and Valkyrie are brought before Grandmaster, who has a east tripled the amount of bodyguards around him.
_GRANDMASTER
"I'm upset! I'm very upset. You know what I like about being upset? Blame. Right now, that's the mindset that I'm in. And you know who I'm blaming?"
_LOKI
"Grandmaster, I-"
_GRANDMASTER
"Hey! Don't interrupt me!"
Topaz hands the melt stick to the grandmaster.
_TOPAZ
"Here you go."
_GRANDMASTER
"Why are you handing me the melt stick? He was interrupting. That's not a capital violation."
(refocuses)
"My precious champion has come up missing and its all because of that Lord of Thunder. It's all because of him."
(to Loki)
"YOUR brother. Whatever the story is. Adopted, or complicated. I'm sure there's a big history."
(to Valkyrie)
"And YOUR contender."
_LOKI
"My dear friend, if you were to give me twelve hours I could bring them both back to you."
_VALKYRIE
"I can do it in two."
_LOKI
"I could do it in one."
_GRANDMASTER
"You know what? I woke up this morning thinking about a public execution. But for now, I'll settle for this sweet little "who's gonna get him first?" So you're on the clock."

64 INT. GRANDMASTER'S PALACE - DAY

Valkyrie exits in a hurry. Loki follows her.
_LOKI
"What have you done!?"
Val reverses position, putting Loki up against the wall.
_VALKYRIE
"I don't answer to you, lackey."
_LOKI
"It's Loki. And you will answer to the Grandmaster."
Loki moves to reverse position again, but Val BREAKS AWAY rawing her TWO BLADES. In response, Loki UNSHEATHES tw ong Sakaarian daggers. They eye each other, and then FIGHT! A fast-paced and deadly battle of knives. After  ew exchanges, Val connects a BIG SHOT that SLAMS Loki int he wall. He scowls.
_LOKI (CONT'D)
"Why would you help my brother escape with that green fool?"
_VALKYRIE
"I don't help anyone."
Loki trails off. He sees her wrist markings. A realization.
_LOKI
"You're a Valkyrie. I thought the Valkyrie all died gruesome deaths?"
Now Val ATTACKS Loki! She gets him up against the wall, he lade against his throat. She looks ready to kill him.
_VALKYRIE
"Choose your next words wisely."
_LOKI
"Terribly sorry. Must be a very painful memory..."
Quick as a rattlesnake, Loki GRABS Val's head and CASTS a llusion. Val's eyes CLOUD OVER with darkness as we go to:

65 EXT. HELA'S DIMENSION - FLASHBACK

A barren black void of death he VALKYRIE, in old school Asgardian armor, charge throug he DIMENSIONAL RIFT, an open portal to Asgard and the Nin ealms. Val witnesses these events as moments frozen in time  Reveal Hela in all her glory, black lightning everywhere  Dozens of Valkyrie falling through the dark space  The Valkyrie's winged horses lay dead on the battlefield  Through the open portal we can see the throne of Asgard  Hela advancing on the final few Valkyrie - one is Val rozen in fear, shell-shocked  Hela FIRING black weapons at Val..  One of Val's sisters DIVING IN at the last second, SHOVIN AL back through the PORTAL and taking the fatal hit  Val lands hard in the Throne room  Val scrambling to her feet and trying to re-enter the rif ut it's too late. It closes, the last image she sees is Hel ealing the final killer blow to her doomed Valkyrie sisters.

66 EXT. GRANDMASTER'S PALACE - CONTINUOUS

We find Val on her knees in front of Loki, trembling fro his visceral memory that she's tried so hard to suppress he turns on Loki, raging, and knocks him out.

69 EXT. SAKAAR - STOOP - DAY

BANNER sits, groaning, head in his hands. THOR is besid im, rubbing his back and on the lookout for threats.
_THOR
"The sun's going down. It's getting really low. The sun's going down. It's getting real low."
_BANNER
"Would you stop saying that!?"
_THOR
"I just need you to stay calm."
_BANNER
"Calm!? I'm on an alien planet!"
_THOR
"It's just a planet. You've been on a planet before."
_BANNER
"Yeah! One!"
_THOR
"Now you've been on two. That's a good thing. It's a new experience."
_BANNER
"My neurons, they're firing faster than my brain can handle the information."
(MORE)
"BANNER (CONT'D)"
The whole thing is totall ifferent this time beat n the past, I always felt lik ulk and I each had a hand on th heel, but this time it's like h ad the keys and I was locked i he trunk.
"THOR"
Alright, well, you're back now hat's all that matters.
"BANNER"
No, it's not what matters. Wha 'm trying to tell you, is that i  turn into the Hulk again, Banne ay never come back. And we'r tranded on a planet that i esigned to stress me out.
"THOR"
We're not stranded, I'm gonn igure out a way to get us home.
"BANNER"
Thank you.
"THOR"
Not your home, though. Asgard.
"BANNER"
What?
"THOR"
Listen, my people are in grea anger. You and I, we have t ight this really powerful bein ho also happens to be my sister.
"BANNER"
Okay, that is so wrong on s any... I don't wanna fight you ister. That's a family issue.
"THOR"
No, she's an evil being.
"BANNER"
I don't care what she is. I'm no ighting any more beings. I'm sic f it. I just told you.
 (MORE)
_BANNER (CONT'D)
"If I turn into the Hulk, I am never gonna come back again. And you don't care."
_THOR
"No, no. I'm putting together the team. The Hulk is the fire."
_BANNER
"Wait, you're just using me to get to the Hulk."
_THOR
"What? No!"
_BANNER
"It's gross. You don't care about me. You're not my friend."
_THOR
"No! I don't even like the Hulk. He's all like... "smash, smash, smash." I prefer you."
_BANNER
"Thanks."
_THOR
"But if I'm being honest, when it comes to fighting evil beings, he is very powerful and useful."
_BANNER
"Yeah, Banner's powerful and useful, too."
_THOR
"Is he though?"
_BANNER
"How many PhDs does Hulk have? Zero. How many PhDs does Banner have? Seven."
_THOR
"Fine, you don't have to fight anyone. But we're in danger here, so we have to move."
Thor grabs a towel from the ground next to him. He puts th owel over his head.
_BANNER
"What are you doing with that?"
_THOR
"I need a disguise. I'm a fugitive."
_BANNER
"I need a disguise."
_THOR
"You are the disguise."
Banner finds a pair of Stark's sunglasses in his jacket.
_BANNER
"I'll be Tony Stark."
_THOR
"What?"
_BANNER
"Yeah. Tony and the gypsy."
_THOR
"No, no you're not Tony. You're Bruce Banner."
_BANNER
"Then why did you dress me up like Tony?"
_THOR
"Because you were naked."
_BANNER
"Okay, I'll give you that."
They stand up. Banner adjusts his crotch.
_THOR
"What are you doing? Stop doing that!"
_BANNER
"Tony wears his pants super tight!"
_THOR
"Why are you being so weird?"
_BANNER
"I don't know. Maybe the fact that I was trapped for two years inside of a monster made me a little weird."
Banner flashes green. Thor calms him down.
_THOR
"Hey. It's okay. You're good. Calm down. Come on. Listen, we're gonna go to Asgard and you're not gonna have to think about the Hulk ever again. All right?"
_BANNER
"All right."
WHAP! Banner gets nailed in the face with green paint aught off guard, Thor and Banner are swept off into-

69A EXT. PARADE OF VICTORS - CONTINUOUS 69A

It's a massive street festival where revelers dance and chee hile throwing powdered paint at each other... in celebratio f Hulk! Green EVERYWHERE nside the parade it is total chaos. Thor searches for Banne s he's PELTED with green powder. Pandemonium. In the crow hor sees a pack of SCRAPPERS on the hunt for the reward hor spots Banner. He surges forward, GRABS Banner, an ulls him into another alley, but sees Valkyrie is approaching from down the alley!
_THOR
"This is bad. Banner! Banner!"
Thor pulls Banner back into the crowd. Thor briefly turns t ee that he is no longer holding Banner's - it's the arm of  MALL ALIEN who squeals in fright hor sees Banner across the crowd hor MUSCLES his way through the madness, knocking rowdy fan side. He reaches Banner and holds him protectively wkwardly trying to rub his shoulders ne of the aliens Thor knocked aside turns out to be  ASSIVE SCRAPPER. He rears up, turning on Thor and Banner HAM! From out of nowhere, Valkyrie CLOCKS this Scrappe ith a brass knuckle right cross. The Scrapper DROPS hor looks at Val while clutching Banner like a child.
_THOR (CONT'D)
"Hi."
_VALKYRIE
"Hi."
_THOR
"I was gonna do that."
_VALKYRIE
"Yeah, well, I did it first."
_THOR
"That's good. What are you doing here?"
_VALKYRIE
"What are you doing here? I thought you were leaving."
_THOR
"I got sidetracked."
_VALKYRIE
"What's with the..."
_THOR
"It's my disguise."
_VALKYRIE
"But I can see your face."
_THOR
(covers his face)
"Not when I do this, you can't."
(then:)
"Your hair looks nice. I like what you did with it. Change it? Washed it maybe?"
Valkyrie just rolls her eyes, takes Thor by the arm.
_BANNER
(to Thor:)
"What are those things on her eyes? Are those the people that she's killed? She's so beautiful and strong..."

69B EXT. SAKAARIAN STREET - MOMENTS LATER 69B

Valkyrie escorts Thor and Banner through the street.
_VALKYRIE
"Who is this guy?"
_THOR
"He's a friend."
_BANNER
"Who? Me? I'm Bruce."
As Val leads them into Sakaarian apartment building.
_VALKYRIE
"I feel like I know you."
_BANNER
"I feel like I know you too."
INT. SAKAARIAN BUILDING - HALLWAY - CONTINUOU ontinue down the hallway.
_VALKYRIE
"Look, I've spent years in a haze trying to forget my past. Sakaaar seemed like the best place to drink and forget and to die one day."
_THOR
"I was thinking that you drink too much, and that probably was going to kill you."
_VALKYRIE
"I don't plan to stop drinking, but I don't want to forget. I can't turn away anymore. So, if I'm donna to die, well... it may as well be driving my sword through the heart of that murderous hag."
_THOR
"Good."
They arrive at a door. Before they enter:
_VALKYRIE
"Yeah. So I'm saying that I wanna be on the team. Has it got a name?"
_THOR
"Yeah, it's called the Revengers."
_VALKYRIE
"Revengers?"
_THOR
"Because I'm getting revenge. You're getting revenge."
(to Banner:)
"Do you want revenge?"
_BANNER
"I'm undecided."
_THOR
"Okay."
_VALKYRIE
"Also, I've got a peace offering."

73 INT. VALKYRIE'S APARTMENT - DAY

Valkyrie opens the front door, revealing Loki! He is as restrained as anyone could be, sitting i he middle of the apartment with a dozen chains around him.
_LOKIE
"Surprise."
Thor TOSSES a bottle. It BOUNCES off of Loki's head.
_LOKI
"OW!"
_THOR
"Just had to be sure."
_LOKI
"Hello, Bruce."
_BANNER
"So, last time I saw you, you were trying to kill everybody. Where are you at these days?"
_LOKI
"It varies from moment to moment."
Val's apartment is a shithole. Bottles everywhere, blood pattered clothes in the corner, a knife in the wall, etc anner gives Thor a look like "she might be crazy." Tho esponds with a "No, she's cool" gesture al lays something on the bed. Unwraps it to reveal AN OL SGARDIAN SWORD. Thor's eyes go wide as she sharpens it.
_THOR
"Is that... a Dragonfang?"
_VALKYRIE
"It is."
_THOR
"My God. This is the famed sword of the Valkyrie."
_VALKYRIE
"Sakaar and Asgard are about as far apart as any two known systems. Our best bet is a wormhole just outside the city limits."
A nice clean wormhole outside the city.
_VALKYRIE (CONT'D)
"Refuel on Xandar and be back in Asgard in around"
months.
_THOR
"Nope. We're going through that one."
Thor points at the nightmare tornado wormhole over the ocean.
_VALKYRIE
"The Devil's Anus?"
_BANNER
"Wait, whose anus are we going through?"
_THOR
"For the record, I didn't know it was called that when I picked it."
_BANNER
"That looks like a collapsing neutron star inside of an Einstein- Rosen Bridge."
_VALKYRIE
"We need another ship. That would tear mine to pieces."
_THOR
"She's right. We need one that can withstand the geodetic strain from the singularity."
Banner gives Thor a quizzical look.
_BANNER
"And has an offline power steering system that could also function without the on-board computer."
_VALKYRIE
"And we need one with cup holders, because we're gonna die. So, drinks!"
_BANNER
"Do I know you? I feel like I know you."
_VALKYRIE
"I feel like I know you, too. It's weird."
_THOR
(to Banner:)
"What do you say, doctor? Uncharted metagalactic travel through a volatile cosmic gateway. Talk about an adventure."
Thor and Banner high five as Val stares at them blankly.
"BANNER THOR (CONT'D)"
We need a ship. Need a ship.
_VALKYRIE
"There are one or two ships, absolute top-of-the-line models--"
_LOKI
"I don't mean to impose, but the Grandmaster has a great many ships. I may eve have stolen the access codes to his security system."
All eyes turn to Loki. Valkyrie throws her bottle at him. I mashes above his head.
_VALKYRIE
"And suddenly you're overcome with an urge to do the right thing."
_LOKI
"Heavens, no. I've run out of favor with the Grandmaster."
(MORE)
_LOKI (CONT'D)
"And in exchange for codes and access to a ship I'm asking for safe passage...through the anus."
_THOR
"You're telling us you can get us access into the garage without setting off any alarms?"
_LOKI
"Yes, brother. I can."
_BANNER
"Okay, can I just... A quick FYI, I was just talking to him just a couple minutes ago and he was totally ready to kill any of us."
_VALKYRIE
"He did try to kill me."
_THOR
"Yes, me too. On many, many occasions. There was one time when we were children, he transformed himself into a snake, and he knows that I love snakes. So, I went to pick up the snake to admire it and he transformed back into himself and he was like, "Yeah, it's me!" And he stabbed me. We were eight at the time."
Loki suppresses a smile.
_VALKYRIE
"If we're boosting a ship, we're gonna need to draw some guards away from the palace."
_LOKI
"Why not set the beast loose?"
_THOR
"Shut up."
_VALKYRIE
"You guys have a beast?"
_THOR
"No, there's no beast. He's just being stupid. We're going to start a revolution."
_BANNER
"Revolution?"
_THOR
"I'll explain later."
_VALKYRIE
"Who's this guy again?"
_THOR
"I'll explain later."

75 INT. THE ARENA - GLADIATOR CELLS - MOMENTS LATER

Korg sits with his cell mates. He's talking to Miek.
_KORG
"Is that some sort of protoplasm, all the stuff that's coming out of you? Or are they eggs? Looks like eggs."
Suddenly his Obedience Disk POWERS DOWN. No longer glowing s Korg stands up, Valkyrie appears at the door to his cell.
_VALKYRIE
"I'm looking for Korg."
_KORG
"Who's asking? I know you're asking. Is anyone else asking, or is it just you?"
Valkyrie tosses him a high-tech rifle.
_VALKYRIE
"The Lord of Thunder sends his best."
_KORG
"My revolution has begun..."

76 INT. GRANDMASTER'S CHAMBERS - DAY

Grandmaster speaks with Topaz who now wears battle armor.
_GRANDMASTER
"Revolution? How did this happen?"
_TOPAZ
"Don't know. But the Arena's mainframe for the Obedience Disks have been deactivated and the slaves have armed themselves."
_GRANDMASTER
"Oh! I don't like that word!"
_TOPAZ
"Mainframe?"
_GRANDMASTER
"No. Why would I not like"
 "mainframe?" No, the "S" word.
_TOPAZ
"Sorry, the "prisoners with jobs" have armed themselves."
_GRANDMASTER
"Okay, that's better."
CHA-CHNK! SOUNDS OF MACHINERY as the whole space start oving. A different angle reveals that we are in XT. THE STATESMAN - CONTINUOU randmaster's chambers are actually the oversized cockpit o  A HUGE RIOT CONTROL SHIP (The Statesman) that can doc tself indefinitely within the palace he Statesman has DISLODGED from the palace and is no lanked by six smaller Sakaarian peace-keeping ships, al eaded towards the city where RIOTING can be heard.

77 INT. GRANDMASTER'S PALACE - GROUND LEVEL - CONTINUOUS

Thor waits as Loki enters codes to a door's security panel.
_THOR
"Hey, so listen, we should talk."
_LOKI
"I disagree. Open communication was never our family's forte."
_THOR
"You have no idea. I've had quite the revelation since we spoke last."
The door opens, revealing a bunch of guards hor and Loki heft up two Sakaarian guns.
_THOR (CONT'D)
"Hello!"
_LOKI
"Hi!"
Thor and Loki BLAST all the guards, moving to another door.
_LOKI (CONT'D)
"Odin brought us together, it's almost poetic that his death should split us apart. We might as well be strangers now. "Two sons of the crown" set adrift."
A guard tries to ambush Loki through the door. Thor TAKE UT the guard.
_THOR
"Thought you didn't want to talk about it?"

79 INT. GRANDMASTER'S PALACE - ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS

Thor and Loki are going up.
_LOKI
"Here's the thing. I'm probably better off staying here on Sakaar."
_THOR
"That's exactly what I was thinking."
_LOKI
 ...Did you just agree with me?
_THOR
"This place is perfect for you. It's savage, chaotic, lawless. Brother, you're going to do GREAT here."
_LOKI
"Do you truly think so little of me?"
Thor pauses, considers his brother. Then:
_THOR
"Loki, I thought the world of you. I thought we were gonna fight side by side forever. But, at the end of the day, you're you, I'm me..."
(MORE)
_THOR (CONT'D)
"I don't know, maybe there's still good in you, but let's be honest, our paths diverged a long time ago."
Loki is wounded by Thor's willingness to discard him. Mask is feelings with:
_LOKI
"It's probably for the best that we never see one another again."
Beat. Thor pats Loki affectionately on the shoulder old on Loki. Did Thor just get through to him?
_THOR
"That's what you always wanted."
Beat. Then:
_THOR (CONT'D)
"Hey, let's do "Get Help.""
_LOKI
"What?"
_THOR
 "Get Help."
_LOKI
"No."
_THOR
"Come on, you love it."
_LOKI
"I hate it."
_THOR
"It's great. IT works every time."
_LOKI
"It's humiliating."
_THOR
"Do you have a better plan?"
_LOKI
"No."
_THOR
"We're doing it."
_LOKI
"We are not doing "Get Help.""

82 INT. GRANDMASTER'S PRIVATE GARAGE - CONTINUOUS

Multi-tiered platforms with dozens of cool spaceships he elevator doors open. Thor supports Loki's weight wit oki faking a fatal injury.
_THOR
"Get help! Please! My brother, he's dying."
A small group of Sakaarian guards turn toward Thor and Loki ne guard aims his gun at them.
_THOR (CONT'D)
"Get help! Help him!"
Thor picked up Loki and flings him at the guards, knockin hem down like bowling pins. Loki stands up and Thor step o Loki's side.
_THOR (CONT'D)
"Classic."
_LOKI
"I still hate it. It's humiliating."
_THOR
"Not for me, it's not."
_THOR (CONT'D)
"Which one's the ship she told us to get?"
_LOKI
(points)
"The Commodore."
The COMMODORE starship. Brand new, solidly built, sleek s they walk towards it a DUPLICATE LOKI FORMS and LAG EHIND. The Loki walking with Thor is an illusion.
_LOKI (CONT'D)
"Though I feel it won't make much of a difference..."
We follow the real Loki as he slinks away towards th ecurity system panel. He activates the panel and brings up  creen that will set off all the alarms palace-wide!
_THOR (O.S.)

Angle on Korg, who is holding Miek (sans robot exoskeleton).
_KORG
"Oh, Miek's dead. I accidentally stepped on him on the bridge, I've just felt so guilty I've been carrying him around all day..."
Miek WRIGGLES to life. Korg lights up.

Thor smiles, getting it. Pats Loki on the shoulder.
