"We home in on a snake crawling through the undergrowth. TITLES INT. DARK ROOM - NIGHT TIME An old man lights a gas oven with a match, he is preparing food.  He notices a light on in the large house opposite, he stops what  he's doing and walks to the door."

_OLD MAN
_Bloody kids.
"He leaves the house and heads towards the light."
 
"EXT. DARKNESS The old man is wandering up to the house carrying a lit torch.  He opens the front door, inside is just as dark. He begins climbing  the stairs, we hear whispers and hushed voices coming from upstairs.  The old man waits outside the room where the conversation is  taking place and listens on."

_WORMTAIL
_Oh no no no my Lord Voldemort. I only 
 meant... perhaps if we were to do it 
 without the boy..

_VOLDEMORT
_NO! The boy is everything, it cannot 
 be done without him and it WILL be done 
 exactly as I say.

_UNKNOWN MAN
_I will not disappoint you my lord.

 
_VOLDEMORT
_Good. First, gather our old comrades. 
_Send them a sign.

"A snake slithers past the old man and into the room. "
_VOLDEMORT
_Nagini tells me the old caretaker is 
 standing outside the door.

"Wormtail stands in the doorway and looks at the old man. The  old man looks terrified."

_VOLDEMORT
_Step aside so I can give our guest a 
 proper greeting.

"A loud spell is cast and Harry wakes up in a flash of panic."

 
 
"INT. BEDROOM"
_HERMIONE
_Harry!
"Harry is flustered and still panicing."
_HERMIONE
_Are you alright?
_HARRY
_Hermione. Bad dream. When did you get 
 here?

_HERMIONE
_Just now. You?
_HARRY
_Last night.
"Hermione goes over to Ron's bed."
_HERMIONE
_Wake up. Wake up Ronald!
_RON
_Bloody hell.
_HERMIONE
_Honestly. Get dressed, and don't go 
 back to sleep. Come on Ron! Your mother 
 says breakfast's ready.

 
"EXT. GRASSLAND"
_HARRY
_Where are we actually going?
_RON
_Don't know. Hey Dad! Where are we going?

 
_ARTHUR
_Haven't the foggiest, keep up!
_AMOS
_Arthur! It's about time son.
_ARTHUR
_Sorry Amos. Some of us had a bit of 
 a sleepy start. This is Amos Diggory 
 everyone, he works with me at the ministry. 
_And this strapping young lad must be 
_Cedric, am I right?

_CEDRIC
_Yes sir. 
_AMOS
_Merlin's beard, you must be Harry Potter.

 
_HARRY
_Yes sir. This way.
_AMOS
_Great great pleasure.
"They shake hands."
_HARRY
_Pleasure to meet you too sir.
"They walk on up the hill."
_ARTHUR
_That's it sir, just over there.
_AMOS
_Shall we? We don't want to be late.

 
"Camera homes in on a boot on top of the hillside."
_HARRY
_Why are they all standing around that 
 manky old boot?

_FRED
_That isn't just any old manky boot mate.

 
_GEORGE
_It's a portkey.
"Everyone is in a circle putting their hands on the boot."
_AMOS
_Time to go. Ready?
_HARRY
_What's a 'portkey'?
_AMOS
_After
One... Two...
_ARTHUR
_Harry!
"Harry rushes over and puts his hand on the boot."
_AMOS
_Three!
"There's a white flash and suddenly they're all flying through  the air. Everyone cheers. "

_ARTHUR
_Let go kids!
_HERMIONE
_What??
_ARTHUR
_Let! Go!
"Harry, Hermione and the young Weasleys crash to the ground with  a thump. Arthur, Amos and Cedric come down more gracefully."

 
_ARTHUR
_I bet that cleared your sinuses eh?

 
"Cedric helps Harry to his feet."
_HARRY
_Thanks.
"They walk across the field and we see there's a massive crowd  gathered and cheering, tents are set up all over."

_ARTHUR
_Well kids, welcome to the Quidditch 
_World Cup!

"They walk into the crowd, taking in the sights. Music is playing  and people fly about overhead on brooms. They approach a small  tent."

_AMOS
_Parting of the waves I think old chap, 
 see you at the match.

"Amos and Cedric separate and walk off."
_HARRY
_See ya later Cedric.
_ARTHUR
_Home sweet home.
 
"INT. TENT They enter the tent, the inside is many times bigger than the  outside."

_ARTHUR
_Girls. Choose a bunk and unpack. Ron, 
 get out of the kitchen we're all hungry.

 
_TWINS
_Yeah get out of the kitchen Ron.
_ARTHUR
_Feet off the table.
_TWINS
_Feet off the table.
"They take their feet off the table and put them back on as soon  as Arthur has walked past."

_HARRY
(Smiling) I love magic.
 
"EXT. HILLSIDE We pan up the hillside onto a large stadium which seems to have  a huge number of floors."

"INT. STADIUM The Weasleys and Harry are finding their seats."
_RON
_Blimey Dad, how far up ARE we?
"Lucius Malfoy and Draco are walking below them."
_LUCIUS
_Well put it this way, if it rains... 
 you'll be the first to know

_DRACO
_Father and I are in the minister's box, 
 by personal invitation of Cornelius 
_Fudge himself.

_LUCIUS
_Don't boast Draco. There's no need with 
 these people. Do enjoy yourself won't 
 you. While you can.

"The ceremonies begin. Balloons fly and fireworks go off."
_ARTHUR
_Come on up, take your seats. I told 
 you these seats would be worth waiting 
 for.

_GEORGE
_Come on!
_FRED
_It's the Irish!
"Five green and white figures fly through the air on their brooms  leaving a colored trail behind them. A glittering leprechaun  appears in the sky and starts dancing. Everyone is excited."

 
_GEORGE
_Here come the Bulgarians!
"Five red figures this time, one of them performs a stunt on his  broom. One of them appears on the large screen. The crowd begins  to chant 'Krum, Krum, Krum'. "

_WEASLEYS
_Krum!!!
_GEORGE
_Yes!
"Viktor Krum waves to the crowd."
_ANNOUNCER
_Good evening! It gives me great pleasure 
 to welcome each and every one of you 
 to the final of the 422nd Quidditch 
_World Cup. Let the match begin!

 
"INT. TENT"
_RON
_There's no one like Krum. He's like 
 a bird the way he rides the wind. He's 
 more than an athlete, he's an artist.

 
"The twins are bumbling about in a comical way muttering 'KRUMMMM'."

 
_GINNY
_Think you're in love Ron?
_TWINS
(Singing) Viktor I love you! Viktor 
_I do!

"Harry joins in."
_BOYS
_When we're apart my heart beats only 
 for youuu!

_FRED
_Sounds like the irish have got their 
 pride on.

_ARTHUR
_Stop! Stop it. It's not the irish. We've 
 gotta get out of here. Now.

 
"EXT. OUTSIDE THE TENT"
_ARTHUR
_Get back to the portkey everybody, and 
 stick together. Fred, George... Ginny 
 is your responsibility.

"Some figures in pointed hoods carrying flaming torches are walking  across the campsite chanting ominous noises. The crowd is paniced  and rushing all over. Harry is trampled unconscious."

 
"EXT. OUTSIDE - TIME PASSED The crowds have all gone. A man walks through the rubble kicking  at things. He casts a spell which causes a bright flash and a  large ghostly skull forms in the sky with a snake crawling from  it. The man grins evilly, clearly demented. Harry stirs and witnesses  the man standing there. Harry runs. The familiar voices of Ron  and Hermione are calling for him."

_RON
_Been looking for you for ages. Thought 
 we lost you.

_HARRY
_What is THAT?
"They look at the monstrous thing in the sky, Harry holds his  head in pain. Suddenly they are fired on. "

_ARTHUR
_Stop! That's my son.
"Arthur and others approach."
_ARTHUR
_Ron, Harry, Hermione are you alright?

 
_BARTY
_Which of you conjured this?
_ARTHUR
_You can't possibly..
_BARTY
_Do not lie! You have been discovered 
 at the scene of the crime!

_HARRY
_Crime?
_ARTHUR
_Barty, they're just kids.
_HARRY
_What crime?
_HERMIONE
_Harry it's his mark.
_HARRY
_Those people tonight, in the masks... 
 they're his too aren't they? they're 
 his followers. 

_BARTY
_Follow me.
_HARRY
_There was a man. Before. There.
_BARTY
_All of you, this way.
_ARTHUR
_Harry, who?
_HARRY
_I dunno. I didn't see his face.
 
"INT. TRAIN CARRIAGE Harry, Ron and Hermione are seated on a train. A voice calls  out."

_LADY OFFSCREEN
_Anything from the trolley? Anything 
 from the trolley?

"The lady appears at their door."
_LADY
_Anything from the trolley dears?
_RON
_Packet of drewbals and a liquorice wand.

 
"Ron sees he hasn't enough money."
_RON
_On second thought, just the drewbals.

 
_HARRY
_It's alright I'll get it.
_RON
_Just the drewbals, thanks.
"Cho Chan walks up to the trolley."
_CHO
_Two pumpkin pasties please.
"Harry and Cho look at each other and smile."
_CHO
_Thank you.
_LADY
_Anything sweet for you dear?
_HARRY
_Oh no thank you I'm not hungry.
_HERMIONE
_This is horrible, how can the ministry 
 not know who conjured it. Isn't there 
 any security or?

_RON
_Loads according to Dad, that's what 
 worried them so much. Happened right 
 under their noses.

"Hermione sees Harry rubbing his head."
_HERMIONE
_It's hurting again isn't it, your scar.

 
_HARRY
_I'm fine.
_HERMIONE
_You know Sirius will want to hear about 
 this. What you saw at the world cup, 
 and the dream.

"Harry has written a letter, he marks Sirius Black on an envelope  and gives it to an owl."

 
"EXT. HOGWARTS We see four flying horses flying through the air pulling a carriage  coming in to land at Hogwarts. The crowds cheer."

_HAGRID
_Clear the runway.
_HARRY
_Well there's something you don't see 
 every day.

"A large ship emerges from under the water and approaches too."

 
_DUMBLEDORE
_Now we're all settled in and sorted, 
_I'd like to make an announcement. This 
 castle will not only be your home this 
 year but home to some very special guests 
 as well. You see Hogwarts has been choosen...

 
"A man runs up the aisle limping in a comical way, he whispers  something to Dumbledore and leaves in the same fashion."

_DUMBLEDORE
_So Hogwarts has been choosen to host 
 a legendary event. The Tri-Wizard tournament. 
_Now for those of you who do not know, 
 the tri-wizard tournament brings together 
 three schools for a series of magical 
 contests. From each school a single 
 contestant is selected to compete. Now 
 let me be clear, if choosen you stand 
 alone. And trust me when I say these 
 contests are not for the faint hearted, 
 but more of that later. For now please 
 join me in welcoming the lovely ladies 
 of the Beauxbatons Academy of magic 
 and their headmistress Madam Maxime.

 
"A group of girls dressed in blue dance up the aisle and release  butterflies into the air. They bow and everyone applauds."

_STUDENT
_Blimey, that's one big woman.
_DUMBLEDORE
_And now our friends from the north, 
 please greet the proud sons of Durmstrang 
 and the high master Igor Karkaroff.

 
"A series of older boys walk up the aisle brandishing bo staffs,  twirling them around and periodically stabbing them into the  ground with a spark effect."

_RON
_Blimey it's him, Viktor Krum!
"The boys breathe some fire."
_IGOR
_Albus!
_DUMBLEDORE
_Igor.
"They embrace."
 
"EXT. HOGWARTS - STORMY - NIGHT"
_MADAME MAXIME
_Professor Dumbledore, my horses have 
 travelled a long way. They will need 
 attending to.

_DUMBLEDORE
_Not to worry Madame Maxime, our gamekeeper 
_Hagrid's more than capable of seeing 
 to them.

_MADAME MAXIME
_But you know Monsieur Hagrid, they drink 
 only single malt whiskey.

"The man seated next to Hagrid yelps. Hagrid has stabbed a fork  into his hand."

_MAN
_You idiot!
 
"INT. ASSEMBLY ROOM"
_DUMBLEDORE
_Your attention please! I would like 
 to say a few words. Eternal glory, that 
 is what awaits the student who wins 
 the tri-wizard tournament. But to do 
 this that student must survive three 
 tasks. Three extremely dangerous tasks.

 
_FRED
_Wicked.
_DUMBLEDORE
_For this reason the ministry has seen 
 fit to impose a new rule. To explain 
 all this we have the head of the department 
 of international magic cooperation Mister 
_Bartimus Crouch.

"Thunder roars overhead, rain begins leaking through the roof  and screams break out. A strange man stands in the doorway, he  casts some magic upwards and seals the roof. Peace is restored."

 
_RON
_Bloody hell, it's Mad-Eye Moody.
_HERMIONE
_Alastor Moody? The aura.
_RON
_He was a catcher. Half the cells in 
_Azkaban are full thanks to him. He's 
 supposed to be mad as a hatter though 
 these days.

"This character enters the room and begins walking. We see Harry  through his mechanical eye. He limps, breathing heavily as he  goes."

_DUMBLEDORE
_My dear old friend, thanks for coming.

 
_MAD-EYE
_That stupid roof.
"Mad-Eye takes a drink."
_PUPIL
_What's that he's drinking do you suppose?

 
_HARRY
_I don't know but I don't think it's 
_Pumpkin Juice.

_BARTY
_After much deliberation the ministry 
 has concluded that for their own safety 
 no student under the age of seventeen 
 shall be allowed to put forth their 
 name for the tri-wizard tournament. 
_This decision is final.

"The crowd is unsettled, people are booing."
_GEORGE
_That's rubbish! You don't know what 
 you're doing!

_DUMBLEDORE
_Silence! 
"Dumbledore casts magic over a box which melds into a goblet containing  a blue flame."

_DUMBLEDORE
_The goblet of fire. Anyone wishing to 
 submit themselves for the tournament 
 merely write their name upon a piece 
 of parchment and throw it in the flame 
 before this hour on Thursday night. 
_Do not do so lightly, if choosen there's 
 no turning back. As from this moment 
 the tri-wizard tournament has begun.

 
 
"INT. ASSEMBLY ROOM - NIGHT We see a suspicious character enter the room where the goblet  is still burning and close the door behind him."

 
"INT. CLASSROOM"
_MAD-EYE
_Alastor Moody.
"He writes his name on the board."
_MAD-EYE
_Ministry malcontent. And your new defence 
 against the dark arts teacher. I'm here 
 because Dumbledore asked me, end of 
 story, goodbye, the end. Any questions? 
_When it comes to the dark arts, I believe 
 in a practical approach. But first, 
 which of you can tell me how many unforgivable 
 curses there are?

_HERMIONE
_Three sir.
_MAD-EYE
_And they are so named?
_HERMIONE
_Because they are unforgivable. Use of 
 any one of them will...

_MAD-EYE
_Will earn you a one way ticket to Azkaban. 
_Correct. Now the ministry says you're 
 too young to see what these curses do. 
_I say different! You need to know what 
 you're up against, you need to be prepared, 
 you need to find somewhere else to put 
 your chewing gum other than the underside 
 of your desk Mr Finnigan!

_PUPIL
_Aw no way, the old codger can see out 
 the back of his head.

"Mad-Eye throws the chalk in anger."
_MAD-EYE
_So, which curse shall we see first? 
_WEASLEY!

_RON
_Yes...
_MAD-EYE
_Give us a curse.
_RON
_Well, my dad did tell me about one... 
_The imperious curse.

_MAD-EYE
_Ahhh yes, your father would know all 
 about that. Gave the ministry quite 
 a bit of grief a few years ago. Perhaps 
 this will show you why.

"Mad-Eye pops open a jar with a spider in it."
_MAD-EYE
_Hello. What a little beauty. 
"He uses his wand to send it around the class."
_MAD-EYE
_Don't worry. Completely harmless.
"The class is unsettled."
_MAD-EYE
_But if she bites... she's lethal!
"Draco laughs."
_MAD-EYE
_What are you laughing at?
"Mad-Eye sends the spider onto Draco's face."
_MAD-EYE
_Talented isn't she? What shall I have 
 her do next? Jump out the window? Drown 
 herself?

"Mad-Eye has the spider over a bucket of water, it's wriggling."

 
_MAD-EYE
_Scores of witches and wizards have claimed 
 that they only do did you-know-whose 
 bidding under the influence of the imperious 
 curse. But here's the rub, how do we 
 sort out the liars? Another.. another.. 
_Come on come on. Longbottom is it? Up.

 
"Neville Longbottom stands."
_MAD-EYE
_Professor Sprout tells me you have an 
 aptitude for herbology.

_NEVILLE
_There's the um... The cruciatus curse.

 
_MAD-EYE
_Correct! Correct! come come. Particularly 
 nasty. The torture curse.

"Mad-Eye begins torturing the spider with magic, it squeals."

 
_HERMIONE
_Stop it! Can't you see it's bothering 
 him, stop it!

"Mad-Eye stops. Neville is disturbed. Mad-Eye picks up the spider  which is still making a noise."

_MAD-EYE
_Perhaps you could give us the last unforgivable 
 curse Miss Granger.

"Hermione shakes her head. He casts a spell and the spider disintegrates."

 
_MAD-EYE
_The killing curse. Only one person is 
 known to have survived it. And he's 
 sitting in this room.

"He approaches Harry's desk and takes a drink."
 
"INT. STAIRS"
_RON
_Brilliant isn't he! Completely demented 
 of course. Terrifying to be in the same 
 room with, he's really BEEN there you 
 know.

_HERMIONE
_There's a reason those curses are unforgivable, 
 and to perform them in a classroom. 
_I mean did you see Neville's face.

 
"They see a boy on the stairs facing the window."
_HERMIONE
_Neville?
"Mad-Eye approaches Neville and pats him on the shoulder."
_MAD-EYE
_Son. You alright?
"Neville nods."
_MAD-EYE
_Come on, we'll have a cup of tea. I 
 want to show you something.

 
"INT. GOBLET ROOM Older students are placing their names into the flame and others  are applauding, Cedric is one of them."

_RON
_Eternal glory, be brilliant wouldn't 
 it? In three years from now we'll be 
 old enough to be choosen.

_HARRY
_Yeah well rather you than me.
"The twins come up cheering."
_GEORGE
_Thank you thank you, well lads we've 
 done it.

_FRED
_Cooked it up just this morning. 
_HERMIONE
_It's not going to work.
_FRED
_Oh yeah? And why's that Granger.
_HERMIONE
_You see this? This is an age line. Dumbledore 
 drew it himself.

_FRED
_So?
_HERMIONE
_So a genius like Dumbledore couldn't 
 possibly be fooled by something pathetically 
 dimwitted such as an age potion.

_GEORGE
_That's why it's so brilliant.
_GEORGE
_Ready Fred?
_FRED
_Ready George?
"They jump inside the age line, and cheer. They put their names  in the flame and do a high-five. The flame fires up and they're  flung across the room onto the floor. When they get up they have  full heads of grey hair and beards."

_GEORGE
_You said..
"Fred You said.. They roll around fighting on the floor and the crowd cheer. The  room suddenly becomes silent as Viktor Krum walks in and puts  his name in the flame. He looks at Hermione and she smiles."

 
 
"INT. GOBLET ROOM - THURSDAY NIGHT"
_DUMBLEDORE
_Sit down please. And now the moment 
 you've all been waiting for, the champions 
 selection! 

"Dumbledore approaches the blue flame and it glows red. A name  comes out. Everyone looks on anxiously."

_DUMBLEDORE
_The Durmstrang champion is ... Viktor 
_Krum!

"The Durmstrang crowd cheer. Another name comes out."
_DUMBLEDORE
_The champion from Beauxbatons... Fleur 
_Delacour

"The Beauxbatons girls cheer as Fleur walks up. Another name comes  out."

_DUMBLEDORE
_The Hogwarts champion... Cedric Diggory.

 
"Hogwarts pupils cheer as Cedric takes the stage."
_DUMBLEDORE
_Excellent! we now have our three champions! 
_But in the end only one will go down 
 in history. Only one will hoist this 
 chalice of champions, this vessel of 
 victory the tri-wizard cup!

"People cheer, but the goblet glows red once more and another  name flies out. Dumbledore takes it and reads..."

_DUMBLEDORE
_Harry Potter. Harry Potter? 
_HAGRID
_No... No.
_DUMBLEDORE
_Harry Potter!
_HERMIONE
_Go on Harry. Harry for goodness sake.

 
"Harry slowly walks up. Dumbledore gives him the paper. Voices  in the crowd shout out."

_VOICE
_He's a cheat! He's not even seventeen 
 yet.

 
"INT. ROOM Harry is in a room with the other champions. Dumbledore bursts  in and grabs Harry."

_DUMBLEDORE
_Harry! Did you put your name in the 
 goblet of fire?

_HARRY
_No sir.
_DUMBLEDORE
_Did you ask one of the older students 
 to do it for you?

_HARRY
_No sir.
_DUMBLEDORE
_You're absolutely sure?
_HARRY
_Yes sir.
_MADAME MAXIME
_Well of course he is lying.
_MAD-EYE
_The hell he is. The goblet of fire is 
 an exceptionally powerful magical object, 
 only an exceptionally powerful conjurer 
 could have hoodwinked it. Magic way 
 beyond the talents of a fourth year.

 
_IGOR
_You seem to have given this a fair bit 
 of thought Mad-Eye.

_MAD-EYE
_It was once my job to think as dark 
 wizards do Karkaroff perhaps you remember?

 
_DUMBLEDORE
_That doesn't help Alastor. Leave this 
 to you Barty.

_BARTY
_The rules are absolute, the goblet of 
 fire constitutes a binding magical contract. 
_Mr Potter has no choice, he is as of 
 tonight... a tri-wizards champion.

 
 
"INT. DARKENED TOWER ROOM"
_MCGONAGALL
_This can't go on Albus. First the dark 
 mark, now this?

_DUMBLEDORE
_What do you suggest Minerva?
_MCGONAGALL
_Put an end to it. Don't let Potter compete.

 
_DUMBLEDORE
_You heard Barty the rules are clear.

 
_MCGONAGALL
_Well the devil with Barty and his rules. 
_And since when did you accomodate them...

 
_SEVERUS
_Master I too find it difficult to believe 
 this mere coincidence, if we are to 
 truly discover the meaning of these 
 events perhaps we should for the time 
 being let them unfold.

_MCGONAGALL
_Do nothing?? Offer him up as bait? Potter 
 is a boy not a piece of meat.

_DUMBLEDORE
_I agree with Severus. Alastor, keep 
 an eye on Harry will you?

_MAD-EYE
_I can do that.
_DUMBLEDORE
_Don't let him know though, he must be 
 anxious enough as it is... knowing what 
 lies ahead. Then again, we all are.

 
 
"INT. BEDROOM"
_RON
_How did you do it?
"Harry is silent."
_RON
_Never mind. Doesn't matter. You could 
 have let your best friend know though.

 
_HARRY
_Let you know what?
_RON
_You know bloody well what.
_HARRY
_I didn't ask for this to happen Ron. 
_Okay? You're being stupid.

_RON
_Yeah that's me, Ron Weasley... Harry 
_Potter's stupid friend.

_HARRY
_I didn't put my name in that cup. I 
 don't WANT eternal glory I just wanna 
 be.. Look, I don't know what happened 
 tonight and I don't know why, it just 
 did ok.

_RON
_Piss off.
 
"INT. HOGWARTS A woman appears in a puff of smoke. She's well groomed and dressed  colorfully."

_RITA
_What a charismatic quartet. Hello!

 
"The four tri-wizard champions are stood together in a group.  She walks over to them and shakes each of their hands."

_RITA
_I'm Rita Skeeter, I write for the daily 
 prophet. But of course you know that 
 don't you. It's you we don't know, you're 
 the news. What quirks lurk beneath those 
 rosy cheeks? what mysteries do the muscles 
 mask? does courage lie beneath those 
 curls? In short, what makes a champion 
 tick. Me, myself and I want to know. 
_Not to mention my rabid readers. So, 
 who's feeling up to sharing? Mmm? Shall 
 we start with the youngest. Lovely.

 
"She takes Harry by the hand into a closet."
_RITA
_This is cosy.
_HARRY
_It's a broomcupboard.
_RITA
_You should feel right at home then. 
_Don't mind if I use the quill do you?

 
_HARRY
_Oh, no.
_RITA
_So Harry, here you sit, a mere boy of 
 twelve..

_HARRY
_I'm fourteen.
_RITA
 ...about to compete against three students. 
_Not only vastly more emotionally mature 
 than yourself but have mastered spells 
 that you wouldn't attempt in your dizziest 
 daydreams. Concerned?

_HARRY
_I dunno I haven't really thought about 
 it.

_RITA
_Course you're not just any ordinary 
 boy of twelve are you...

_HARRY
_Fourteen.
_RITA
_The story's legend. Do you think it 
 was the trauma of your past that made 
 you so keen to enter such a dangerous 
 tournament.

_HARRY
_No I didn't enter.
_RITA
_Course you didn't. Everyone loves a 
 rebel Harry. (to the quill) Scratch 
 that last. Speaking of your parents, 
 were they alive, how do you think they'd 
 feel? proud? or concerned that your 
 attitude shows at best a pathological 
 need for attention, at worst a psychotic 
 deathwish.

_HARRY
(looking at the notepad) Hey, my eyes 
 aren't glistening with the ghosts of 
 my past. 

 
"INT. ROOFTOP An owl flies in with a letter for Harry, he takes it and begins  to read."

_SIR
(VOICEOVER) Harry. I couldn't risk sending 
_Edward. It was since the world cup and 
 the ministry's been intercepting more 
 and more owls and she's too easily recognised. 
_We need to talk Harry. Face to face. 
_Meet me in the Griffindore common room 
 at one o clock this Saturday night and 
 make sure you're alone. P.S....

"The owl nips Harry's finger."
_HARRY
_AGH!
_SIR
(VOICEOVER CONT'D) The bird bites.

 
 
"INT. GRIFFINDORE COMMON ROOM"
_HARRY
_Sirius?
"Harry picks up a newspaper, the headline reads "THE CHAMPIONS  ARE SELECTED" and reads."

_RITA
(VOICEOVER) Harry Potter aged 12, suspect 
 entrant in the tri-wizard tournament. 
_His eyes swimming with the ghosts of 
 his...

"Her voice becomes desperate as he crumples up the newspaper and  puts it on the fire. The fire flares up a little, a face appears  in it."

_HARRY
_Sirius?! How...
_SIR
_I don't have much time Harry so let 
 me get straight to it. Did you or did 
 you not put your name into the goblet 
 of fire?

_HARRY
_No!
_SIR
_Shh... I had to ask. Now, tell me about 
 this dream of yours. You mentioned Wormtail 
 and Voldemort, but who was the third 
 man in the room?

_HARRY
_I dunno.
_SIR
_You didn't hear a name?
_HARRY
_No. Umm.. Voldemort was giving him a 
 job to do. Something important.

_SIR
_What was that?
_HARRY
_He wanted... me. I dunno why, but he 
 was gonna use this man to get to me. 
_I mean it was only a dream right?

 
_SIR
_Yes. It's just a dream. Look Harry, 
 the deatheaters at the world cup, your 
 name rising from that goblet these are 
 not just coincidences. Hogwarts isn't 
 safe any more.

_HARRY
_What are you saying?
_SIR
_I'm saying the devils are inside the 
 walls. Igor Karkaroff, he was a deatheater. 
_And no one, no one stops being a deatheater. 
_Then there's Barty Crouch, heart of 
 stone, sent his OWN son to Azkaban.

 
_HARRY
_Do you think one of them put my name 
 in the goblet?

_SIR
_I haven't a clue who put your name in 
 that goblet Harry but whoever did it 
 is no friend to you. People die in this 
 tournament.

_HARRY
_I'm not ready for this Sirius.
_SIR
_You don't have a choice.
_HARRY
_Someone's coming!
_SIR
_Keep your friends close Harry.
"Ron enters the room."
_RON
_Who you talking to?
_HARRY
_Who says I was talking to anyone.
_RON
_I heard voices. 
_HARRY
_Maybe you're imagining things, wouldn't 
 be the first time.

_RON
_You're probably just practicing for 
 your next interview I expect.

"Ron leaves. Harry goes to the fire again but Sirius is gone.  The newspaper in the fire has the headline "TEENAGE TRAGEDY"."

 
 
"EXT. LAKESIDE"
_NEVILLE
_Amazing. Amazing.
_HARRY
_Neville! You're doing it again!
_NEVILLE
_Oh, right sorry.
_HARRY
(reading a book) Magical water plants 
 of the highland Lochs?

_NEVILLE
_Moody gave it to me. That day we had 
 tea.

"Neville waves. Hermione and Ron are walking up to them."
_HERMIONE
(Whispering to Ron) We've already been 
 through enough people why don't you 
 just go and do it yourself? Ughh. What 
 do you want me to say again?

"Ron whispers some words to Hermione. It's clear Ron and Harry  are not on speaking terms."

"Hermione walks up to Harry."
_HERMIONE
_Ronald would like me to tell you that 
_Seamus told him that Dean was told by 
_Parvati that Hagrid was looking for 
 you.

_HARRY
_Is that right? Well.... what?
_HERMIONE
_Uhhh...
"She walks back to Ron for more whispering and comes back."
_HERMIONE
_Dean was told by Parvati that... Please 
 don't ask me say it again. Hagrid's 
 looking for you.

_HARRY
_Well you can tell Ronald...
_HERMIONE
_I'm NOT an owl!
 
"INT. FOREST Harry and Hagrid are walking through a dark forest."
_HAGRID
_Did you bring your father's cloak like 
_I asked you?

_HARRY
_Yeah I brought the cloak. Hagrid where 
 are we going?

_HAGRID
_You'll see soon enough. Pay attention 
 this is important.

_HARRY
_What's with the flower? Hagrid have 
 you combed your hair?

"Hagrid is looking more dapper than usual and is carrying a big  red flower."

_HAGRID
_As a matter of fact I have. You might 
 like to try the same thing now and again.

 
"We hear animal noises. Madame Maxime calls out to Hagrid."
_MADAME MAXIME
_Hagrid?
_HAGRID
_Oh, the cloak. Put the cloak on.
"Harry does as he's told."
_HAGRID
_Bonsoir Olympe.
_MADAME MAXIME
_Oh Hagrid. I thought you weren't coming, 
_I thought perhaps... you had... forgotten 
 me.

_HAGRID
_Couldn't forget you Olympe.
_MADAME MAXIME
_What is it you want to show me? When 
 we spoke earlier you sounded so exhilirated.

 
_HAGRID
_You'll be glad you came. Trust me.

 
"A dragon nearby gives a loud roar."
_MADAME MAXIME
_Ahh, c'est magnifique!
"In an opening we see people are running about, dragons are roaring  and breathing fire."

_MADAME MAXIME
_Can we get closer?
_HARRY
_Dragons? That's the first task? You're 
 joking.

_HAGRID
_Come on Harry. They're seriously misunderstood 
 creatures. 

"A huge flame fires up."
_HAGRID
_Although, I have to admit that horntail 
 is a right nasty piece of work. Poor 
_Ron nearly fainted just seeing him you 
 know.

_HARRY
_Ron was here?
_HAGRID
_Oh sure. His brother Charlie helped 
 bring him over from Romania. Didn't 
_Ron tell you that?

_HARRY
_No he didn't. He didn't tell me a thing.

 
 
"EXT. HOGWARTS - DAYTIME We're zoomed in on a badge, it depicts Cedric on a bright yellow  background. Then the badge spins and shows Harry on a green background  with the words "Potter Stinks" on it. As Harry walks along other  pupils aim insults at him saying he stinks. A young boy runs  past."

_BOY
_Cedric rules!
_HARRY
_Thanks.
"Harry gets to a doorway, two pupils stand in his way."
_BOY
_Like the badge?
_HARRY
_Excuse me..
"They laugh, Harry pushes his way through. He approaches Cedric  who is standing around with his friends. Cedric's friends hurl  off more insults."

_HARRY
(to Cedric) Can I have a word?
_CEDRIC
_Alright.
"They walk away some distance."
_HARRY
_Dragons. That's the first task. They've 
 got one for each of us.

_CEDRIC
_Are you serious? And Fleur and Krum, 
 do they...?

_HARRY
_Yes.
_CEDRIC
_Right. Hey listen, about the badges. 
_I've asked them not to wear them.

 
_HARRY
_Don't worry about it.
"Ron and Seamus are walking along. Harry approaches them."
_HARRY
(To Ron) You're a right foul git you 
 know that?

_RON
_You think so?
_HARRY
_I know so.
_RON
_Anything else?
_HARRY
_Yeah. Stay away from me.
_RON
_Fine.
 
"Draco calls out, he's sitting up a tree."
_DRACO
_Why so tense Potter? My father and I 
 have a bet you see. I don't think you're 
 gonna last ten minutes in this tournament. 
_He disagrees. He thinks you won't last 
_FIVE.

_HARRY
_I don't give a damn what you or your 
 father thinks Malfoy. He's vile and 
 cruel, and you're just pathetic.

"Harry walks away and Draco angrily tries casting a spell. Mad-Eye  appears and quickly turns Malfoy into a ferret."

_MAD-EYE
_I'll teach you to cast when someone's 
 back is turned.

_MCGONAGALL
_Professor Moody what are you doing?

 
_MAD-EYE
_Teaching.
_MCGONAGALL
_Is that a student?
_MAD-EYE
_Technically it's a ferret.
"Mad-Eye is making the ferret hover around. He sends it up the  trouser leg of one of Draco's friends. He squirms and looks uncomfortable.  Everyone else is laughing. Mad-Eye winks to Harry and he laughs.  Eventually it comes back out and McGonagall turns Draco back  to normal."

_DRACO
_My father will hear about this!
_MAD-EYE
_Is that a threat! 
"Draco runs away. Mad-Eye shouts after him."
_MAD-EYE
_I could tell you stories about your 
 father that would curl even your greasy 
 hair boy! It doesn't end here!

_MCGONAGALL
_We never use transfigration as a punishment, 
 surely Dumbledore told you that.

_MAD-EYE
_He might've mentioned it.
_MCGONAGALL
_Well you will do well to remember it.

 
_MAD-EYE
(To Harry) come with me.
 
"INT. MAD-EYE'S ROOM Mad-Eye takes off his prosthetic leg and takes a seat."
_MAD-EYE
_That's a foal glass. Lets me keep an 
 eye on my enemies. If I can see the 
 whites of their eyes they're standing 
 right behind me.

"A noise emerges from a trunk on the floor and it shakes."
_MAD-EYE
_Wouldn't even bother telling you what's 
 in ther. You wouldn't believe it if 
_I did. Now... what are you going to 
 do about your dragon?

_HARRY
_Oh... um... You know I just thought 
_I'd...

_MAD-EYE
_Sit. Listen to me Potter. Your pal Diggory, 
 by your age he could take a whistle 
 into a watch and have it sing you the 
 time. Miss Delacour, she's as much a 
 fairy princess as I am. As for Krum, 
 his head may be filled with sawdust 
 but Karkaroff's is NOT. They'll have 
 a strategy, and you can bet that it'll 
 play to Krum's strengths. Hmm? Come 
 on Potter. What are your strengths?

 
_HARRY
_Um... I dunno.. I can fly. I mean I'm 
 a fair flyer.

_MAD-EYE
_Better than fair the way I heard it.

 
_HARRY
_But I'm not allowed a broom.
_MAD-EYE
_You're allowed a wand.
 
"EXT. ARENA - TOURNAMENT STAGE The crowds are cheering, people are taking bets."
 
"INT. WAITING TENT Harry is pacing nervously. Hermione is standing by the tent door  whispering in."

_HERMIONE
_Pssst! Harry? Is that you?
_HARRY
_Yeah.
_HERMIONE
_How are you feeling? OK? The key is 
 to concentrate. After that you just 
 have to...

_HARRY
_Battle a dragon.
"Hermione enters the tent and they hug. A bright camera flashes,  Rita Skeeter the journalist approaches."

_RITA
_Young love! Ohh how.. stirring. If everything 
 goes unfortunately today you might make 
 the front page.

_VIKTOR
(To Rita) You have no business here. 
_This tent is for champions and friends.

 
_RITA
_No matter. We've got what we wanted.

 
"Rita leaves and Dumbledore enters."
_DUMBLEDORE
_Good day champions. Gather round please. 
_Now you've waited, you've wondered and 
 at last the moment has arrived. The 
 moment only four of you can fully appreciate.

 
"The champions gather around him in a circle."
_DUMBLEDORE
_What are you doing here Miss Granger?

 
_HERMIONE
_Oh um.. Sorry I'll just go.
_DUMBLEDORE
_Barty. The bag.
_BARTY
_Champions, in a circle around me. Miss 
_Delacour over here, Mr Krum, and Potter 
 over here. Right. Miss Delacour, if 
 you will...

"Barty holds up a bag. Fleur takes out a little green dragon."

 
_BARTY
_The welsh green. Mr Krum...
"Viktor takes another out"
_BARTY
_The chinese fireball. Oooooh.
"Cedric picks one. "
_BARTY
_The swedish short-snout. Which leaves... 
 

_HARRY
_The horntail...
_BARTY
_What's that boy?
_HARRY
_Nothing.
"Harry puts his hand in the bag and pulls out the dragon."
_BARTY
_The hungarian horntail. These represent 
 very real dragons, each of which has 
 been given a golden egg to protect. 
_Your objective is simple, collect the 
 egg. This you must do, for each egg 
 contains a clue without which you cannot 
 hope to proceed to the next task. Any 
 questions?

_DUMBLEDORE
_Very well. Good luck champions. Mr Diggory 
 the sound of the cannon...

"The cannon fires immediately. Transcribed by IMSDb.com"
 
"INT. TENT  Harry is sitting alone nervously."
_DUMBLEDORE
(VOICEOVER THE LOUDSPEAKER) Three of 
 our champions have now faced their dragons 
 and so each one of them will proceed 
 to the next task. And now our fourth 
 and final contestant.

"Harry enters the rocky arena. The crowd are cheering his name.  He sees the golden egg sitting alone, he makes a run for it but  the dragon appears. Harry's forced to retreat behind a rock as  the dragon flames him. Harry stumbles and falls around the arena."

 
_HERMIONE
_Your wand harry! Your wand!
"Harry summons a broom. He jumps on and flies off, the dragon  gives chase. The dragon bursts through the crowd and they look  stunned."

 
"EXT. HOGWARTS SKY Harry is flying at high speed around the Hogwarts buildings.  The dragon cuts him off and whips him off his broom, he lands  on the roof of Hogwarts, hanging on for dear life. The dragon  is clambering across the roof, strewing tiles as it goes. Harry  reaches his broom but it's stuck. He jerks it loose and lets  go of the roof just in time before the dragon swipes at him.  He falls a long way but regains control. He flies on to an area  with a bridge, he flies through a gap in the bridge but the dragon  crashes into it and falls into the water."

 
"INT. ARENA The crowds are mostly silent. We see Harry flying towards us  and the crowd erupts. He goes straight for the golden egg."

 
 
"INT. HOGWARTS Harry is lifting the golden egg, people around him cheering.  The Weasly twins have Harry sitting on their shoulders."

_GEORGE
_We knew you wouldn't die Harry.
_FRED
_Lose a leg.
_GEORGE
_Or an arm.
_FRED
_Pack it in altogether.
_TWINS
_NEVER!
_SEAMUS
_Go on Harry, what's the clue?
"Seamus hands Harry the golden egg."
_HARRY
_Who wants me to open it? You want me 
 to open it?

"He opens the egg and a loud horrific screech comes out, he closes  it again."

_HARRY
_What the bloody hell was that?
"Ron appears in the doorway."
_FRED
_Alright everyone, go back to your knitting. 
_This is gonna be uncomfortable enough 
 without all you nosey sods listening 
 in.

_RON
_I reckon you'd have to be barking mad 
 to put your own name in the goblet of 
 fire.

_HARRY
_Caught on have you. Took you long enough.

 
_RON
_Wasn't just me who thought you'd done 
 it. Everyone was saying it behind your 
 back.

_HARRY
_Brilliant. That makes me feel loads 
 better.

_RON
_At least I warned you about the dragons.

 
_HARRY
_Hagrid warned me about the dragons.

 
_RON
_Oh no no, I did. Don't you remember? 
_I told Hermione to tell you that Seamus 
 told me that Parvati told Dean that 
_Hagrid was looking for you. Seamus never 
 actually told me anything, so it was 
 really me all along. I thought you'd 
 be alright, you know, after you figured 
 that out.

_HARRY
_Who could possibly figure that out? 
_That's completely mental.

_RON
_Yeah it is isn't it. Suppose I was a 
 bit distraught.

_HERMIONE
_Boys.
 
"INT. CLASSROOM Harry is looking at Cho. When she looks back he spills drink  from his mouth. They laugh at him."

_HERMIONE
(Reading a newspaper) Look at this! 
_I can't believe it she's done it again. 
_Miss Granger a plain but ambitious girl 
 seems to be developing a taste for famous 
 wizards. Her latest prey sources report 
 is none other than the Bulgarian bon-bon 
_Viktor Krum. No word yet on how Harry 
_Potter's taking this latest emotional 
 blow.

"A young boy walks up holding a package."
_NIGEL
_Parcel for you Mr Weasley.
_RON
_Thank you Nigel. 
"Nigel is gazing at Harry."
_RON
_Not now Nigel. Later. Go on.
"Nigel leaves."
_RON
_I told him I'd get him Harry's autograph. 
_Oh look mum's sent me something. Mum 
 sent me a dress??

_HARRY
_Well it does match your eyes. Is there 
 a bonnet?

_RON
_Ginny these must be for you.
_GINNY
_I'm not wearing that it's ghastly.

 
"Hermione laughs."
_RON
_What are you on about?
_HERMIONE
_They're not for Ginny they're for you! 
_Dress robes.

_RON
_Dress robes? for what?
 
"INT. ASSEMBLY ROOM"
_MCGONAGALL
_The yule ball has been a tradition of 
 the tri-wizard tournament since its 
 inception. On Christmas eve night we 
 and our guests gather in the great hall 
 for well mannered frivolity. As representitives 
 of the host school I expect each and 
 every one of you to put your best foot 
 forward, and I mean this literally because 
 the yule ball is first and foremost... 
 a dance. 

"Groans emerge from the boys who are listening on. The girls seem  a lot more excited."

_MCGONAGALL
_Silence. The house of Godrick Griffindore 
 has commanded the respect of the wizard 
 world for nearly ten centuries. I will 
 not have you in the course of a single 
 evening besmirching that name by behaving 
 like a babbling, bumbling band of baboons.

 
_FRED
(Whispering to George) Try saying that 
 five times faster.

"They try."
_MCGONAGALL
(Continued) Now to dance is to let the 
 body breathe, inside every girl a secret 
 swan slumbers longing to burst forth 
 and take flight.

_RON
(Whispering to Seamus) Something's about 
 to burst out of Hilary but I don't think 
 it's a swan.

_MCGONAGALL
_Inside every boy a lordly lion prepared 
 to prance. Mr Weasly, will you join 
 me.

"She grabs Ron and pulls him up to dance. "
_MCGONAGALL
_Now, place your right hand on my waist.

 
_RON
_Where?
_MCGONAGALL
_My waist. 
"He does so and a wolf whistle comes from the crowd."
_MCGONAGALL
_Now bend your arm. Mr Filch...
"The music starts."
_MCGONAGALL
_One two three, one two three, one two 
 three.

_HARRY
(To the Weasly twins) Oi! Never gonna 
 let him forget this are you?

_TWINS
_Never.
_MCGONAGALL
_Everybody come together.
"The girls instantly stand and walk forward, the boys are all  still seated."

_MCGONAGALL
_Boys, on your feet.
"Neville stands."
 
"EXT. HOGWARTS - DAYTIME"
_HARRY
_Why do they always have to travel in 
 packs? How are you supposed to get one 
 alone to ask them...

_RON
_Blimey Harry, you slayed dragons. If 
 you can't get a date who can?

_HARRY
_I think I'd take the dragon right now.

 
"Groups of girls are giving them icy looks and turning their backs."

 
 
"INT. HOGWARTS Hagrid and Madame Maxime are walking together."
_HAGRID
_I take after my mum. Though I didn't 
 know her very well, she left when I 
 was about three. No, not the maternal 
 sort her, broke my dad's heart though. 
_You know he was a tiny little fellow 
 my dad, I could pick him up with one 
 hand by the age of six and put him up 
 in the dresser.

"They laugh together and have a moment."
_HAGRID
_And then he died when I was still in 
 school. So I had to make me own way 
 as it were. But enough of me, what about 
 you!

 
"EXT. LAKESIDE Viktor Krum is training, a group of girls are following him around."

 
 
"INT. CLASSROOM"
_RON
_This is mad. At this rate we'll be the 
 only ones in our year without dates.

 
"Severus Snape walks past and slaps Ron over the head. "
_RON
_Well, us and Neville!
_HARRY
_But then again he can take himself.

 
_HERMIONE
_It might interest you to know that Neville's 
 already got someone.

"Ron gasps."
_RON
_Now I'm really depressed.
"Fred hands Ron a note, it reads "GET A MOVE ON OR ALL THE GOOD  ONES WILL HAVE GONE!"."

_RON
_Well Hermione, you're a girl.
_HERMIONE
_Oh well spotted.
_RON
_Come on. It's one thing for a bloke 
 to show up alone. For a girl it's just 
 sad.

_HERMIONE
_I won't be going alone because believe 
 it or not someone's asked me. And I 
 said yes.

_RON
_Bloody hell.
"Hermione storms off."
_RON
_Look. We've just got to grit our teeth 
 and do it. Tonight when we get back 
 to the common room, we'll both have 
 partners. Agreed?

_HARRY
_Agreed.
 
"EXT. HOGWARTS - SNOWY Harry is walking up some steps. He reaches the top and bumps  into Cho who has come around the corner."

_CHO
_Harry!
_HARRY
_Cho!
_CHO
_Watch yourself on the stairs, it's a 
 bit icey at the top.

_HARRY
_Ok thanks. Cho?
_CHO
_Yes?
_HARRY
_Um. (Mumbling) I just wondered if maybe 
 you wanted to go to the ball with me?

 
_CHO
_Sorry? I didn't catch that.
_HARRY
_Um. I was just wondering if maybe you 
 wanted to go to the ball with me.

 
_CHO
_Oh. Um. Harry I'm sorry but someone's 
 already asked me. And well I've said 
_I'll go with him.

_HARRY
_Ok. Great. Fine. No problem. Good.

 
_CHO
_Harry I really am sorry.
 
"INT. COMMON ROOM Ron is being helped into the room, he looks shaky."
_HARRY
_What happened to you?
_GIRL
_He just asked Fleur Delacour out.
_HERMIONE
_What?
_HARRY
_What did she say?
_HERMIONE
_No of course.
"Ron shakes his head. "
_HERMIONE
_She said yes??
_HARRY
_Don't be silly.
_RON
_There she was walking by. You know I 
 like it when they walk. I couldn't help 
 it, it just sort of slipped out.

_GIRL
_Actually he sort of screamed at her, 
 it was a bit frightening.

_HARRY
_What did you do then?
_RON
_What else? I ran for it. I'm not cut 
 out for this Harry. I don't know what 
 got into me.

"The Patil twins walk past."
_PATILS
_Hi Harry.
_HARRY
_Hey!
 
"INT. DANCEHALL Soft music plays and everyone is well dressed, gathered in the  hall. "

 
"ELSEWHERE Ron is getting dressed in front of a mirror. He looks paniced  and uncomfortable in his ridiculous dress robes."

_RON
_Bloody hell.
"Harry walks in, he's dressed in a more conventional suit."
_RON
_What are those??
_HARRY
_My dress robes.
_RON
_Well they're alright. No lace, no dodgy 
 little collar. 

_HARRY
_Well I expect yours are more traditional.

 
_RON
_Traditional?? They're ancient! I look 
 like my great aunt Tessie.

"He sniffs at his clothes."
_RON
_I smell like my great aunt Tessie. Murder 
 me Harry.

 
"INT. DANCEHALL Harry and Ron are walking down the stairs into the hall. Ron  is fidgeting with his outfit."

_HARRY
_Leave it alone.
_RON
_Poor kid, bet she's alone in her room 
 crying her eyes out.

_HARRY
_Who?
_RON
_Hermione of course. Come on Harry, why'd 
 you think she wouldn't tell us who she's 
 coming with?

_HARRY
_Because we'd take the mickey out of 
 her if she did.

_RON
_Because nobody asked her. I would have 
 taken her myself if she weren't so bleeding 
 proud.

"The boys approach the Patil twins."
_PARVATI
_Hello boys. Don't you look...
"She looks at Ron."
_PARVATI
 ... dashing.
_MCGONAGALL
_Here you are Potter. Are you and Miss 
_Patil ready?

_HARRY
_Ready professor?
_MCGONAGALL
_To dance. It's traditional that the 
 three champions or in this case four 
 are the first to dance. Surely I told 
 you that.

_HARRY
_No.
_MCGONAGALL
_Oh well now you know. Oh, as for your 
_Mr Weasly you may proceed into the great 
 hall with Miss Patil.

"Hermione enters the room all dressed up."
_PARVATI
_She looks beautiful.
_HARRY
_Yeah she does.
"Hermione walks down the stairs. Viktor Krum takes her hand and  they walk together."

_PADMA
(To Ron) Is that Hermione Granger? With 
_Viktor Krum??

_RON
_No. Absolutely not.
"Loud music plays as the champions head to the dancefloor with  their partners."

_PARVATI
_Harry. Take my waist.
_HARRY
_What?
_PARVATI
_Now.
"They dance. Soon others are joining in, Dumbledore and McGonagall,  Mr Filch and his cat, Hagrid and Madame Maxime. Mad-Eye sits  on the sidelines drinking. The scene changes, the music is now  rock played by the Weird Sisters fronted by Jarvis Cocker from  Pulp. Cool!. The crowd is jumping. Harry, Ron and their dates  are sitting some distance away looking miserable. Hermione comes  up after a great time with Viktor."

_HERMIONE
_Hot isn't it? Viktor's gone to get drinks. 
_Care to join us?

_RON
_No, we'd NOT care to join you and Viktor.

 
_HERMIONE
_What's got your wand in a knot?
_RON
_He's a Durmstrang. You're fraternising 
 with the enemy.

_HERMIONE
_The enemy?? Who was it wanting his autograph? 
_Besides, the whole point of the tournament 
 is international magical cooperation, 
 to make friends.

_RON
_Hrmph, I think he's got a bit more than 
 friendship on his mind.

"Hermione walks off."
_PADMA
_Are you going to ask me to dance or 
 not?

_RON
_No.
 
"LATER"
_RON
(To Hermione) He's using you.
_HERMIONE
_How dare you! Besides I can take care 
 of myself.

_RON
_Doubt it. He's way too old.
_HERMIONE
_What? What? That's what you think?

 
_RON
_Yeah that is what I think.
_HERMIONE
_You know the solution then don't you.

 
_RON
_Go on.
_HERMIONE
_Next time there's a ball pluck up the 
 courage and ask me before somebody else 
 does, and not as a last resort.

_RON
_Well that's completely off the point. 
_Harry...

"Harry walks up."
_HERMIONE
_Where have you been? Nevermind! Off 
 to bed both of you.

"Harry and Ron walk away."
_RON
_They get scary when they get older.

 
_HERMIONE
_Ron you spoil everything!
 
"INT. BEDROOM NIGHTMARE SEQUENCE We're back in the old house. "
_VOLDERMORT
_Let me see it again.
"A sleeve is rolled up and a marking of a skull and snake in on  the arm."

_VOLDEMORT
_Ah yes, the time is close now. Harry! 
_At last! Step aside Wormtail so I can 
 give our guest a proper greeting!

 
"Harry wakes up. The floorboards are creaking, someone is walking  up to his bed. It's Neville."

_NEVILLE
_You alright Harry? I just got in. Me!

 
"He chuckles and dances off."
 
"EXT. A BRIDGE OUTSIDE HOGWARTS"
_HERMIONE
_Harry you told me you'd figured the 
 egg out weeks ago. The task is two days 
 from now.

_HARRY
_Really? I had no idea. I suppose Viktor's 
 already figured it out.

_HERMIONE
_I wouldn't know, we didn't actually 
 talk about the tournament. Actually 
 we didn't really talk at all, Viktor's 
 more of a physical being. I just mean 
 he's not particularly... Mostly he watches 
 me study. It's a bit annoying actually. 
_You are trying to figure this egg out 
 aren't you?

_HARRY
_What's that supposed to mean?
_HERMIONE
_I mean these tasks are supposed to test 
 you, in the most brutal way they're 
 almost cruel. And um, I'm scared for 
 you. You got by the dragon mostly on 
 nerve, I'm not sure it's going to be 
 enough this time.

_CEDRIC
_Hey Potter. 
_HARRY
_Cedric.
_CEDRIC
_How are you?
_HARRY
_Spectacular.
_CEDRIC
_Look I realise I never really thanked 
 you properly for tipping me off about 
 those dragons.

_HARRY
_Forget about it. I'm sure you would 
 have done the same for me.

_CEDRIC
_Exactly. You know the prefects bathroom 
 on the fifth floor?

"Harry nods."
_CEDRIC
_It's not a bad place for a bath. Just 
 take your egg and mull things over in 
 the hot water.

 
"INT. BATHROOM Harry is taking his clothes off, he gets in the bath. He has  his golden egg on the side."

_HARRY
_I must be out of my mind.
"He opens the egg and the horrible screech noise comes out."
_MYRTLE
_I'd try putting it in the water if I 
 were you.

_HARRY
_Myrtle!
_MYRTLE
_Long time no see.
"The ghostly figure of little Myrtle flies around."
_MYRTLE
_I was circling a blocked drain the other 
 day and could swear I saw a bit of polyjuice 
 potion. Not being a bad boy again are 
 you Harry?

_HARRY
_Polyjuice potion! Kicked the habit. 
_Myrtle, did you say try putting it in 
 the water?

"Myrtle flies around again and gets in the water."
_MYRTLE
_Well. That's what he did. The other 
 boy, the handsome one. Cedric.

"Harry takes the egg and puts it under the water."
_MYRTLE
_Well go on, open it.
"Harry does so and goes underwater himself. He hears a voice singing."

 
_VOICE SINGING
_Come seek us where our voices sound. 
_We cannot sing above the ground. An 
 hour long you'll have to look, to recover 
 what we took.

_HARRY
_Myrtle, there aren't Merpeople in the 
 black lake are there?

_MYRTLE
_Ahhh, very good. Took Cedric ages to 
 riddle it out. Almost all the bubbles 
 were gone...

"Myrtle laughs and Harry is embarrassed."
 
"INT. COMMON ROOM"
_HERMIONE
_Harry, tell me again.
_HARRY
_Come seek us where our voices sound.

 
_HERMIONE
_The black lake, that's obvious.
_HARRY
_An hour long you'll have to look.
_HERMIONE
_Again obvious, though I must admit potentially 
 problematic 

_HARRY
_Potentially problematic? When was the 
 last time you held your breath under 
 the water for an hour Hermione?

_HERMIONE
_Look Harry, we can do this. The three 
 of us can figure it out.

"Mad-Eye Moody appears in the doorway."
_MAD-EYE
_Hate to break up this scholar session 
 but Professor McGonagall would like 
 to see you in her office. Not you Potter, 
 just Weasly and Granger.

_HERMIONE
_But sir, the second task is only hours 
 away and...

_MAD-EYE
_Exactly. Presumably Potter is well prepared 
 by now and could do with a good night's 
 sleep. Go. Now! Longbottom!

"Neville appears from behind a bookcase."
_MAD-EYE
_Why don't you help Potter put his books 
 back.

_NEVILLE
_You know, if you're interested in plants 
 you'd be better with Gorshok's Guide 
 to Herbology. Do you know there's a 
 wizard in Nepal whose growing gravity 
 resistant trees?

_HARRY
_Neville. No offense, but I really don't 
 care about plants. Now if there's a 
_Tibetan turnip that will allow me to 
 breathe underwater for an hour then 
 great.

_NEVILLE
_I don't know about a turnip but you 
 can always use gilliweed.

 
"EXT. LAKESIDE The Weasly twins are shouting, busy taking bets. Harry is walking  along with Neville, he has some green plantlife in his hand."

 
_HARRY
_You're sure about this Neville.
_NEVILLE
_Absolutely.
_HARRY
_For an hour.
_NEVILLE
_Most likely.
_HARRY
_Most likely?
_NEVILLE
_Well there is some debate among herbologists 
 as to the effects of freshwater versus 
 saltwater.

_HARRY
_You're telling me this now? You must 
 be joking.

_NEVILLE
_I just wanted to help.
_HARRY
_Well that makes you sight better than 
_Ron and Hermione. Where are they anyway?

 
_NEVILLE
_You seem a little tense Harry.
_HARRY
_Do I?
_DUMBLEDORE
(Over a loudspeaker) Welcome to the 
 second task. Last night something was 
 stolen from each of our champions. A 
 treasure of sorts. These four treasures, 
 one for each champion, now lie on the 
 bottom of the black lake. In order to 
 win each champion need only find their 
 treasure and return to the surface. 
_Simple enough. Except for this, they 
 will have one hour to do so and one 
 hour only. After that they'll be on 
 their own.

_MAD-EYE
(To Harry) Put that in your mouth.

 
"Harry puts the gilliweed in his mouth and starts choking."
_DUMBLEDORE
(Continued) You may begin at the start 
 of the cannon.

"The cannon fires and the champions enter the water, three of  them dive in while Harry is pushed. Underwater the effects of  gilliweed take hold, Harry's hands and feet become webbed. "

 
 
"EXT. ABOVE WATER"
_SEAMUS
_What's the matter with him?
_FRIEND
_I don't know I can't see him.
_NEVILLE
_Oh my god I've killed Harry Potter!

 
"Harry flies into the air like a dolphin and the crowd cheer."

 
 
"EXT. UNDERWATER Harry swims among the fish and rocks. Singing voices start echoing.  We see Fleur get trapped, she screams. "

 
"EXT. ABOVE WATER"
_DUMBLEDORE
(Over the loudspeaker) The Beauxbatons 
 champion Miss Delacour has unfortunately 
 been forced to retire. She will take 
 no further part in this task. 

 
"EXT. UNDERWATER Harry is still searching around. He hears muffled screams. He  finds Ron, Hermione, Cho Chan and a blonde girl from Beauxbatons  tied in place by their ankles. Cedric is there, he takes Cho  with him. Harry sets about freeing Ron and Hermione but vicious  merpeople appear."

_HARRY
_But she's my friend too!
_MERPERSON
_Only one.
"What looks like a shark approaches at high speed. We see that  it has legs and it's Viktor. He takes Hermione and heads for  the surface. Harry frees Ron. "

 
"EXT. ABOVE WATER Cedric and Cho emerge, the crowd cheers. Viktor and Hermione  next, the crows chants 'Krum, Krum, Krum'. The Beauxbatons girls  look worried."

 
"EXT. UNDERWATER Harry looks over and sees the blonde girl that Fleur was unable  to rescue. He loosens her rope too and starts heading for the  surface with the both of them. He's attacked and gets held down,  he pushes Ron and the girl towards the surface."

 
"EXT. ABOVE WATER Ron and the girl come up, they are coughing but safe. They're  helped out of the water by a girl from Beauxbatons. Underwater  Harry casts a spell which propels him towards the surface, he  flies out and lands on the decking where the crowd are."

_DUMBLEDORE
_Harry! 
_BARTY
_Get him another towel.
_DUMBLEDORE
_I want all the judges over here now.

 
_FLEUR
(To Harry) You saved her, even though 
 she wasn't yours to save. My little 
 sister!

"Fleur kisses Harry on the face."
_FLEUR
_Thank you! And you... (Looks to Ron). 
_You helped!

_RON
_Well... yeah... a bit
"Fleur kisses him too."
_RON
_Merci.
"Hermione comes up to Harry with a towel."
_HERMIONE
_Harry!
_HARRY
_Hermione
_HERMIONE
_Are you alright? You must be freezing! 
_Personally I think you behaved admirably.

 
"Hermione kisses Harry on the head."
_HARRY
_I finished last Hermione.
_HERMIONE
_Next to last.
_DUMBLEDORE
_Attention! Attention! The winner is... 
_Mr Diggory!

"Cedric and his friends cheer."
_DUMBLEDORE
_For showing unique command of the bubblehead 
 shark. The way I see it, Mr Potter would 
 have finished first had it not been 
 for his determination to rescue not 
 only Mr Weasly but the others as well. 
_We've agreed to award him second place! 
_For outstanding moral fibre.

 
"As they're walking away from the lake Harry's friends are cheering  him."

_FRED
_All that moral fibre eh?
_RON
_Blimey even when you go wrong it turns 
 out right.

_GEORGE
_Well done 'moral fibre'.
 
"Barty Crouch is waiting for Harry."
_BARTY
_Congratulations Potter, fine achievement. 
_Well done boy. I'm sorry we haven't 
 spoken, after all your story is one 
_I've heard many times. Quite remarkable. 
_Tragic of course, to lose one's family. 
_Never whole again are we? Still, life 
 goes on. And here we stand. I'm sure 
 your parents would be very proud today 
_Potter.

"Mad-Eye approaches them."
_MAD-EYE
_Bartimus! Not trying to lure Potter 
 into one of the ministry's summer internships 
 are we? Last boy who went into the department 
 of ministries never came out!

"Barty walks away from him."
_MAD-EYE
_And they say I'm mad.
 
"EXT. DARK FOREST"
_HAGRID
_So I remember, I remember when I first 
 met you all. Biggest bunch of misfits 
_I've ever set eyes on. Always reminded 
 me of myself a little. And here we all 
 are, four years later.

_RON
_We're still misfits.
_HAGRID
_Maybe. But we've all got each other, 
 and Harry of course. Soon to be! The 
 youngest! Tri-Wizard champion there's 
 ever been! Hooray!

"They walk on singing the Hogwarts song. Harry holds his head  in pain. On the ground he sees Barty Crouch laying lifeless."

 
_HARRY
_Mr Crouch?
 
"INT. HOGWARTS DARK ROOM"
_DUMBLEDORE
_A man has died here. And he won't be 
 the last, you must take action.

_FUDGE
_I will not. In times like these the 
 wizard world looks to its leaders for 
 strength Dumbledore.

_DUMBLEDORE
_Then for once show them some.
_FUDGE
_The tri-wizard tournament will not be 
 cancelled. I will not be seen as a coward.

 
_DUMBLEDORE
_But surely that is what's right, no 
 matter what others think.

_FUDGE
_What did you say? What did you say to 
 me?

_MAD-EYE
_Excuse me gentlemen, it may interest 
 you to know that this conversation is 
 no longer private.

"Mad-Eye points to the door. Harry enters."
_FUDGE
_Harry! Harry how good to see you again.

 
_HARRY
_I can come back later Professor.
_DUMBLEDORE
_Oh not necessary Harry the minister 
 and I are done. I'll be back in a moment. 
_Minister, after you. Harry do feel free 
 to indulge in a liquorice snack in my 
 absence, but I have to warn you they're 
 a little bit sharp.

"Harry is left alone in the room. He puts his hand in the snackbowl  and takes a handful. It turns into a small creature which nips  at his hand."

_HARRY
_Agh!
"A compartment in the wall opens, there's a glowing blue pool  of water there. He looks in. He falls and lands in another time  and place. It's a courtroom, the walls have a red glow. Dumbledore  is seated next to where Harry is."

 
"INT. COURTROOM"
_HARRY
_Professor?
"The man seated next to Dumbledore speaks."
_MAN
_Professor.
"Dumbledore and the man shake hands. Their handshake goes through  Harry's body, he appears to be some kind of ghost with no presence.  Proceedings begin, a cage is raised from inside the floor."

 
_BARTY
_Igor Karkaroff, you have been brought 
 from Azkaban at your own request to 
 present evidence to this counsel. Should 
 your testimony prove consequential. 
_Counsel may be prepared to order your 
 immediate release. Until such time you 
 remain in the eyes of the ministry a 
 convicted deatheater. Do you accept 
 these terms?

_IGOR
_I do sir.
_BARTY
_What do you wish to present?
_IGOR
_I have names sir. There was a Rosier, 
_Evan Rosier.

_BARTY
_Mr Rosier is dead.
_IGOR
_Dead? 
_MAD-EYE
(To Dumbledore) Yeah took a piece of 
 me with him though didn't he.

"Mad-Eye points to his mechanical eye."
_IGOR
_I didn't know.
_BARTY
_If that is all the witness has to offer...

 
_IGOR
_No! No! There was Rookwood, he was a 
 spy.

_BARTY
_Augustus Rookwood? Of the department 
 of ministries.

_IGOR
_Ya ya, the same. He passed information 
 to you know who from inside the ministry 
 itself.

_BARTY
_Very well. Counsel will deliberate. 
_In the meantime you will be returned 
 to Azkaban.

_IGOR
_NO! WAIT! PLEASE! I have more. Snape, 
_Severus Snape.

_DUMBLEDORE
_The counsel is very much aware you have 
 given evidence on this matter. Severus 
_Snape was indeed a deatheater and prior 
 to Lord Voldemort's downfall turned 
 spy for us at great personal risk. Today 
 he's no more a deatheater than I am.

 
"Igor protests loudly."
_IGOR
_It's a lie! Severus Snape remains faithful 
 to the dark lord.

_BARTY
_Silence!
"Barty hits the gavel repeatedly."
_BARTY
_Unless the witness possesses any name 
 of genuine consequence this session 
 is now concluded.

_IGOR
_Oh no no no no no. I heard about one 
 more.

_BARTY
_What's that?
_IGOR
_The name...
_BARTY
_Yes?
_IGOR
_I know for a fact this person took part 
 in the capture, and by means of the 
 cruciatus curse, torture of the aurer 
_Frank Longbottom and...

_BARTY
_The name! Give me the wretched name!

 
_IGOR
_Barty Crouch! ... Junior.
"Barty Crouch junior begins to run. Mad-Eye zaps him with magic,  he falls into the center of the court. The crowd is in uproar.  Guards seize Barty junior."

_BARTY JR
_Get your hands off me you pathetic little 
 men. Hello father.

_BARTY
_You are no son of mine.
_BARTY JR
_GAHHHH!
"Harry steps out of the blue pool and we're back in the darkened  room."

_DUMBLEDORE
_Curiosity's not a sin Harry, but you 
 should exercise caution. It's a pensieve, 
 useful if like me you find your mind 
 a wee bit stretched. It allows me to 
 see what small things I've already seen. 
_You see Harry I've searched and searched 
 for something, some small detail. Something 
_I might have overlooked, something that 
 would explain why these terrible things 
 have happened. Every time I get close 
 to an answer it slips away, it's maddedning.

 
_HARRY
_Sir, Mr Crouch's son, what happened 
 to him?

_DUMBLEDORE
_He was sent to Azkaban. Destroyed Barty 
 to do it. But he had no choice, the 
 evidence was overwhelming. Why do you 
 ask?

_HARRY
_It's just that I had a dream about him. 
_It was in the summer, before school. 
_In the dream I was in a house and Voldemort 
 was there only he wasn't quite human, 
 and Wormtail was there too and Mr Crouch's 
 son.

_DUMBLEDORE
_Have there been other dreams like this?

 
_HARRY
_Yes. Always the same one. Sir... these 
 dreams, what I see, you don't think 
 it's actually happening do you?

_DUMBLEDORE
_I think it's unwise for you to linger 
 over these dreams Harry, I think it's 
 best that you simply...

"Dumbledore puts up his wand and pulls a quivering string of magic  out from his head."

_DUMBLEDORE
_Cast them away.
 
"INT. CORRIDOR Harry is walking along, we hear raised voices from inside the  herbs store."

_IGOR
_It's a sign Severus, you know what it 
 means as well as I.

"The door opens and they see Harry. He looks at them. Igor leaves."

 
_SEVERUS
_Potter! What's your hurry? Congratulations, 
 your performance in the black lake was 
 inspiring. Gilliweed, am I correct?

 
_HARRY
_Yes sir.
_SEVERUS
_Ingenious. A rather rare herb gilliweed, 
 not something found in your every day 
 garden. Nor is this, know what it is?

 
_HARRY
_Bubble juice sir?
_SEVERUS
_Veritaserum. Three drops of this and 
 you-know-who himself will spill his 
 darkest secrets. The use of this on 
 a student is regrettably forbidden, 
 however should you ever steal from my 
 personal stores again, my hand might 
 just slip over your morning pumpkin 
 juice. 

_HARRY
_I haven't stolen anything.
_SEVERUS
_Don't lie to me. Gilliweed might be 
 innocuous, but boomslang skin? lacewing 
 flies? You and your friends are brewing 
 polyjuice potion and believe me I'm 
 going to find out why.

"Severus closes the door in Harry's face."
 
"EXT. ARENA Music is playing and a large crowd is gathered. The champions  emerge."

_DUMBLEDORE
_Earlier today Professor Moody placed 
 the tri-wizards cup deep within the 
 maze. Only he knows its exact position. 
_Now as Mr Diggory...

"The crowd cheer on hearing his name."
_DUMBLEDORE
(continued) and Mr Potter tied for first 
 position they will be the first to enter 
 the maze. Followed by Mr Krum...

"The bulgarian crowd go nuts."
_DUMBLEDORE
(continued) The first person to touch 
 the cup will be the winner. I've instructed 
 the staff to patrol the perimeter, if 
 at any point should a contestant wish 
 to withdraw from the task he or she 
 need only send up red sparks with their 
 wands. Contestants, gather round.

 
_DUMBLEDORE
(To the contestants) In the maze you'll 
 find not dragons or creatures of the 
 deep. Instead you'll face something 
 more challenging. You see, people change 
 in the maze. Oh find the cup if you 
 can, but be very weary you could just 
 lose yourselves along the way.

_MAD-EYE
_Champions! Prepare yourselves.
"Cedric hugs his father."
_DUMBLEDORE
_On the count of three... ONE...
"The cannon goes off. Mr Filch shrugs comically. Dumbledore groans.  Harry and Cedric enter the maze through different entrances.  The entrance closes up behind Harry. Heavy mist sets in, we pan  out to see the maze is many stories tall. Harry starts traversing  the maze, creature noises are all around."

"Cedric is walking along, the maze walls begin to close in on  him. He makes a run for it. Fleur is running around scared, she  is attacked and knocked down. Viktor comes along and sees she's  unconscious on the ground, he walks on. Harry sees Fleur being  swallowed into the undergrowth."

_HARRY
_Fleur? Fleur!
"He's too late she's disappeared. He sends up a red spark into  the air. A heavy wind starts blowing, walls are closing in, Harry  runs. Harry sees something shining in the distance and he moves  towards it Viktor tries to zap him but misses."

_CEDRIC
_Get down!
"Harry ducks and Viktor gets zapped by Cedric. Cedric runs up  and kicks the wand out of Viktor's hand. He points his wand at  Viktor's body as if to finish him off, Harry runs up and intervenes."

 
_HARRY
_No stop! He's bewitched Cedric.
"They struggle."
_CEDRIC
_Get off me!
_HARRY
_He's bewitched!
"The two of them begin running towards the cup. The undergrowth  grabs Cedric and he falls to the ground. Harry looks back. Cedric  is pinned down with no means of escape."

_CEDRIC
_Harry! Harry!
"Harry zaps the plantlife and Cedric wriggles free. Harry helps  him up."

_CEDRIC
_You know for a moment there I thought 
 you were gonna let it get me.

_HARRY
_For a moment so did I.
_CEDRIC
_Some game huh?
_HARRY
_Some game.
"The wind starts blowing again."
_CEDRIC
_Go. Take it, you saved me!
_HARRY
_Together, on three. One, two, three!

 
 
"EXT. GRAVEYARD Harry and Cedric have ported to a graveyard. "
_CEDRIC
_You ok?
_HARRY
_Yeah, you?
_CEDRIC
_Where are we?
_HARRY
_I've been here before.
_CEDRIC
_It's a portkey. Harry the cup is a portkey.

 
_HARRY
_I've been here before in a dream. Cedric, 
 we have to get back to the cup? Now!

 
_CEDRIC
_What are you talking about?
"Harry lets out a shout and holds his head, he is in pain."
_CEDRIC
_What is it?
_HARRY
_Get back to the cup!
"We see Wormtail and Voldemort nearby. "
_CEDRIC
_Who are you? What do you want?
_VOLDEMORT
_Kill the spare.
"Wormtail casts a spell and kills Cedric."
_HARRY
_Cedric!
"Cedric lays dead on the ground. Wormtail pulls Harry closer, a status grabs hold of Harry and  traps him."

_VOLDEMORT
_Do it, now!
"Wormtail drops something into a cauldron, Harry watches on. "

 
_WORMTAIL
_Bones of the father, unwillingly given. 
 

"A bone hovers in the air under Wormtail's control, he drops it  into the cauldron."

_WORMTAIL
_Flesh of the servent willingly sacrificed. 
 

"He takes a knife and slashes his arm over the cauldron."
_WORMTAIL
_Blood of the enemy forcibly taken.

 
"He takes the knife to Harry and cuts at his arm. Harry shouts.  Wormtail takes the knife over to the cauldron and lets the drops  fall into it."

_WORMTAIL
_The dark lord shall rise again. 
"The cauldron bursts into flame and a reformed Voldemort emerges."

 
_VOLDEMORT
_My wand Wormtail.
"Wormtail hands him the wand and bows deeply."
_VOLDEMORT
_Hold out your arm.
_WORMTAIL
_Master. Thank you master.
_VOLDEMORT
_The other arm Wormtail.
"Wormtail looks concerned, but does it anyway. Voldemort sticks  the wand into Wormtail's arm. The sky changes, others have been  summoned."

_VOLDEMORT
_Welcome my friends. Thirty years it's 
 been, and yet you stand before me as 
 though it were only yesterday. I confess 
 myself disappointed, not one of you 
 tried to find me. 

"Voldemort begins slashing angrily at the hooded figures. "
_VOLDEMORT
_Not even you, Lucius. 
_LUCIUS
_My lord. Had I detected any sign or 
 even a whisper of your whereabouts.

 
_VOLDEMORT
_There were signs my friend, and more 
 than whispers. 

_LUCIUS
_I assure you I never renounced the old 
 ways. The face I have been obliged to 
 present each day since your absence, 
 that was my true mask.

_WORMTAIL
_I returned.
_VOLDEMORT
_Out of fear, not loyalty. Still you 
 have proved yourself useful these past 
 few months Wormtail.

"Voldemort grants Wormtail a new hand."
_WORMTAIL
_Thank you master, thank you.
_VOLDEMORT
(To Cedric's corpse) Oh, such a handsome 
 boy. 

_HARRY
_Don't touch him.
"Harry struggles to get free."
_VOLDEMORT
_Harry! I'd almost forgotten you were 
 here. Standing on the bones of my father. 
_I'd introduce you but word has it you're 
 almost as famous as me these days. The 
 boy who lived. How lies have fed your 
 legend Harry. Shall I reveal what really 
 happened that night thirteen years ago? 
_Shall I divulge how I truly lost my 
 powers? It was love. You see when dear 
 sweet Lily Potter gave her life for 
 her only son she provided the ultimate 
 protection. I could not touch you. It 
 was old magic, something I should have 
 forseen. But no matter, no matter. Things 
 have changed, I can touch you now!

 
"Voldemort puts his hand on Harry's head and he screams."
_VOLDEMORT
_Astonishing what a few drops of your 
 blood will do eh Harry? Pick up your 
 wand Potter. I said pick it up, get 
 up. Get up! You've been taught how to 
 duel I presume yes? First we bow to 
 each other. Come on now Harry the niceties 
 must be observed, Dumbledore would not 
 want you to forget your manners now 
 would he? I said bow!

"Voldemort forces Harry to bow with magic."
_VOLDEMORT
_That's better. And now...
"Voldemort casts at Harry and he wriggles in pain."
_VOLDEMORT
_Atta boy Harry, your parents would be 
 proud. Especially your filthy mongrel 
 mother. I'm going to kill you Harry 
_Potter, I'm going to destroy you. After 
 tonight no one will ever again question 
 my powers. After tonight if they speak 
 of you they'll speak only of how you 
 begged for death, and I being a merciful 
 lord obliged. Get up.

"Voldemort pulls Harry to his feet, Harry begins to move away."

 
_VOLDEMORT
_Don't you turn your back on me Harry 
_Potter I want you to look at me when 
_I kill you, I want to see the lights 
 leave your eyes.

"Harry takes steps toward Voldemort."
_HARRY
_Have it your way.
"They both cast and their streams of magic meet. They both struggle."

 
_VOLDEMORT
_Do nothing. He is mine to finish. He's 
 mine!

"Shapes form in the surrounding magical energy. We hear Dumbledore's  voice."

_HARRY'S DAD
(voice) Harry when the connection is 
 broken you must get to the portkey. 
_We can delay it for a moment to give 
 you time but only a moment, do you understand?

 
_CEDRIC
(voice) Harry take my body back will 
 you? Take my body back to my father.

 
_HARRY'S MOTHER
(voice) Let go. Sweetheart you're ready. 
_Let go! Let go!

"The connection breaks, Harry runs over to Cedric's body and summons  the cup over to them. In an instant the port out. Voldemort looks  angry."

_VOLDEMORT
_No!
 
"EXT. ARENA Back at the arena Harry appears with Cedric's body. The crowd  don't understand what has taken place and they all cheer, triumphant  music starts to play. Harry weeps on Cedric's body. "

_DUMBLEDORE
_Harry! Harry!
"Dumbledore tries to prize Harry from Cedric's body."
_DUMBLEDORE
_Tell me what happened!
_HARRY
_He's back, he's back! Voldemort's back. 
_Cedric, he asked me to bring his body 
 back. I couldn't leave him, not there.

 
_DUMBLEDORE
_It's alright Harry. It's alright, he's 
 home, you both are.

_FUDGE
_Keep everybody in their seats. A boy 
 has just been killed. The body must 
 be moved Dumbledore, there are... too 
 many people.

_AMOS
_Let me through! That's my son! My boy!

 
"Amos breaks down wailing. The crowd look on distraught."
 
"INT. DARKENED ROOM Mad-Eye Moody enters and closes the door behind him. Harry is  in the room still sobbing. They sit. "

_MAD-EYE
_Are you alright Potter?
"Harry nods."
_MAD-EYE
_Does it hurt?
_HARRY
_Not so much now.
_MAD-EYE
_I'd better take a look at it.
"We see Harry's arm, it has a skull and snake marking."
_HARRY
_The cup was a portkey. Someone had bewitched 
 it.

_MAD-EYE
_What was it like? What was he like?

 
_HARRY
_Who?
_MAD-EYE
_The dark lord. What was it like to stand 
 in his presence?

_HARRY
_I dunno. It was like I'd fallen into 
 one of my dreams. One of my nightmares. 
 

"Mad-Eye starts shaking and struggling for air, he reaches for  his bottle but it's empty. He rushes to a chest with other bottles  and struggles to find one."

_MAD-EYE
_Were there others? In the graveyard, 
 were there others?

_HARRY
_Um. I don't think I said anything about 
 a graveyard Professor.

_MAD-EYE
_Marvellous creatures dragons aren't 
 they? Do you think that miserable oaf 
 would have led you into the woods if 
_I hadn't suggested it? Do you think 
_Cedric Diggory would have told you to 
 hold the egg under the water if I hadn't 
 have told him first myself? Do you think 
_Neville Longbottom the witless wonder 
 could have provided you with gilliweed 
 if I hadn't have given him the book 
 that led you straight to it? Huh??

 
_HARRY
_It was you from the beginning. You put 
 my name in the goblet of fire. You bewitched 
_Krum. But...

"Mad-Eye makes sobbing noises making fun of Harry."
_MAD-EYE
_You won because I made it so Potter. 
_You ended up in that graveyard tonight 
 because it was meant to be so. And now 
 the deed is done. The blood that runs 
 through these veins runs within the 
 dark lord. Imagine how he will reward 
 me when he learns that I have once and 
 for all silenced the great Harry Potter.

 
"A flash of magic occurs and Mad-Eye is knocked into the wall.  Dumbledore and Severus come rushing in. Dumbledore takes Mad-Eye  by the neck..."

_DUMBLEDORE
_Severus...
"Severus administers some veritaserum. Mad-Eye wriggles demonically."

 
_DUMBLEDORE
_Do you know who I am?
_MAD-EYE
_Albus Dumbledore.
_DUMBLEDORE
_Are you Alastor Moody? Are ya?
_MAD-EYE
_No.
_DUMBLEDORE
_Is he in this room? Is he in this room?

 
"We see a nod."
_DUMBLEDORE
_Harry get away from there!
"Dumbledore approaches the chest. The chest opens, it contains  a series of smaller chests. When the final chest is open we see  that there's a pit within holding a man the real Alastor Moody."

 
_DUMBLEDORE
_Are you alright Alastor?
_ALASTOR
_I'm sorry Albus.
_HARRY
_That's Moody, but then who's...?
"Dumbledore holds up one of Mad-Eye's Bottles."
_SEVERUS
_Polyjuice potion.
_DUMBLEDORE
_Now we know who's been stealing it from 
 your store Severus.

"Dumbledore looks into the pit."
_DUMBLEDORE
_We'll get you up in a minute.
"Alastor Moody groans. The Mad-Eye Moody they have captive in  a chair begins to twitch about restlessly making strange noises.  He appears to be transforming. He rips off his fake eyepiece  which falls on the floor, we see that he's transformed into Barty  Crouch Junior."

_DUMBLEDORE
_Barty Crouch Junior.
_BARTY JR
_I'll show you mine if you show me yours.

 
"Barty Jr rolls up his sleeve to reveal a skull and snake marking."

 
_DUMBLEDORE
_Your arm Harry.
_BARTY JR
_You know what this means don't you? 
_He's back. Lord Voldemort has returned.

 
_DUMBLEDORE
_Send an owl to Azkaban, think they'll 
 find they're missing a prisoner. 

 
_BARTY JR
_I'll be welcomed back like a hero.

 
_DUMBLEDORE
_Perhaps. Personally I've never had much 
 time for heroes.

 
"INT. ASSEMBLY ROOM"
_DUMBLEDORE
(Speaking to all pupils) Today we acknowledge 
 a really terrible loss. Cedric Diggory 
 was as you all know, exceptionally hard 
 working, intricately fair minded. And 
 most importantly a fierce fierce friend. 
_I think therefore you have the right 
 to know exactly how he died. You see, 
_Cedric Diggory was murdered by Lord 
_Voldemort. The ministry of magic does 
 not wish me to tell you this. But not 
 to do so I think would be an insult 
 to his memory. Now the pain we all feel 
 at this dreadful loss reminds me, reminds 
 us that while we may come from different 
 places and speak in different tongues, 
 our hearts beat as one. In light of 
 recent events the bonds of friendship 
 we made this year will be more important 
 than ever. Remember that and Cedric 
_Diggory will not have died in vain, 
 you remember that. And we'll celebrate 
 a boy who was kind and honest and brave 
 and true right to the very end.

 
"INT. BEDROOM Harry is sitting on a bed, Dumbledore walks in."
_DUMBLEDORE
_I never liked these curtains. Set them 
 on fire in my fourth year, by accident 
 of course. I put you in terrible danger 
 this year Harry I'm sorry.

_HARRY
_Professor, when I was in the graveyard 
 there was a moment... um... when Voldemort's 
 wand and mine sort of connected.

_DUMBLEDORE
_Priorium Contatum. You saw your parents 
 that night didn't you? They reappeared.

 
"Harry nods."
_DUMBLEDORE
_No spell can reawaken the dead Harry 
_I trust you know that. Dark and diffiult 
 times lie ahead. Soon we must all face 
 the choice between what is right what 
 is easy. But remember this, you have 
 friends here. You're not alone.

 
"EXT. HOGWARTS There's a large crowd gathered, the pupils are going home. Viktor  Krum gives Hermione a kiss and hands her some paper."

_VIKTOR
_Write to me. Promise.
_HERMIONE
_Bye.
"Ron is sitting alone. The french sisters approach him, they both  in turn give him a kiss on the head."

_FLEUR
_Au revoir Ron.
"The Beauxbatons girls leave in uniform, the crowd applauds. The  Durmstrang boys leave too, shaking hands as they go."

_RON
_Do you think we'll ever just have a 
 quiet year at Hogwarts?

_HERMIONE
_No.
_HARRY
_No I don't think so.
_HERMIONE
_Everything's going to change now isn't 
 it?

_HARRY
_Yes.
_HERMIONE
_Promise you'll write this summer. Both 
 of you.

_RON
_Well I won't. You know I won't!
_HERMIONE
_Harry will won't you?
_HARRY
_Yeah. Every week.
"They look over the balcony, the flying horses pulling a carriage  head off into the distance. The Bulgarians' ship goes underwater."

 
 
"FADE OUT."
