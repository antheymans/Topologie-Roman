_OLD MAN
"Bloody kids."
He leaves the house and heads towards the light.
EXT. DARKNES he old man is wandering up to the house carrying a lit torch. e opens the front door, inside is just as dark. He begins climbing he stairs, we hear whispers and hushed voices coming from upstairs. he old man waits outside the room where the conversation is aking place and listens on.
_WORMTAIL
"Oh no no no my Lord Voldemort. I only  meant... perhaps if we were to do it  without the boy.."
_VOLDEMORT
"NO! The boy is everything, it cannot  be done without him and it WILL be done  exactly as I say."
_UNKNOWN MAN
"I will not disappoint you my lord."

_VOLDEMORT
"Good. First, gather our old comrades.  Send them a sign."
A snake slithers past the old man and into the room. 
_VOLDEMORT
"Nagini tells me the old caretaker is  standing outside the door."
Wormtail stands in the doorway and looks at the old man. The ld man looks terrified.
_VOLDEMORT
"Step aside so I can give our guest a  proper greeting."
A loud spell is cast and Harry wakes up in a flash of panic.

INT. BEDROOM
_HERMIONE
"Harry!"
Harry is flustered and still panicing.
_HERMIONE
"Are you alright?"
_HARRY
"Hermione. Bad dream. When did you get  here?"
_HERMIONE
"Just now. You?"
_HARRY
"Last night."
Hermione goes over to Ron's bed.
_HERMIONE
"Wake up. Wake up Ronald!"
_RON
"Bloody hell."
_HERMIONE
"Honestly. Get dressed, and don't go  back to sleep. Come on Ron! Your mother  says breakfast's ready."

EXT. GRASSLAND
_HARRY
"Where are we actually going?"
_RON
"Don't know. Hey Dad! Where are we going?"

_ARTHUR
"Haven't the foggiest, keep up!"
_AMOS
"Arthur! It's about time son."
_ARTHUR
"Sorry Amos. Some of us had a bit of  a sleepy start. This is Amos Diggory  everyone, he works with me at the ministry.  And this strapping young lad must be  Cedric, am I right?"
_CEDRIC
"Yes sir. "
_AMOS
"Merlin's beard, you must be Harry Potter."

_HARRY
"Yes sir. This way."
_AMOS
"Great great pleasure."
They shake hands.
_HARRY
"Pleasure to meet you too sir."
They walk on up the hill.
_ARTHUR
"That's it sir, just over there."
_AMOS
"Shall we? We don't want to be late."

Camera homes in on a boot on top of the hillside.
_HARRY
"Why are they all standing around that  manky old boot?"
_FRED
"That isn't just any old manky boot mate."

_GEORGE
"It's a portkey."
Everyone is in a circle putting their hands on the boot.
_AMOS
"Time to go. Ready?"
_HARRY
"What's a 'portkey'?"
_AMOS
"After"
One... Two...
_ARTHUR
"Harry!"
Harry rushes over and puts his hand on the boot.
_AMOS
"Three!"
There's a white flash and suddenly they're all flying through he air. Everyone cheers. 
_ARTHUR
"Let go kids!"
_HERMIONE
"What??"
_ARTHUR
"Let! Go!"
Harry, Hermione and the young Weasleys crash to the ground with  thump. Arthur, Amos and Cedric come down more gracefully.

_ARTHUR
"I bet that cleared your sinuses eh?"

Cedric helps Harry to his feet.
_HARRY
"Thanks."
They walk across the field and we see there's a massive crowd athered and cheering, tents are set up all over.
_ARTHUR
"Well kids, welcome to the Quidditch  World Cup!"
They walk into the crowd, taking in the sights. Music is playing nd people fly about overhead on brooms. They approach a small ent.
_AMOS
"Parting of the waves I think old chap,  see you at the match."
Amos and Cedric separate and walk off.
_HARRY
"See ya later Cedric."
_ARTHUR
"Home sweet home."
INT. TEN hey enter the tent, the inside is many times bigger than the utside.
_ARTHUR
"Girls. Choose a bunk and unpack. Ron,  get out of the kitchen we're all hungry."

_TWINS
"Yeah get out of the kitchen Ron."
_ARTHUR
"Feet off the table."
_TWINS
"Feet off the table."
They take their feet off the table and put them back on as soon s Arthur has walked past.
_HARRY
(Smiling) I love magic.
EXT. HILLSID e pan up the hillside onto a large stadium which seems to have  huge number of floors.
INT. STADIU he Weasleys and Harry are finding their seats.
_RON
"Blimey Dad, how far up ARE we?"
Lucius Malfoy and Draco are walking below them.
_LUCIUS
"Well put it this way, if it rains...  you'll be the first to know"
_DRACO
"Father and I are in the minister's box,  by personal invitation of Cornelius  Fudge himself."
_LUCIUS
"Don't boast Draco. There's no need with  these people. Do enjoy yourself won't  you. While you can."
The ceremonies begin. Balloons fly and fireworks go off.
_ARTHUR
"Come on up, take your seats. I told  you these seats would be worth waiting  for."
_GEORGE
"Come on!"
_FRED
"It's the Irish!"
Five green and white figures fly through the air on their brooms eaving a colored trail behind them. A glittering leprechaun ppears in the sky and starts dancing. Everyone is excited.

_GEORGE
"Here come the Bulgarians!"
Five red figures this time, one of them performs a stunt on his room. One of them appears on the large screen. The crowd begins o chant 'Krum, Krum, Krum'. 
_WEASLEYS
"Krum!!!"
_GEORGE
"Yes!"
Viktor Krum waves to the crowd.
_ANNOUNCER
"Good evening! It gives me great pleasure  to welcome each and every one of you  to the final of the 422nd Quidditch  World Cup. Let the match begin!"

INT. TENT
_RON
"There's no one like Krum. He's like  a bird the way he rides the wind. He's  more than an athlete, he's an artist."

The twins are bumbling about in a comical way muttering 'KRUMMMM'.

_GINNY
"Think you're in love Ron?"
_TWINS
(Singing) Viktor I love you! Viktor 
"I do!"
Harry joins in.
_BOYS
"When we're apart my heart beats only  for youuu!"
_FRED
"Sounds like the irish have got their  pride on."
_ARTHUR
"Stop! Stop it. It's not the irish. We've  gotta get out of here. Now."

EXT. OUTSIDE THE TENT
_ARTHUR
"Get back to the portkey everybody, and  stick together. Fred, George... Ginny  is your responsibility."
Some figures in pointed hoods carrying flaming torches are walking cross the campsite chanting ominous noises. The crowd is paniced nd rushing all over. Harry is trampled unconscious.

EXT. OUTSIDE - TIME PASSE he crowds have all gone. A man walks through the rubble kicking t things. He casts a spell which causes a bright flash and a arge ghostly skull forms in the sky with a snake crawling from t. The man grins evilly, clearly demented. Harry stirs and witnesses he man standing there. Harry runs. The familiar voices of Ron nd Hermione are calling for him.
_RON
"Been looking for you for ages. Thought  we lost you."
_HARRY
"What is THAT?"
They look at the monstrous thing in the sky, Harry holds his ead in pain. Suddenly they are fired on. 
_ARTHUR
"Stop! That's my son."
Arthur and others approach.
_ARTHUR
"Ron, Harry, Hermione are you alright?"

_BARTY
"Which of you conjured this?"
_ARTHUR
"You can't possibly.."
_BARTY
"Do not lie! You have been discovered  at the scene of the crime!"
_HARRY
"Crime?"
_ARTHUR
"Barty, they're just kids."
_HARRY
"What crime?"
_HERMIONE
"Harry it's his mark."
_HARRY
"Those people tonight, in the masks...  they're his too aren't they? they're  his followers. "
_BARTY
"Follow me."
_HARRY
"There was a man. Before. There."
_BARTY
"All of you, this way."
_ARTHUR
"Harry, who?"
_HARRY
"I dunno. I didn't see his face."
INT. TRAIN CARRIAG arry, Ron and Hermione are seated on a train. A voice calls ut.
_LADY OFFSCREEN
"Anything from the trolley? Anything  from the trolley?"
The lady appears at their door.
_LADY
"Anything from the trolley dears?"
_RON
"Packet of drewbals and a liquorice wand."

Ron sees he hasn't enough money.
_RON
"On second thought, just the drewbals."

_HARRY
"It's alright I'll get it."
_RON
"Just the drewbals, thanks."
Cho Chan walks up to the trolley.
_CHO
"Two pumpkin pasties please."
Harry and Cho look at each other and smile.
_CHO
"Thank you."
_LADY
"Anything sweet for you dear?"
_HARRY
"Oh no thank you I'm not hungry."
_HERMIONE
"This is horrible, how can the ministry  not know who conjured it. Isn't there  any security or?"
_RON
"Loads according to Dad, that's what  worried them so much. Happened right  under their noses."
Hermione sees Harry rubbing his head.
_HERMIONE
"It's hurting again isn't it, your scar."

_HARRY
"I'm fine."
_HERMIONE
"You know Sirius will want to hear about  this. What you saw at the world cup,  and the dream."
Harry has written a letter, he marks Sirius Black on an envelope nd gives it to an owl.

EXT. HOGWART e see four flying horses flying through the air pulling a carriage oming in to land at Hogwarts. The crowds cheer.
_HAGRID
"Clear the runway."
_HARRY
"Well there's something you don't see  every day."
A large ship emerges from under the water and approaches too.

_DUMBLEDORE
"Now we're all settled in and sorted,  I'd like to make an announcement. This  castle will not only be your home this  year but home to some very special guests  as well. You see Hogwarts has been choosen..."

A man runs up the aisle limping in a comical way, he whispers omething to Dumbledore and leaves in the same fashion.
_DUMBLEDORE
"So Hogwarts has been choosen to host  a legendary event. The Tri-Wizard tournament.  Now for those of you who do not know,  the tri-wizard tournament brings together  three schools for a series of magical  contests. From each school a single  contestant is selected to compete. Now  let me be clear, if choosen you stand  alone. And trust me when I say these  contests are not for the faint hearted,  but more of that later. For now please  join me in welcoming the lovely ladies  of the Beauxbatons Academy of magic  and their headmistress Madam Maxime."

A group of girls dressed in blue dance up the aisle and release utterflies into the air. They bow and everyone applauds.
_STUDENT
"Blimey, that's one big woman."
_DUMBLEDORE
"And now our friends from the north,  please greet the proud sons of Durmstrang  and the high master Igor Karkaroff."

A series of older boys walk up the aisle brandishing bo staffs, wirling them around and periodically stabbing them into the round with a spark effect.
_RON
"Blimey it's him, Viktor Krum!"
The boys breathe some fire.
_IGOR
"Albus!"
_DUMBLEDORE
"Igor."
They embrace.
EXT. HOGWARTS - STORMY - NIGHT
_MADAME MAXIME
"Professor Dumbledore, my horses have  travelled a long way. They will need  attending to."
_DUMBLEDORE
"Not to worry Madame Maxime, our gamekeeper  Hagrid's more than capable of seeing  to them."
_MADAME MAXIME
"But you know Monsieur Hagrid, they drink  only single malt whiskey."
The man seated next to Hagrid yelps. Hagrid has stabbed a fork nto his hand.
_MAN
"You idiot!"
INT. ASSEMBLY ROOM
_DUMBLEDORE
"Your attention please! I would like  to say a few words. Eternal glory, that  is what awaits the student who wins  the tri-wizard tournament. But to do  this that student must survive three  tasks. Three extremely dangerous tasks."

_FRED
"Wicked."
_DUMBLEDORE
"For this reason the ministry has seen  fit to impose a new rule. To explain  all this we have the head of the department  of international magic cooperation Mister  Bartimus Crouch."
Thunder roars overhead, rain begins leaking through the roof nd screams break out. A strange man stands in the doorway, he asts some magic upwards and seals the roof. Peace is restored.

_RON
"Bloody hell, it's Mad-Eye Moody."
_HERMIONE
"Alastor Moody? The aura."
_RON
"He was a catcher. Half the cells in  Azkaban are full thanks to him. He's  supposed to be mad as a hatter though  these days."
This character enters the room and begins walking. We see Harry hrough his mechanical eye. He limps, breathing heavily as he oes.
_DUMBLEDORE
"My dear old friend, thanks for coming."

_MAD-EYE
"That stupid roof."
Mad-Eye takes a drink.
_PUPIL
"What's that he's drinking do you suppose?"

_HARRY
"I don't know but I don't think it's  Pumpkin Juice."
_BARTY
"After much deliberation the ministry  has concluded that for their own safety  no student under the age of seventeen  shall be allowed to put forth their  name for the tri-wizard tournament.  This decision is final."
The crowd is unsettled, people are booing.
_GEORGE
"That's rubbish! You don't know what  you're doing!"
_DUMBLEDORE
"Silence! "
Dumbledore casts magic over a box which melds into a goblet containing  blue flame.
_DUMBLEDORE
"The goblet of fire. Anyone wishing to  submit themselves for the tournament  merely write their name upon a piece  of parchment and throw it in the flame  before this hour on Thursday night.  Do not do so lightly, if choosen there's  no turning back. As from this moment  the tri-wizard tournament has begun."

INT. ASSEMBLY ROOM - NIGH e see a suspicious character enter the room where the goblet s still burning and close the door behind him.

INT. CLASSROOM
_MAD-EYE
"Alastor Moody."
He writes his name on the board.
_MAD-EYE
"Ministry malcontent. And your new defence  against the dark arts teacher. I'm here  because Dumbledore asked me, end of  story, goodbye, the end. Any questions?  When it comes to the dark arts, I believe  in a practical approach. But first,  which of you can tell me how many unforgivable  curses there are?"
_HERMIONE
"Three sir."
_MAD-EYE
"And they are so named?"
_HERMIONE
"Because they are unforgivable. Use of  any one of them will..."
_MAD-EYE
"Will earn you a one way ticket to Azkaban.  Correct. Now the ministry says you're  too young to see what these curses do.  I say different! You need to know what  you're up against, you need to be prepared,  you need to find somewhere else to put  your chewing gum other than the underside  of your desk Mr Finnigan!"
_PUPIL
"Aw no way, the old codger can see out  the back of his head."
Mad-Eye throws the chalk in anger.
_MAD-EYE
"So, which curse shall we see first?  WEASLEY!"
_RON
"Yes..."
_MAD-EYE
"Give us a curse."
_RON
"Well, my dad did tell me about one...  The imperious curse."
_MAD-EYE
"Ahhh yes, your father would know all  about that. Gave the ministry quite  a bit of grief a few years ago. Perhaps  this will show you why."
Mad-Eye pops open a jar with a spider in it.
_MAD-EYE
"Hello. What a little beauty. "
He uses his wand to send it around the class.
_MAD-EYE
"Don't worry. Completely harmless."
The class is unsettled.
_MAD-EYE
"But if she bites... she's lethal!"
Draco laughs.
_MAD-EYE
"What are you laughing at?"
Mad-Eye sends the spider onto Draco's face.
_MAD-EYE
"Talented isn't she? What shall I have  her do next? Jump out the window? Drown  herself?"
Mad-Eye has the spider over a bucket of water, it's wriggling.

_MAD-EYE
"Scores of witches and wizards have claimed  that they only do did you-know-whose  bidding under the influence of the imperious  curse. But here's the rub, how do we  sort out the liars? Another.. another..  Come on come on. Longbottom is it? Up."

Neville Longbottom stands.
_MAD-EYE
"Professor Sprout tells me you have an  aptitude for herbology."
_NEVILLE
"There's the um... The cruciatus curse."

_MAD-EYE
"Correct! Correct! come come. Particularly  nasty. The torture curse."
Mad-Eye begins torturing the spider with magic, it squeals.

_HERMIONE
"Stop it! Can't you see it's bothering  him, stop it!"
Mad-Eye stops. Neville is disturbed. Mad-Eye picks up the spider hich is still making a noise.
_MAD-EYE
"Perhaps you could give us the last unforgivable  curse Miss Granger."
Hermione shakes her head. He casts a spell and the spider disintegrates.

_MAD-EYE
"The killing curse. Only one person is  known to have survived it. And he's  sitting in this room."
He approaches Harry's desk and takes a drink.
INT. STAIRS
_RON
"Brilliant isn't he! Completely demented  of course. Terrifying to be in the same  room with, he's really BEEN there you  know."
_HERMIONE
"There's a reason those curses are unforgivable,  and to perform them in a classroom.  I mean did you see Neville's face."

They see a boy on the stairs facing the window.
_HERMIONE
"Neville?"
Mad-Eye approaches Neville and pats him on the shoulder.
_MAD-EYE
"Son. You alright?"
Neville nods.
_MAD-EYE
"Come on, we'll have a cup of tea. I  want to show you something."

INT. GOBLET ROO lder students are placing their names into the flame and others re applauding, Cedric is one of them.
_RON
"Eternal glory, be brilliant wouldn't  it? In three years from now we'll be  old enough to be choosen."
_HARRY
"Yeah well rather you than me."
The twins come up cheering.
_GEORGE
"Thank you thank you, well lads we've  done it."
_FRED
"Cooked it up just this morning. "
_HERMIONE
"It's not going to work."
_FRED
"Oh yeah? And why's that Granger."
_HERMIONE
"You see this? This is an age line. Dumbledore  drew it himself."
_FRED
"So?"
_HERMIONE
"So a genius like Dumbledore couldn't  possibly be fooled by something pathetically  dimwitted such as an age potion."
_GEORGE
"That's why it's so brilliant."
_GEORGE
"Ready Fred?"
_FRED
"Ready George?"
They jump inside the age line, and cheer. They put their names n the flame and do a high-five. The flame fires up and they're lung across the room onto the floor. When they get up they have ull heads of grey hair and beards.
_GEORGE
"You said.."
Fred You said. hey roll around fighting on the floor and the crowd cheer. The oom suddenly becomes silent as Viktor Krum walks in and puts is name in the flame. He looks at Hermione and she smiles.

INT. GOBLET ROOM - THURSDAY NIGHT
_DUMBLEDORE
"Sit down please. And now the moment  you've all been waiting for, the champions  selection! "
Dumbledore approaches the blue flame and it glows red. A name omes out. Everyone looks on anxiously.
_DUMBLEDORE
"The Durmstrang champion is ... Viktor  Krum!"
The Durmstrang crowd cheer. Another name comes out.
_DUMBLEDORE
"The champion from Beauxbatons... Fleur  Delacour"
The Beauxbatons girls cheer as Fleur walks up. Another name comes ut.
_DUMBLEDORE
"The Hogwarts champion... Cedric Diggory."

Hogwarts pupils cheer as Cedric takes the stage.
_DUMBLEDORE
"Excellent! we now have our three champions!  But in the end only one will go down  in history. Only one will hoist this  chalice of champions, this vessel of  victory the tri-wizard cup!"
People cheer, but the goblet glows red once more and another ame flies out. Dumbledore takes it and reads...
_DUMBLEDORE
"Harry Potter. Harry Potter? "
_HAGRID
"No... No."
_DUMBLEDORE
"Harry Potter!"
_HERMIONE
"Go on Harry. Harry for goodness sake."

Harry slowly walks up. Dumbledore gives him the paper. Voices n the crowd shout out.
_VOICE
"He's a cheat! He's not even seventeen  yet."

INT. ROO arry is in a room with the other champions. Dumbledore bursts n and grabs Harry.
_DUMBLEDORE
"Harry! Did you put your name in the  goblet of fire?"
_HARRY
"No sir."
_DUMBLEDORE
"Did you ask one of the older students  to do it for you?"
_HARRY
"No sir."
_DUMBLEDORE
"You're absolutely sure?"
_HARRY
"Yes sir."
_MADAME MAXIME
"Well of course he is lying."
_MAD-EYE
"The hell he is. The goblet of fire is  an exceptionally powerful magical object,  only an exceptionally powerful conjurer  could have hoodwinked it. Magic way  beyond the talents of a fourth year."

_IGOR
"You seem to have given this a fair bit  of thought Mad-Eye."
_MAD-EYE
"It was once my job to think as dark  wizards do Karkaroff perhaps you remember?"

_DUMBLEDORE
"That doesn't help Alastor. Leave this  to you Barty."
_BARTY
"The rules are absolute, the goblet of  fire constitutes a binding magical contract.  Mr Potter has no choice, he is as of  tonight... a tri-wizards champion."

INT. DARKENED TOWER ROOM
_MCGONAGALL
"This can't go on Albus. First the dark  mark, now this?"
_DUMBLEDORE
"What do you suggest Minerva?"
_MCGONAGALL
"Put an end to it. Don't let Potter compete."

_DUMBLEDORE
"You heard Barty the rules are clear."

_MCGONAGALL
"Well the devil with Barty and his rules.  And since when did you accomodate them..."

_SEVERUS
"Master I too find it difficult to believe  this mere coincidence, if we are to  truly discover the meaning of these  events perhaps we should for the time  being let them unfold."
_MCGONAGALL
"Do nothing?? Offer him up as bait? Potter  is a boy not a piece of meat."
_DUMBLEDORE
"I agree with Severus. Alastor, keep  an eye on Harry will you?"
_MAD-EYE
"I can do that."
_DUMBLEDORE
"Don't let him know though, he must be  anxious enough as it is... knowing what  lies ahead. Then again, we all are."

INT. BEDROOM
_RON
"How did you do it?"
Harry is silent.
_RON
"Never mind. Doesn't matter. You could  have let your best friend know though."

_HARRY
"Let you know what?"
_RON
"You know bloody well what."
_HARRY
"I didn't ask for this to happen Ron.  Okay? You're being stupid."
_RON
"Yeah that's me, Ron Weasley... Harry  Potter's stupid friend."
_HARRY
"I didn't put my name in that cup. I  don't WANT eternal glory I just wanna  be.. Look, I don't know what happened  tonight and I don't know why, it just  did ok."
_RON
"Piss off."
INT. HOGWART  woman appears in a puff of smoke. She's well groomed and dressed olorfully.
_RITA
"What a charismatic quartet. Hello!"

The four tri-wizard champions are stood together in a group. he walks over to them and shakes each of their hands.
_RITA
"I'm Rita Skeeter, I write for the daily  prophet. But of course you know that  don't you. It's you we don't know, you're  the news. What quirks lurk beneath those  rosy cheeks? what mysteries do the muscles  mask? does courage lie beneath those  curls? In short, what makes a champion  tick. Me, myself and I want to know.  Not to mention my rabid readers. So,  who's feeling up to sharing? Mmm? Shall  we start with the youngest. Lovely."

She takes Harry by the hand into a closet.
_RITA
"This is cosy."
_HARRY
"It's a broomcupboard."
_RITA
"You should feel right at home then.  Don't mind if I use the quill do you?"

_HARRY
"Oh, no."
_RITA
"So Harry, here you sit, a mere boy of  twelve.."
_HARRY
"I'm fourteen."
_RITA
 ...about to compete against three students. 
"Not only vastly more emotionally mature  than yourself but have mastered spells  that you wouldn't attempt in your dizziest  daydreams. Concerned?"
_HARRY
"I dunno I haven't really thought about  it."
_RITA
"Course you're not just any ordinary  boy of twelve are you..."
_HARRY
"Fourteen."
_RITA
"The story's legend. Do you think it  was the trauma of your past that made  you so keen to enter such a dangerous  tournament."
_HARRY
"No I didn't enter."
_RITA
"Course you didn't. Everyone loves a  rebel Harry. (to the quill) Scratch  that last. Speaking of your parents,  were they alive, how do you think they'd  feel? proud? or concerned that your  attitude shows at best a pathological  need for attention, at worst a psychotic  deathwish."
_HARRY
(looking at the notepad) Hey, my eyes 
"aren't glistening with the ghosts of  my past. "

INT. ROOFTO n owl flies in with a letter for Harry, he takes it and begins o read.
_SIR
(VOICEOVER) Harry. I couldn't risk sending 
"Edward. It was since the world cup and  the ministry's been intercepting more  and more owls and she's too easily recognised.  We need to talk Harry. Face to face.  Meet me in the Griffindore common room  at one o clock this Saturday night and  make sure you're alone. P.S...."
The owl nips Harry's finger.
_HARRY
"AGH!"
_SIR
(VOICEOVER CONT'D) The bird bites.

INT. GRIFFINDORE COMMON ROOM
_HARRY
"Sirius?"
Harry picks up a newspaper, the headline reads "THE CHAMPIONS RE SELECTED" and reads.
_RITA
(VOICEOVER) Harry Potter aged 2, suspect 
"entrant in the tri-wizard tournament.  His eyes swimming with the ghosts of  his..."
Her voice becomes desperate as he crumples up the newspaper and uts it on the fire. The fire flares up a little, a face appears n it.
_HARRY
"Sirius?! How..."
_SIR
"I don't have much time Harry so let  me get straight to it. Did you or did  you not put your name into the goblet  of fire?"
_HARRY
"No!"
_SIR
"Shh... I had to ask. Now, tell me about  this dream of yours. You mentioned Wormtail  and Voldemort, but who was the third  man in the room?"
_HARRY
"I dunno."
_SIR
"You didn't hear a name?"
_HARRY
"No. Umm.. Voldemort was giving him a  job to do. Something important."
_SIR
"What was that?"
_HARRY
"He wanted... me. I dunno why, but he  was gonna use this man to get to me.  I mean it was only a dream right?"

_SIR
"Yes. It's just a dream. Look Harry,  the deatheaters at the world cup, your  name rising from that goblet these are  not just coincidences. Hogwarts isn't  safe any more."
_HARRY
"What are you saying?"
_SIR
"I'm saying the devils are inside the  walls. Igor Karkaroff, he was a deatheater.  And no one, no one stops being a deatheater.  Then there's Barty Crouch, heart of  stone, sent his OWN son to Azkaban."

_HARRY
"Do you think one of them put my name  in the goblet?"
_SIR
"I haven't a clue who put your name in  that goblet Harry but whoever did it  is no friend to you. People die in this  tournament."
_HARRY
"I'm not ready for this Sirius."
_SIR
"You don't have a choice."
_HARRY
"Someone's coming!"
_SIR
"Keep your friends close Harry."
Ron enters the room.
_RON
"Who you talking to?"
_HARRY
"Who says I was talking to anyone."
_RON
"I heard voices. "
_HARRY
"Maybe you're imagining things, wouldn't  be the first time."
_RON
"You're probably just practicing for  your next interview I expect."
Ron leaves. Harry goes to the fire again but Sirius is gone. he newspaper in the fire has the headline "TEENAGE TRAGEDY".

EXT. LAKESIDE
_NEVILLE
"Amazing. Amazing."
_HARRY
"Neville! You're doing it again!"
_NEVILLE
"Oh, right sorry."
_HARRY
(reading a book) Magical water plants 
"of the highland Lochs?"
_NEVILLE
"Moody gave it to me. That day we had  tea."
Neville waves. Hermione and Ron are walking up to them.
_HERMIONE
(Whispering to Ron) We've already been 
"through enough people why don't you  just go and do it yourself? Ughh. What  do you want me to say again?"
Ron whispers some words to Hermione. It's clear Ron and Harry re not on speaking terms.
Hermione walks up to Harry.
_HERMIONE
"Ronald would like me to tell you that  Seamus told him that Dean was told by  Parvati that Hagrid was looking for  you."
_HARRY
"Is that right? Well.... what?"
_HERMIONE
"Uhhh..."
She walks back to Ron for more whispering and comes back.
_HERMIONE
"Dean was told by Parvati that... Please  don't ask me say it again. Hagrid's  looking for you."
_HARRY
"Well you can tell Ronald..."
_HERMIONE
"I'm NOT an owl!"
INT. FORES arry and Hagrid are walking through a dark forest.
_HAGRID
"Did you bring your father's cloak like  I asked you?"
_HARRY
"Yeah I brought the cloak. Hagrid where  are we going?"
_HAGRID
"You'll see soon enough. Pay attention  this is important."
_HARRY
"What's with the flower? Hagrid have  you combed your hair?"
Hagrid is looking more dapper than usual and is carrying a big ed flower.
_HAGRID
"As a matter of fact I have. You might  like to try the same thing now and again."

We hear animal noises. Madame Maxime calls out to Hagrid.
_MADAME MAXIME
"Hagrid?"
_HAGRID
"Oh, the cloak. Put the cloak on."
Harry does as he's told.
_HAGRID
"Bonsoir Olympe."
_MADAME MAXIME
"Oh Hagrid. I thought you weren't coming,  I thought perhaps... you had... forgotten  me."
_HAGRID
"Couldn't forget you Olympe."
_MADAME MAXIME
"What is it you want to show me? When  we spoke earlier you sounded so exhilirated."

_HAGRID
"You'll be glad you came. Trust me."

A dragon nearby gives a loud roar.
_MADAME MAXIME
"Ahh, c'est magnifique!"
In an opening we see people are running about, dragons are roaring nd breathing fire.
_MADAME MAXIME
"Can we get closer?"
_HARRY
"Dragons? That's the first task? You're  joking."
_HAGRID
"Come on Harry. They're seriously misunderstood  creatures. "
A huge flame fires up.
_HAGRID
"Although, I have to admit that horntail  is a right nasty piece of work. Poor  Ron nearly fainted just seeing him you  know."
_HARRY
"Ron was here?"
_HAGRID
"Oh sure. His brother Charlie helped  bring him over from Romania. Didn't  Ron tell you that?"
_HARRY
"No he didn't. He didn't tell me a thing."

EXT. HOGWARTS - DAYTIM e're zoomed in on a badge, it depicts Cedric on a bright yellow ackground. Then the badge spins and shows Harry on a green background ith the words "Potter Stinks" on it. As Harry walks along other upils aim insults at him saying he stinks. A young boy runs ast.
_BOY
"Cedric rules!"
_HARRY
"Thanks."
Harry gets to a doorway, two pupils stand in his way.
_BOY
"Like the badge?"
_HARRY
"Excuse me.."
They laugh, Harry pushes his way through. He approaches Cedric ho is standing around with his friends. Cedric's friends hurl ff more insults.
_HARRY
(to Cedric) Can I have a word?
_CEDRIC
"Alright."
They walk away some distance.
_HARRY
"Dragons. That's the first task. They've  got one for each of us."
_CEDRIC
"Are you serious? And Fleur and Krum,  do they...?"
_HARRY
"Yes."
_CEDRIC
"Right. Hey listen, about the badges.  I've asked them not to wear them."

_HARRY
"Don't worry about it."
Ron and Seamus are walking along. Harry approaches them.
_HARRY
(To Ron) You're a right foul git you 
"know that?"
_RON
"You think so?"
_HARRY
"I know so."
_RON
"Anything else?"
_HARRY
"Yeah. Stay away from me."
_RON
"Fine."
Draco calls out, he's sitting up a tree.
_DRACO
"Why so tense Potter? My father and I  have a bet you see. I don't think you're  gonna last ten minutes in this tournament.  He disagrees. He thinks you won't last  FIVE."
_HARRY
"I don't give a damn what you or your  father thinks Malfoy. He's vile and  cruel, and you're just pathetic."
Harry walks away and Draco angrily tries casting a spell. Mad-Eye ppears and quickly turns Malfoy into a ferret.
_MAD-EYE
"I'll teach you to cast when someone's  back is turned."
_MCGONAGALL
"Professor Moody what are you doing?"

_MAD-EYE
"Teaching."
_MCGONAGALL
"Is that a student?"
_MAD-EYE
"Technically it's a ferret."
Mad-Eye is making the ferret hover around. He sends it up the rouser leg of one of Draco's friends. He squirms and looks uncomfortable. veryone else is laughing. Mad-Eye winks to Harry and he laughs. ventually it comes back out and McGonagall turns Draco back o normal.
_DRACO
"My father will hear about this!"
_MAD-EYE
"Is that a threat! "
Draco runs away. Mad-Eye shouts after him.
_MAD-EYE
"I could tell you stories about your  father that would curl even your greasy  hair boy! It doesn't end here!"
_MCGONAGALL
"We never use transfigration as a punishment,  surely Dumbledore told you that."
_MAD-EYE
"He might've mentioned it."
_MCGONAGALL
"Well you will do well to remember it."

_MAD-EYE
(To Harry) come with me.
INT. MAD-EYE'S ROO ad-Eye takes off his prosthetic leg and takes a seat.
_MAD-EYE
"That's a foal glass. Lets me keep an  eye on my enemies. If I can see the  whites of their eyes they're standing  right behind me."
A noise emerges from a trunk on the floor and it shakes.
_MAD-EYE
"Wouldn't even bother telling you what's  in ther. You wouldn't believe it if  I did. Now... what are you going to  do about your dragon?"
_HARRY
"Oh... um... You know I just thought  I'd..."
_MAD-EYE
"Sit. Listen to me Potter. Your pal Diggory,  by your age he could take a whistle  into a watch and have it sing you the  time. Miss Delacour, she's as much a  fairy princess as I am. As for Krum,  his head may be filled with sawdust  but Karkaroff's is NOT. They'll have  a strategy, and you can bet that it'll  play to Krum's strengths. Hmm? Come  on Potter. What are your strengths?"

_HARRY
"Um... I dunno.. I can fly. I mean I'm  a fair flyer."
_MAD-EYE
"Better than fair the way I heard it."

_HARRY
"But I'm not allowed a broom."
_MAD-EYE
"You're allowed a wand."
EXT. ARENA - TOURNAMENT STAGE he crowds are cheering, people are taking bets.
INT. WAITING TEN arry is pacing nervously. Hermione is standing by the tent door hispering in.
_HERMIONE
"Pssst! Harry? Is that you?"
_HARRY
"Yeah."
_HERMIONE
"How are you feeling? OK? The key is  to concentrate. After that you just  have to..."
_HARRY
"Battle a dragon."
Hermione enters the tent and they hug. A bright camera flashes, ita Skeeter the journalist approaches.
_RITA
"Young love! Ohh how.. stirring. If everything  goes unfortunately today you might make  the front page."
_VIKTOR
(To Rita) You have no business here. 
"This tent is for champions and friends."

_RITA
"No matter. We've got what we wanted."

Rita leaves and Dumbledore enters.
_DUMBLEDORE
"Good day champions. Gather round please.  Now you've waited, you've wondered and  at last the moment has arrived. The  moment only four of you can fully appreciate."

The champions gather around him in a circle.
_DUMBLEDORE
"What are you doing here Miss Granger?"

_HERMIONE
"Oh um.. Sorry I'll just go."
_DUMBLEDORE
"Barty. The bag."
_BARTY
"Champions, in a circle around me. Miss  Delacour over here, Mr Krum, and Potter  over here. Right. Miss Delacour, if  you will..."
Barty holds up a bag. Fleur takes out a little green dragon.

_BARTY
"The welsh green. Mr Krum..."
Viktor takes another out
_BARTY
"The chinese fireball. Oooooh."
Cedric picks one. 
_BARTY
"The swedish short-snout. Which leaves... "1
_HARRY
"The horntail..."
_BARTY
"What's that boy?"
_HARRY
"Nothing."
Harry puts his hand in the bag and pulls out the dragon.
_BARTY
"The hungarian horntail. These represent  very real dragons, each of which has  been given a golden egg to protect.  Your objective is simple, collect the  egg. This you must do, for each egg  contains a clue without which you cannot  hope to proceed to the next task. Any  questions?"
_DUMBLEDORE
"Very well. Good luck champions. Mr Diggory  the sound of the cannon..."
The cannon fires immediately ranscribed by IMSDb.com
INT. TENT arry is sitting alone nervously.
_DUMBLEDORE
(VOICEOVER THE LOUDSPEAKER) Three of 
"our champions have now faced their dragons  and so each one of them will proceed  to the next task. And now our fourth  and final contestant."
Harry enters the rocky arena. The crowd are cheering his name. e sees the golden egg sitting alone, he makes a run for it but he dragon appears. Harry's forced to retreat behind a rock as he dragon flames him. Harry stumbles and falls around the arena.

_HERMIONE
"Your wand harry! Your wand!"
Harry summons a broom. He jumps on and flies off, the dragon ives chase. The dragon bursts through the crowd and they look tunned.

EXT. HOGWARTS SK arry is flying at high speed around the Hogwarts buildings. he dragon cuts him off and whips him off his broom, he lands n the roof of Hogwarts, hanging on for dear life. The dragon s clambering across the roof, strewing tiles as it goes. Harry eaches his broom but it's stuck. He jerks it loose and lets o of the roof just in time before the dragon swipes at him. e falls a long way but regains control. He flies on to an area ith a bridge, he flies through a gap in the bridge but the dragon rashes into it and falls into the water.

INT. AREN he crowds are mostly silent. We see Harry flying towards us nd the crowd erupts. He goes straight for the golden egg.

INT. HOGWART arry is lifting the golden egg, people around him cheering. he Weasly twins have Harry sitting on their shoulders.
_GEORGE
"We knew you wouldn't die Harry."
_FRED
"Lose a leg."
_GEORGE
"Or an arm."
_FRED
"Pack it in altogether."
_TWINS
"NEVER!"
_SEAMUS
"Go on Harry, what's the clue?"
Seamus hands Harry the golden egg.
_HARRY
"Who wants me to open it? You want me  to open it?"
He opens the egg and a loud horrific screech comes out, he closes t again.
_HARRY
"What the bloody hell was that?"
Ron appears in the doorway.
_FRED
"Alright everyone, go back to your knitting.  This is gonna be uncomfortable enough  without all you nosey sods listening  in."
_RON
"I reckon you'd have to be barking mad  to put your own name in the goblet of  fire."
_HARRY
"Caught on have you. Took you long enough."

_RON
"Wasn't just me who thought you'd done  it. Everyone was saying it behind your  back."
_HARRY
"Brilliant. That makes me feel loads  better."
_RON
"At least I warned you about the dragons."

_HARRY
"Hagrid warned me about the dragons."

_RON
"Oh no no, I did. Don't you remember?  I told Hermione to tell you that Seamus  told me that Parvati told Dean that  Hagrid was looking for you. Seamus never  actually told me anything, so it was  really me all along. I thought you'd  be alright, you know, after you figured  that out."
_HARRY
"Who could possibly figure that out?  That's completely mental."
_RON
"Yeah it is isn't it. Suppose I was a  bit distraught."
_HERMIONE
"Boys."
INT. CLASSROO arry is looking at Cho. When she looks back he spills drink rom his mouth. They laugh at him.
_HERMIONE
(Reading a newspaper) Look at this! 
"I can't believe it she's done it again.  Miss Granger a plain but ambitious girl  seems to be developing a taste for famous  wizards. Her latest prey sources report  is none other than the Bulgarian bon-bon  Viktor Krum. No word yet on how Harry  Potter's taking this latest emotional  blow."
A young boy walks up holding a package.
_NIGEL
"Parcel for you Mr Weasley."
_RON
"Thank you Nigel. "
Nigel is gazing at Harry.
_RON
"Not now Nigel. Later. Go on."
Nigel leaves.
_RON
"I told him I'd get him Harry's autograph.  Oh look mum's sent me something. Mum  sent me a dress??"
_HARRY
"Well it does match your eyes. Is there  a bonnet?"
_RON
"Ginny these must be for you."
_GINNY
"I'm not wearing that it's ghastly."

Hermione laughs.
_RON
"What are you on about?"
_HERMIONE
"They're not for Ginny they're for you!  Dress robes."
_RON
"Dress robes? for what?"
INT. ASSEMBLY ROOM
_MCGONAGALL
"The yule ball has been a tradition of  the tri-wizard tournament since its  inception. On Christmas eve night we  and our guests gather in the great hall  for well mannered frivolity. As representitives  of the host school I expect each and  every one of you to put your best foot  forward, and I mean this literally because  the yule ball is first and foremost...  a dance. "
Groans emerge from the boys who are listening on. The girls seem  lot more excited.
_MCGONAGALL
"Silence. The house of Godrick Griffindore  has commanded the respect of the wizard  world for nearly ten centuries. I will  not have you in the course of a single  evening besmirching that name by behaving  like a babbling, bumbling band of baboons."

_FRED
(Whispering to George) Try saying that 
"five times faster."
They try.
_MCGONAGALL
(Continued) Now to dance is to let the 
"body breathe, inside every girl a secret  swan slumbers longing to burst forth  and take flight."
_RON
(Whispering to Seamus) Something's about 
"to burst out of Hilary but I don't think  it's a swan."
_MCGONAGALL
"Inside every boy a lordly lion prepared  to prance. Mr Weasly, will you join  me."
She grabs Ron and pulls him up to dance. 
_MCGONAGALL
"Now, place your right hand on my waist."

_RON
"Where?"
_MCGONAGALL
"My waist. "
He does so and a wolf whistle comes from the crowd.
_MCGONAGALL
"Now bend your arm. Mr Filch..."
The music starts.
_MCGONAGALL
"One two three, one two three, one two  three."
_HARRY
(To the Weasly twins) Oi! Never gonna 
"let him forget this are you?"
_TWINS
"Never."
_MCGONAGALL
"Everybody come together."
The girls instantly stand and walk forward, the boys are all till seated.
_MCGONAGALL
"Boys, on your feet."
Neville stands.
EXT. HOGWARTS - DAYTIME
_HARRY
"Why do they always have to travel in  packs? How are you supposed to get one  alone to ask them..."
_RON
"Blimey Harry, you slayed dragons. If  you can't get a date who can?"
_HARRY
"I think I'd take the dragon right now."

Groups of girls are giving them icy looks and turning their backs.

INT. HOGWART agrid and Madame Maxime are walking together.
_HAGRID
"I take after my mum. Though I didn't  know her very well, she left when I  was about three. No, not the maternal  sort her, broke my dad's heart though.  You know he was a tiny little fellow  my dad, I could pick him up with one  hand by the age of six and put him up  in the dresser."
They laugh together and have a moment.
_HAGRID
"And then he died when I was still in  school. So I had to make me own way  as it were. But enough of me, what about  you!"

EXT. LAKESID iktor Krum is training, a group of girls are following him around.

INT. CLASSROOM
_RON
"This is mad. At this rate we'll be the  only ones in our year without dates."

Severus Snape walks past and slaps Ron over the head. 
_RON
"Well, us and Neville!"
_HARRY
"But then again he can take himself."

_HERMIONE
"It might interest you to know that Neville's  already got someone."
Ron gasps.
_RON
"Now I'm really depressed."
Fred hands Ron a note, it reads "GET A MOVE ON OR ALL THE GOOD NES WILL HAVE GONE!".
_RON
"Well Hermione, you're a girl."
_HERMIONE
"Oh well spotted."
_RON
"Come on. It's one thing for a bloke  to show up alone. For a girl it's just  sad."
_HERMIONE
"I won't be going alone because believe  it or not someone's asked me. And I  said yes."
_RON
"Bloody hell."
Hermione storms off.
_RON
"Look. We've just got to grit our teeth  and do it. Tonight when we get back  to the common room, we'll both have  partners. Agreed?"
_HARRY
"Agreed."
EXT. HOGWARTS - SNOW arry is walking up some steps. He reaches the top and bumps nto Cho who has come around the corner.
_CHO
"Harry!"
_HARRY
"Cho!"
_CHO
"Watch yourself on the stairs, it's a  bit icey at the top."
_HARRY
"Ok thanks. Cho?"
_CHO
"Yes?"
_HARRY
"Um. (Mumbling) I just wondered if maybe  you wanted to go to the ball with me?"

_CHO
"Sorry? I didn't catch that."
_HARRY
"Um. I was just wondering if maybe you  wanted to go to the ball with me."

_CHO
"Oh. Um. Harry I'm sorry but someone's  already asked me. And well I've said  I'll go with him."
_HARRY
"Ok. Great. Fine. No problem. Good."

_CHO
"Harry I really am sorry."
INT. COMMON ROO on is being helped into the room, he looks shaky.
_HARRY
"What happened to you?"
_GIRL
"He just asked Fleur Delacour out."
_HERMIONE
"What?"
_HARRY
"What did she say?"
_HERMIONE
"No of course."
Ron shakes his head. 
_HERMIONE
"She said yes??"
_HARRY
"Don't be silly."
_RON
"There she was walking by. You know I  like it when they walk. I couldn't help  it, it just sort of slipped out."
_GIRL
"Actually he sort of screamed at her,  it was a bit frightening."
_HARRY
"What did you do then?"
_RON
"What else? I ran for it. I'm not cut  out for this Harry. I don't know what  got into me."
The Patil twins walk past.
_PATILS
"Hi Harry."
_HARRY
"Hey!"
INT. DANCEHAL oft music plays and everyone is well dressed, gathered in the all. 

ELSEWHER on is getting dressed in front of a mirror. He looks paniced nd uncomfortable in his ridiculous dress robes.
_RON
"Bloody hell."
Harry walks in, he's dressed in a more conventional suit.
_RON
"What are those??"
_HARRY
"My dress robes."
_RON
"Well they're alright. No lace, no dodgy  little collar. "
_HARRY
"Well I expect yours are more traditional."

_RON
"Traditional?? They're ancient! I look  like my great aunt Tessie."
He sniffs at his clothes.
_RON
"I smell like my great aunt Tessie. Murder  me Harry."

INT. DANCEHAL arry and Ron are walking down the stairs into the hall. Ron s fidgeting with his outfit.
_HARRY
"Leave it alone."
_RON
"Poor kid, bet she's alone in her room  crying her eyes out."
_HARRY
"Who?"
_RON
"Hermione of course. Come on Harry, why'd  you think she wouldn't tell us who she's  coming with?"
_HARRY
"Because we'd take the mickey out of  her if she did."
_RON
"Because nobody asked her. I would have  taken her myself if she weren't so bleeding  proud."
The boys approach the Patil twins.
_PARVATI
"Hello boys. Don't you look..."
She looks at Ron.
_PARVATI
 ... dashing.
_MCGONAGALL
"Here you are Potter. Are you and Miss  Patil ready?"
_HARRY
"Ready professor?"
_MCGONAGALL
"To dance. It's traditional that the  three champions or in this case four  are the first to dance. Surely I told  you that."
_HARRY
"No."
_MCGONAGALL
"Oh well now you know. Oh, as for your  Mr Weasly you may proceed into the great  hall with Miss Patil."
Hermione enters the room all dressed up.
_PARVATI
"She looks beautiful."
_HARRY
"Yeah she does."
Hermione walks down the stairs. Viktor Krum takes her hand and hey walk together.
_PADMA
(To Ron) Is that Hermione Granger? With 
"Viktor Krum??"
_RON
"No. Absolutely not."
Loud music plays as the champions head to the dancefloor with heir partners.
_PARVATI
"Harry. Take my waist."
_HARRY
"What?"
_PARVATI
"Now."
They dance. Soon others are joining in, Dumbledore and McGonagall, r Filch and his cat, Hagrid and Madame Maxime. Mad-Eye sits n the sidelines drinking. The scene changes, the music is now ock played by the Weird Sisters fronted by Jarvis Cocker from ulp. Cool!. The crowd is jumping. Harry, Ron and their dates re sitting some distance away looking miserable. Hermione comes p after a great time with Viktor.
_HERMIONE
"Hot isn't it? Viktor's gone to get drinks.  Care to join us?"
_RON
"No, we'd NOT care to join you and Viktor."

_HERMIONE
"What's got your wand in a knot?"
_RON
"He's a Durmstrang. You're fraternising  with the enemy."
_HERMIONE
"The enemy?? Who was it wanting his autograph?  Besides, the whole point of the tournament  is international magical cooperation,  to make friends."
_RON
"Hrmph, I think he's got a bit more than  friendship on his mind."
Hermione walks off.
_PADMA
"Are you going to ask me to dance or  not?"
_RON
"No."
LATER
_RON
(To Hermione) He's using you.
_HERMIONE
"How dare you! Besides I can take care  of myself."
_RON
"Doubt it. He's way too old."
_HERMIONE
"What? What? That's what you think?"

_RON
"Yeah that is what I think."
_HERMIONE
"You know the solution then don't you."

_RON
"Go on."
_HERMIONE
"Next time there's a ball pluck up the  courage and ask me before somebody else  does, and not as a last resort."
_RON
"Well that's completely off the point.  Harry..."
Harry walks up.
_HERMIONE
"Where have you been? Nevermind! Off  to bed both of you."
Harry and Ron walk away.
_RON
"They get scary when they get older."

_HERMIONE
"Ron you spoil everything!"
INT. BEDROO IGHTMARE SEQUENC e're back in the old house. 
_VOLDERMORT
"Let me see it again."
A sleeve is rolled up and a marking of a skull and snake in on he arm.
_VOLDEMORT
"Ah yes, the time is close now. Harry!  At last! Step aside Wormtail so I can  give our guest a proper greeting!"

Harry wakes up. The floorboards are creaking, someone is walking p to his bed. It's Neville.
_NEVILLE
"You alright Harry? I just got in. Me!"

He chuckles and dances off.
EXT. A BRIDGE OUTSIDE HOGWARTS
_HERMIONE
"Harry you told me you'd figured the  egg out weeks ago. The task is two days  from now."
_HARRY
"Really? I had no idea. I suppose Viktor's  already figured it out."
_HERMIONE
"I wouldn't know, we didn't actually  talk about the tournament. Actually  we didn't really talk at all, Viktor's  more of a physical being. I just mean  he's not particularly... Mostly he watches  me study. It's a bit annoying actually.  You are trying to figure this egg out  aren't you?"
_HARRY
"What's that supposed to mean?"
_HERMIONE
"I mean these tasks are supposed to test  you, in the most brutal way they're  almost cruel. And um, I'm scared for  you. You got by the dragon mostly on  nerve, I'm not sure it's going to be  enough this time."
_CEDRIC
"Hey Potter. "
_HARRY
"Cedric."
_CEDRIC
"How are you?"
_HARRY
"Spectacular."
_CEDRIC
"Look I realise I never really thanked  you properly for tipping me off about  those dragons."
_HARRY
"Forget about it. I'm sure you would  have done the same for me."
_CEDRIC
"Exactly. You know the prefects bathroom  on the fifth floor?"
Harry nods.
_CEDRIC
"It's not a bad place for a bath. Just  take your egg and mull things over in  the hot water."

INT. BATHROO arry is taking his clothes off, he gets in the bath. He has is golden egg on the side.
_HARRY
"I must be out of my mind."
He opens the egg and the horrible screech noise comes out.
_MYRTLE
"I'd try putting it in the water if I  were you."
_HARRY
"Myrtle!"
_MYRTLE
"Long time no see."
The ghostly figure of little Myrtle flies around.
_MYRTLE
"I was circling a blocked drain the other  day and could swear I saw a bit of polyjuice  potion. Not being a bad boy again are  you Harry?"
_HARRY
"Polyjuice potion! Kicked the habit.  Myrtle, did you say try putting it in  the water?"
Myrtle flies around again and gets in the water.
_MYRTLE
"Well. That's what he did. The other  boy, the handsome one. Cedric."
Harry takes the egg and puts it under the water.
_MYRTLE
"Well go on, open it."
Harry does so and goes underwater himself. He hears a voice singing.

_VOICE SINGING
"Come seek us where our voices sound.  We cannot sing above the ground. An  hour long you'll have to look, to recover  what we took."
_HARRY
"Myrtle, there aren't Merpeople in the  black lake are there?"
_MYRTLE
"Ahhh, very good. Took Cedric ages to  riddle it out. Almost all the bubbles  were gone..."
Myrtle laughs and Harry is embarrassed.
INT. COMMON ROOM
_HERMIONE
"Harry, tell me again."
_HARRY
"Come seek us where our voices sound."

_HERMIONE
"The black lake, that's obvious."
_HARRY
"An hour long you'll have to look."
_HERMIONE
"Again obvious, though I must admit potentially  problematic "
_HARRY
"Potentially problematic? When was the  last time you held your breath under  the water for an hour Hermione?"
_HERMIONE
"Look Harry, we can do this. The three  of us can figure it out."
Mad-Eye Moody appears in the doorway.
_MAD-EYE
"Hate to break up this scholar session  but Professor McGonagall would like  to see you in her office. Not you Potter,  just Weasly and Granger."
_HERMIONE
"But sir, the second task is only hours  away and..."
_MAD-EYE
"Exactly. Presumably Potter is well prepared  by now and could do with a good night's  sleep. Go. Now! Longbottom!"
Neville appears from behind a bookcase.
_MAD-EYE
"Why don't you help Potter put his books  back."
_NEVILLE
"You know, if you're interested in plants  you'd be better with Gorshok's Guide  to Herbology. Do you know there's a  wizard in Nepal whose growing gravity  resistant trees?"
_HARRY
"Neville. No offense, but I really don't  care about plants. Now if there's a  Tibetan turnip that will allow me to  breathe underwater for an hour then  great."
_NEVILLE
"I don't know about a turnip but you  can always use gilliweed."

EXT. LAKESID he Weasly twins are shouting, busy taking bets. Harry is walking long with Neville, he has some green plantlife in his hand.

_HARRY
"You're sure about this Neville."
_NEVILLE
"Absolutely."
_HARRY
"For an hour."
_NEVILLE
"Most likely."
_HARRY
"Most likely?"
_NEVILLE
"Well there is some debate among herbologists  as to the effects of freshwater versus  saltwater."
_HARRY
"You're telling me this now? You must  be joking."
_NEVILLE
"I just wanted to help."
_HARRY
"Well that makes you sight better than  Ron and Hermione. Where are they anyway?"

_NEVILLE
"You seem a little tense Harry."
_HARRY
"Do I?"
_DUMBLEDORE
(Over a loudspeaker) Welcome to the 
"second task. Last night something was  stolen from each of our champions. A  treasure of sorts. These four treasures,  one for each champion, now lie on the  bottom of the black lake. In order to  win each champion need only find their  treasure and return to the surface.  Simple enough. Except for this, they  will have one hour to do so and one  hour only. After that they'll be on  their own."
_MAD-EYE
(To Harry) Put that in your mouth.

Harry puts the gilliweed in his mouth and starts choking.
_DUMBLEDORE
(Continued) You may begin at the start 
"of the cannon."
The cannon fires and the champions enter the water, three of hem dive in while Harry is pushed. Underwater the effects of illiweed take hold, Harry's hands and feet become webbed. 

EXT. ABOVE WATER
_SEAMUS
"What's the matter with him?"
_FRIEND
"I don't know I can't see him."
_NEVILLE
"Oh my god I've killed Harry Potter!"

Harry flies into the air like a dolphin and the crowd cheer.

EXT. UNDERWATE arry swims among the fish and rocks. Singing voices start echoing. e see Fleur get trapped, she screams. 

EXT. ABOVE WATER
_DUMBLEDORE
(Over the loudspeaker) The Beauxbatons 
"champion Miss Delacour has unfortunately  been forced to retire. She will take  no further part in this task. "

EXT. UNDERWATE arry is still searching around. He hears muffled screams. He inds Ron, Hermione, Cho Chan and a blonde girl from Beauxbatons ied in place by their ankles. Cedric is there, he takes Cho ith him. Harry sets about freeing Ron and Hermione but vicious erpeople appear.
_HARRY
"But she's my friend too!"
_MERPERSON
"Only one."
What looks like a shark approaches at high speed. We see that t has legs and it's Viktor. He takes Hermione and heads for he surface. Harry frees Ron. 

EXT. ABOVE WATE edric and Cho emerge, the crowd cheers. Viktor and Hermione ext, the crows chants 'Krum, Krum, Krum'. The Beauxbatons girls ook worried.

EXT. UNDERWATE arry looks over and sees the blonde girl that Fleur was unable o rescue. He loosens her rope too and starts heading for the urface with the both of them. He's attacked and gets held down, e pushes Ron and the girl towards the surface.

EXT. ABOVE WATE on and the girl come up, they are coughing but safe. They're elped out of the water by a girl from Beauxbatons. Underwater arry casts a spell which propels him towards the surface, he lies out and lands on the decking where the crowd are.
_DUMBLEDORE
"Harry! "
_BARTY
"Get him another towel."
_DUMBLEDORE
"I want all the judges over here now."

_FLEUR
(To Harry) You saved her, even though 
"she wasn't yours to save. My little  sister!"
Fleur kisses Harry on the face.
_FLEUR
"Thank you! And you... (Looks to Ron).  You helped!"
_RON
"Well... yeah... a bit"
Fleur kisses him too.
_RON
"Merci."
Hermione comes up to Harry with a towel.
_HERMIONE
"Harry!"
_HARRY
"Hermione"
_HERMIONE
"Are you alright? You must be freezing!  Personally I think you behaved admirably."

Hermione kisses Harry on the head.
_HARRY
"I finished last Hermione."
_HERMIONE
"Next to last."
_DUMBLEDORE
"Attention! Attention! The winner is...  Mr Diggory!"
Cedric and his friends cheer.
_DUMBLEDORE
"For showing unique command of the bubblehead  shark. The way I see it, Mr Potter would  have finished first had it not been  for his determination to rescue not  only Mr Weasly but the others as well.  We've agreed to award him second place!  For outstanding moral fibre."

As they're walking away from the lake Harry's friends are cheering im.
_FRED
"All that moral fibre eh?"
_RON
"Blimey even when you go wrong it turns  out right."
_GEORGE
"Well done 'moral fibre'."
Barty Crouch is waiting for Harry.
_BARTY
"Congratulations Potter, fine achievement.  Well done boy. I'm sorry we haven't  spoken, after all your story is one  I've heard many times. Quite remarkable.  Tragic of course, to lose one's family.  Never whole again are we? Still, life  goes on. And here we stand. I'm sure  your parents would be very proud today  Potter."
Mad-Eye approaches them.
_MAD-EYE
"Bartimus! Not trying to lure Potter  into one of the ministry's summer internships  are we? Last boy who went into the department  of ministries never came out!"
Barty walks away from him.
_MAD-EYE
"And they say I'm mad."
EXT. DARK FOREST
_HAGRID
"So I remember, I remember when I first  met you all. Biggest bunch of misfits  I've ever set eyes on. Always reminded  me of myself a little. And here we all  are, four years later."
_RON
"We're still misfits."
_HAGRID
"Maybe. But we've all got each other,  and Harry of course. Soon to be! The  youngest! Tri-Wizard champion there's  ever been! Hooray!"
They walk on singing the Hogwarts song. Harry holds his head n pain. On the ground he sees Barty Crouch laying lifeless.

_HARRY
"Mr Crouch?"
INT. HOGWARTS DARK ROOM
_DUMBLEDORE
"A man has died here. And he won't be  the last, you must take action."
_FUDGE
"I will not. In times like these the  wizard world looks to its leaders for  strength Dumbledore."
_DUMBLEDORE
"Then for once show them some."
_FUDGE
"The tri-wizard tournament will not be  cancelled. I will not be seen as a coward."

_DUMBLEDORE
"But surely that is what's right, no  matter what others think."
_FUDGE
"What did you say? What did you say to  me?"
_MAD-EYE
"Excuse me gentlemen, it may interest  you to know that this conversation is  no longer private."
Mad-Eye points to the door. Harry enters.
_FUDGE
"Harry! Harry how good to see you again."

_HARRY
"I can come back later Professor."
_DUMBLEDORE
"Oh not necessary Harry the minister  and I are done. I'll be back in a moment.  Minister, after you. Harry do feel free  to indulge in a liquorice snack in my  absence, but I have to warn you they're  a little bit sharp."
Harry is left alone in the room. He puts his hand in the snackbowl nd takes a handful. It turns into a small creature which nips t his hand.
_HARRY
"Agh!"
A compartment in the wall opens, there's a glowing blue pool f water there. He looks in. He falls and lands in another time nd place. It's a courtroom, the walls have a red glow. Dumbledore s seated next to where Harry is.

INT. COURTROOM
_HARRY
"Professor?"
The man seated next to Dumbledore speaks.
_MAN
"Professor."
Dumbledore and the man shake hands. Their handshake goes through arry's body, he appears to be some kind of ghost with no presence. roceedings begin, a cage is raised from inside the floor.

_BARTY
"Igor Karkaroff, you have been brought  from Azkaban at your own request to  present evidence to this counsel. Should  your testimony prove consequential.  Counsel may be prepared to order your  immediate release. Until such time you  remain in the eyes of the ministry a  convicted deatheater. Do you accept  these terms?"
_IGOR
"I do sir."
_BARTY
"What do you wish to present?"
_IGOR
"I have names sir. There was a Rosier,  Evan Rosier."
_BARTY
"Mr Rosier is dead."
_IGOR
"Dead? "
_MAD-EYE
(To Dumbledore) Yeah took a piece of 
"me with him though didn't he."
Mad-Eye points to his mechanical eye.
_IGOR
"I didn't know."
_BARTY
"If that is all the witness has to offer..."

_IGOR
"No! No! There was Rookwood, he was a  spy."
_BARTY
"Augustus Rookwood? Of the department  of ministries."
_IGOR
"Ya ya, the same. He passed information  to you know who from inside the ministry  itself."
_BARTY
"Very well. Counsel will deliberate.  In the meantime you will be returned  to Azkaban."
_IGOR
"NO! WAIT! PLEASE! I have more. Snape,  Severus Snape."
_DUMBLEDORE
"The counsel is very much aware you have  given evidence on this matter. Severus  Snape was indeed a deatheater and prior  to Lord Voldemort's downfall turned  spy for us at great personal risk. Today  he's no more a deatheater than I am."

Igor protests loudly.
_IGOR
"It's a lie! Severus Snape remains faithful  to the dark lord."
_BARTY
"Silence!"
Barty hits the gavel repeatedly.
_BARTY
"Unless the witness possesses any name  of genuine consequence this session  is now concluded."
_IGOR
"Oh no no no no no. I heard about one  more."
_BARTY
"What's that?"
_IGOR
"The name..."
_BARTY
"Yes?"
_IGOR
"I know for a fact this person took part  in the capture, and by means of the  cruciatus curse, torture of the aurer  Frank Longbottom and..."
_BARTY
"The name! Give me the wretched name!"

_IGOR
"Barty Crouch! ... Junior."
Barty Crouch junior begins to run. Mad-Eye zaps him with magic, e falls into the center of the court. The crowd is in uproar. uards seize Barty junior.
_BARTY JR
"Get your hands off me you pathetic little  men. Hello father."
_BARTY
"You are no son of mine."
_BARTY JR
"GAHHHH!"
Harry steps out of the blue pool and we're back in the darkened oom.
_DUMBLEDORE
"Curiosity's not a sin Harry, but you  should exercise caution. It's a pensieve,  useful if like me you find your mind  a wee bit stretched. It allows me to  see what small things I've already seen.  You see Harry I've searched and searched  for something, some small detail. Something  I might have overlooked, something that  would explain why these terrible things  have happened. Every time I get close  to an answer it slips away, it's maddedning."

_HARRY
"Sir, Mr Crouch's son, what happened  to him?"
_DUMBLEDORE
"He was sent to Azkaban. Destroyed Barty  to do it. But he had no choice, the  evidence was overwhelming. Why do you  ask?"
_HARRY
"It's just that I had a dream about him.  It was in the summer, before school.  In the dream I was in a house and Voldemort  was there only he wasn't quite human,  and Wormtail was there too and Mr Crouch's  son."
_DUMBLEDORE
"Have there been other dreams like this?"

_HARRY
"Yes. Always the same one. Sir... these  dreams, what I see, you don't think  it's actually happening do you?"
_DUMBLEDORE
"I think it's unwise for you to linger  over these dreams Harry, I think it's  best that you simply..."
Dumbledore puts up his wand and pulls a quivering string of magic ut from his head.
_DUMBLEDORE
"Cast them away."
INT. CORRIDO arry is walking along, we hear raised voices from inside the erbs store.
_IGOR
"It's a sign Severus, you know what it  means as well as I."
The door opens and they see Harry. He looks at them. Igor leaves.

_SEVERUS
"Potter! What's your hurry? Congratulations,  your performance in the black lake was  inspiring. Gilliweed, am I correct?"

_HARRY
"Yes sir."
_SEVERUS
"Ingenious. A rather rare herb gilliweed,  not something found in your every day  garden. Nor is this, know what it is?"

_HARRY
"Bubble juice sir?"
_SEVERUS
"Veritaserum. Three drops of this and  you-know-who himself will spill his  darkest secrets. The use of this on  a student is regrettably forbidden,  however should you ever steal from my  personal stores again, my hand might  just slip over your morning pumpkin  juice. "
_HARRY
"I haven't stolen anything."
_SEVERUS
"Don't lie to me. Gilliweed might be  innocuous, but boomslang skin? lacewing  flies? You and your friends are brewing  polyjuice potion and believe me I'm  going to find out why."
Severus closes the door in Harry's face.
EXT. AREN usic is playing and a large crowd is gathered. The champions merge.
_DUMBLEDORE
"Earlier today Professor Moody placed  the tri-wizards cup deep within the  maze. Only he knows its exact position.  Now as Mr Diggory..."
The crowd cheer on hearing his name.
_DUMBLEDORE
(continued) and Mr Potter tied for first 
"position they will be the first to enter  the maze. Followed by Mr Krum..."
The bulgarian crowd go nuts.
_DUMBLEDORE
(continued) The first person to touch 
"the cup will be the winner. I've instructed  the staff to patrol the perimeter, if  at any point should a contestant wish  to withdraw from the task he or she  need only send up red sparks with their  wands. Contestants, gather round."

_DUMBLEDORE
(To the contestants) In the maze you'll 
"find not dragons or creatures of the  deep. Instead you'll face something  more challenging. You see, people change  in the maze. Oh find the cup if you  can, but be very weary you could just  lose yourselves along the way."
_MAD-EYE
"Champions! Prepare yourselves."
Cedric hugs his father.
_DUMBLEDORE
"On the count of three... ONE..."
The cannon goes off. Mr Filch shrugs comically. Dumbledore groans. arry and Cedric enter the maze through different entrances. he entrance closes up behind Harry. Heavy mist sets in, we pan ut to see the maze is many stories tall. Harry starts traversing he maze, creature noises are all around.
Cedric is walking along, the maze walls begin to close in on im. He makes a run for it. Fleur is running around scared, she s attacked and knocked down. Viktor comes along and sees she's nconscious on the ground, he walks on. Harry sees Fleur being wallowed into the undergrowth.
_HARRY
"Fleur? Fleur!"
He's too late she's disappeared. He sends up a red spark into he air. A heavy wind starts blowing, walls are closing in, Harry uns. Harry sees something shining in the distance and he moves owards it Viktor tries to zap him but misses.
_CEDRIC
"Get down!"
Harry ducks and Viktor gets zapped by Cedric. Cedric runs up nd kicks the wand out of Viktor's hand. He points his wand at iktor's body as if to finish him off, Harry runs up and intervenes.

_HARRY
"No stop! He's bewitched Cedric."
They struggle.
_CEDRIC
"Get off me!"
_HARRY
"He's bewitched!"
The two of them begin running towards the cup. The undergrowth rabs Cedric and he falls to the ground. Harry looks back. Cedric s pinned down with no means of escape.
_CEDRIC
"Harry! Harry!"
Harry zaps the plantlife and Cedric wriggles free. Harry helps im up.
_CEDRIC
"You know for a moment there I thought  you were gonna let it get me."
_HARRY
"For a moment so did I."
_CEDRIC
"Some game huh?"
_HARRY
"Some game."
The wind starts blowing again.
_CEDRIC
"Go. Take it, you saved me!"
_HARRY
"Together, on three. One, two, three!"

EXT. GRAVEYAR arry and Cedric have ported to a graveyard. 
_CEDRIC
"You ok?"
_HARRY
"Yeah, you?"
_CEDRIC
"Where are we?"
_HARRY
"I've been here before."
_CEDRIC
"It's a portkey. Harry the cup is a portkey."

_HARRY
"I've been here before in a dream. Cedric,  we have to get back to the cup? Now!"

_CEDRIC
"What are you talking about?"
Harry lets out a shout and holds his head, he is in pain.
_CEDRIC
"What is it?"
_HARRY
"Get back to the cup!"
We see Wormtail and Voldemort nearby. 
_CEDRIC
"Who are you? What do you want?"
_VOLDEMORT
"Kill the spare."
Wormtail casts a spell and kills Cedric.
_HARRY
"Cedric!"
Cedric lays dead on the ground ormtail pulls Harry closer, a status grabs hold of Harry and raps him.
_VOLDEMORT
"Do it, now!"
Wormtail drops something into a cauldron, Harry watches on. 

_WORMTAIL
"Bones of the father, unwillingly given. "1
A bone hovers in the air under Wormtail's control, he drops it nto the cauldron.
_WORMTAIL
"Flesh of the servent willingly sacrificed. "1
He takes a knife and slashes his arm over the cauldron.
_WORMTAIL
"Blood of the enemy forcibly taken."

He takes the knife to Harry and cuts at his arm. Harry shouts. ormtail takes the knife over to the cauldron and lets the drops all into it.
_WORMTAIL
"The dark lord shall rise again. "
The cauldron bursts into flame and a reformed Voldemort emerges.

_VOLDEMORT
"My wand Wormtail."
Wormtail hands him the wand and bows deeply.
_VOLDEMORT
"Hold out your arm."
_WORMTAIL
"Master. Thank you master."
_VOLDEMORT
"The other arm Wormtail."
Wormtail looks concerned, but does it anyway. Voldemort sticks he wand into Wormtail's arm. The sky changes, others have been ummoned.
_VOLDEMORT
"Welcome my friends. Thirty years it's  been, and yet you stand before me as  though it were only yesterday. I confess  myself disappointed, not one of you  tried to find me. "
Voldemort begins slashing angrily at the hooded figures. 
_VOLDEMORT
"Not even you, Lucius. "
_LUCIUS
"My lord. Had I detected any sign or  even a whisper of your whereabouts."

_VOLDEMORT
"There were signs my friend, and more  than whispers. "
_LUCIUS
"I assure you I never renounced the old  ways. The face I have been obliged to  present each day since your absence,  that was my true mask."
_WORMTAIL
"I returned."
_VOLDEMORT
"Out of fear, not loyalty. Still you  have proved yourself useful these past  few months Wormtail."
Voldemort grants Wormtail a new hand.
_WORMTAIL
"Thank you master, thank you."
_VOLDEMORT
(To Cedric's corpse) Oh, such a handsome 
"boy. "
_HARRY
"Don't touch him."
Harry struggles to get free.
_VOLDEMORT
"Harry! I'd almost forgotten you were  here. Standing on the bones of my father.  I'd introduce you but word has it you're  almost as famous as me these days. The  boy who lived. How lies have fed your  legend Harry. Shall I reveal what really  happened that night thirteen years ago?  Shall I divulge how I truly lost my  powers? It was love. You see when dear  sweet Lily Potter gave her life for  her only son she provided the ultimate  protection. I could not touch you. It  was old magic, something I should have  forseen. But no matter, no matter. Things  have changed, I can touch you now!"

Voldemort puts his hand on Harry's head and he screams.
_VOLDEMORT
"Astonishing what a few drops of your  blood will do eh Harry? Pick up your  wand Potter. I said pick it up, get  up. Get up! You've been taught how to  duel I presume yes? First we bow to  each other. Come on now Harry the niceties  must be observed, Dumbledore would not  want you to forget your manners now  would he? I said bow!"
Voldemort forces Harry to bow with magic.
_VOLDEMORT
"That's better. And now..."
Voldemort casts at Harry and he wriggles in pain.
_VOLDEMORT
"Atta boy Harry, your parents would be  proud. Especially your filthy mongrel  mother. I'm going to kill you Harry  Potter, I'm going to destroy you. After  tonight no one will ever again question  my powers. After tonight if they speak  of you they'll speak only of how you  begged for death, and I being a merciful  lord obliged. Get up."
Voldemort pulls Harry to his feet, Harry begins to move away.

_VOLDEMORT
"Don't you turn your back on me Harry  Potter I want you to look at me when  I kill you, I want to see the lights  leave your eyes."
Harry takes steps toward Voldemort.
_HARRY
"Have it your way."
They both cast and their streams of magic meet. They both struggle.

_VOLDEMORT
"Do nothing. He is mine to finish. He's  mine!"
Shapes form in the surrounding magical energy. We hear Dumbledore's oice.
_HARRY'S DAD
(voice) Harry when the connection is 
"broken you must get to the portkey.  We can delay it for a moment to give  you time but only a moment, do you understand?"

_CEDRIC
(voice) Harry take my body back will 
"you? Take my body back to my father."

_HARRY'S MOTHER
(voice) Let go. Sweetheart you're ready. 
"Let go! Let go!"
The connection breaks, Harry runs over to Cedric's body and summons he cup over to them. In an instant the port out. Voldemort looks ngry.
_VOLDEMORT
"No!"
EXT. AREN ack at the arena Harry appears with Cedric's body. The crowd on't understand what has taken place and they all cheer, triumphant usic starts to play. Harry weeps on Cedric's body. 
_DUMBLEDORE
"Harry! Harry!"
Dumbledore tries to prize Harry from Cedric's body.
_DUMBLEDORE
"Tell me what happened!"
_HARRY
"He's back, he's back! Voldemort's back.  Cedric, he asked me to bring his body  back. I couldn't leave him, not there."

_DUMBLEDORE
"It's alright Harry. It's alright, he's  home, you both are."
_FUDGE
"Keep everybody in their seats. A boy  has just been killed. The body must  be moved Dumbledore, there are... too  many people."
_AMOS
"Let me through! That's my son! My boy!"

Amos breaks down wailing. The crowd look on distraught.
INT. DARKENED ROO ad-Eye Moody enters and closes the door behind him. Harry is n the room still sobbing. They sit. 
_MAD-EYE
"Are you alright Potter?"
Harry nods.
_MAD-EYE
"Does it hurt?"
_HARRY
"Not so much now."
_MAD-EYE
"I'd better take a look at it."
We see Harry's arm, it has a skull and snake marking.
_HARRY
"The cup was a portkey. Someone had bewitched  it."
_MAD-EYE
"What was it like? What was he like?"

_HARRY
"Who?"
_MAD-EYE
"The dark lord. What was it like to stand  in his presence?"
_HARRY
"I dunno. It was like I'd fallen into  one of my dreams. One of my nightmares. "1
Mad-Eye starts shaking and struggling for air, he reaches for is bottle but it's empty. He rushes to a chest with other bottles nd struggles to find one.
_MAD-EYE
"Were there others? In the graveyard,  were there others?"
_HARRY
"Um. I don't think I said anything about  a graveyard Professor."
_MAD-EYE
"Marvellous creatures dragons aren't  they? Do you think that miserable oaf  would have led you into the woods if  I hadn't suggested it? Do you think  Cedric Diggory would have told you to  hold the egg under the water if I hadn't  have told him first myself? Do you think  Neville Longbottom the witless wonder  could have provided you with gilliweed  if I hadn't have given him the book  that led you straight to it? Huh??"

_HARRY
"It was you from the beginning. You put  my name in the goblet of fire. You bewitched  Krum. But..."
Mad-Eye makes sobbing noises making fun of Harry.
_MAD-EYE
"You won because I made it so Potter.  You ended up in that graveyard tonight  because it was meant to be so. And now  the deed is done. The blood that runs  through these veins runs within the  dark lord. Imagine how he will reward  me when he learns that I have once and  for all silenced the great Harry Potter."

A flash of magic occurs and Mad-Eye is knocked into the wall. umbledore and Severus come rushing in. Dumbledore takes Mad-Eye y the neck...
_DUMBLEDORE
"Severus..."
Severus administers some veritaserum. Mad-Eye wriggles demonically.

_DUMBLEDORE
"Do you know who I am?"
_MAD-EYE
"Albus Dumbledore."
_DUMBLEDORE
"Are you Alastor Moody? Are ya?"
_MAD-EYE
"No."
_DUMBLEDORE
"Is he in this room? Is he in this room?"

We see a nod.
_DUMBLEDORE
"Harry get away from there!"
Dumbledore approaches the chest. The chest opens, it contains  series of smaller chests. When the final chest is open we see hat there's a pit within holding a man the real Alastor Moody.

_DUMBLEDORE
"Are you alright Alastor?"
_ALASTOR
"I'm sorry Albus."
_HARRY
"That's Moody, but then who's...?"
Dumbledore holds up one of Mad-Eye's Bottles.
_SEVERUS
"Polyjuice potion."
_DUMBLEDORE
"Now we know who's been stealing it from  your store Severus."
Dumbledore looks into the pit.
_DUMBLEDORE
"We'll get you up in a minute."
Alastor Moody groans. The Mad-Eye Moody they have captive in  chair begins to twitch about restlessly making strange noises. e appears to be transforming. He rips off his fake eyepiece hich falls on the floor, we see that he's transformed into Barty rouch Junior.
_DUMBLEDORE
"Barty Crouch Junior."
_BARTY JR
"I'll show you mine if you show me yours."

Barty Jr rolls up his sleeve to reveal a skull and snake marking.

_DUMBLEDORE
"Your arm Harry."
_BARTY JR
"You know what this means don't you?  He's back. Lord Voldemort has returned."

_DUMBLEDORE
"Send an owl to Azkaban, think they'll  find they're missing a prisoner. "

_BARTY JR
"I'll be welcomed back like a hero."

_DUMBLEDORE
"Perhaps. Personally I've never had much  time for heroes."

INT. ASSEMBLY ROOM
_DUMBLEDORE
(Speaking to all pupils) Today we acknowledge 
"a really terrible loss. Cedric Diggory  was as you all know, exceptionally hard  working, intricately fair minded. And  most importantly a fierce fierce friend.  I think therefore you have the right  to know exactly how he died. You see,  Cedric Diggory was murdered by Lord  Voldemort. The ministry of magic does  not wish me to tell you this. But not  to do so I think would be an insult  to his memory. Now the pain we all feel  at this dreadful loss reminds me, reminds  us that while we may come from different  places and speak in different tongues,  our hearts beat as one. In light of  recent events the bonds of friendship  we made this year will be more important  than ever. Remember that and Cedric  Diggory will not have died in vain,  you remember that. And we'll celebrate  a boy who was kind and honest and brave  and true right to the very end."

INT. BEDROO arry is sitting on a bed, Dumbledore walks in.
_DUMBLEDORE
"I never liked these curtains. Set them  on fire in my fourth year, by accident  of course. I put you in terrible danger  this year Harry I'm sorry."
_HARRY
"Professor, when I was in the graveyard  there was a moment... um... when Voldemort's  wand and mine sort of connected."
_DUMBLEDORE
"Priorium Contatum. You saw your parents  that night didn't you? They reappeared."

Harry nods.
_DUMBLEDORE
"No spell can reawaken the dead Harry  I trust you know that. Dark and diffiult  times lie ahead. Soon we must all face  the choice between what is right what  is easy. But remember this, you have  friends here. You're not alone."

EXT. HOGWART here's a large crowd gathered, the pupils are going home. Viktor rum gives Hermione a kiss and hands her some paper.
_VIKTOR
"Write to me. Promise."
_HERMIONE
"Bye."
Ron is sitting alone. The french sisters approach him, they both n turn give him a kiss on the head.
_FLEUR
"Au revoir Ron."
The Beauxbatons girls leave in uniform, the crowd applauds. The urmstrang boys leave too, shaking hands as they go.
_RON
"Do you think we'll ever just have a  quiet year at Hogwarts?"
_HERMIONE
"No."
_HARRY
"No I don't think so."
_HERMIONE
"Everything's going to change now isn't  it?"
_HARRY
"Yes."
_HERMIONE
"Promise you'll write this summer. Both  of you."
_RON
"Well I won't. You know I won't!"
_HERMIONE
"Harry will won't you?"
_HARRY
"Yeah. Every week."
They look over the balcony, the flying horses pulling a carriage ead off into the distance. The Bulgarians' ship goes underwater.

FADE OUT.
