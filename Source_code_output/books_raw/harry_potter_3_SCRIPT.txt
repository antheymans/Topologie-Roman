_AUNT PETUNIA
"Well, go on. Open it."
Harry reaches for the knob when -- BLAM! -- it BURST PEN, revealing a LARGE, WADDLING WOMAN (AUNT MARGE) an  LARGE WADDLING BULLDOG (RIPPER). Uncle Vernon lurche orward out of the teeming RAIN, an ENORMOUS SUITCASE i and, and drops it on Harry.
_AUNT PETUNIA
"Marge! Welcome! How was the train?"
_AUNT MARGE
"Wretched. Ripper got sick."
_AUNT PETUNIA
"Ah. How... unfortunate."
_AUNT MARGE
"I would've left him with the others, but he pines so when I'm away. Don't you, darling?"
Aunt Marge puckers her lips at Ripper and leads him dow he hallway. Harry follows with Uncle Vernon CONTINUED)

_HARRY
"Uncle Vernon. I need you to sign this form."
_UNCLE VERNON
"What is it?"
_HARRY
"Nothing. Something for school..."
Uncle Vernon eyes the PARCHMENT in Harry's han uspiciously.
_UNCLE VERNON
"Later perhaps. If you behave."
_HARRY
"I will if she does."
_AUNT MARGE
(turning, eyeing Harry)
"So. Still here, are you?"
_HARRY
"Yes."
_AUNT MARGE
"Don't say 'yes' in that ungrateful tone. Damn good of my brother to keep you, if you ask me."
(to Vernon, Petunia)
"It'd have been straight to an orphanage if he'd been dumped on my doorstep."
Just then Dudley -- sitting comatose before the TV - mits a HOLLOW, BRAIN-DEAD CHUCKLE.
_AUNT MARGE
"Is that my Dudders! Hm? Is that my neffy poo? Come and say hello to your Auntie Marge."
Marge flashes a thick FAN of POUND NOTES. Dudley blinks addles forward, and extends his plump palm obediently arry looks on, then sees Ripper snuffling about hi nkle.

_UNCLE VERNON
"Can I tempt you, Marge?"
_AUNT MARGE
"Just a small one. A bit more... a bit more... That's the boy."
(taking a
 sloppy sip)
"Aah. Excellent nosh, Petunia. It's normally just a fry-up for me, what with twelve dogs."
She smacks her lips, lowers her brandy, and lets Rippe ake a slobbery lap out of the glass... then catche arry looking.
_AUNT MARGE
"What are you smirking at! Where is it that you send him, Vernon?"
_UNCLE VERNON
"St. Brutus's. It's a first-rate institution for hopeless cases."
Hearing this, Harry frowns, glances at Uncle Vernon, wh lares darkly at him.
_AUNT MARGE
"I see. And do they use the cane at St. Brutus's, boy?"
_HARRY
(sarcastically)
"Oh, yes. I've been beaten loads of times."
_AUNT MARGE
"Excellent. I won't have this namby-pamby wishy-washy nonsense about not hitting people who deserve it."
(another sip)
"Still. Mustn't blame yourself for how this one's turned out, Vernon. It all comes down to blood. Bad blood will out. What is it the boy's father did, Petunia?"
_AUNT PETUNIA
(agitated)
"Nothing. That is... he didn't work. He was -- unemployed."
(CONTINUED)

_AUNT MARGE
"Of course. And a drunk, I expect --"
_HARRY
"That's a lie."
Aunt Marge pauses on her wine, eyes narrowing on Harry.
_AUNT MARGE
"What did you say?"
_HARRY
"My dad wasn't a drunk."
POP! The GLASS in Aunt Marge's hand EXPLODES.
_AUNT PETUNIA
"Oh my goodness! Marge!"
_AUNT MARGE
"Not to worry, Petunia. I have a very firm grip."
Harry stares at the shattered glass in surprise.
_UNCLE VERNON
"You go to bed. Now."
_AUNT MARGE
"Quiet, Vernon. It doesn't matter about the father. In the end it comes down to the mother. You see it all the time with dogs. If there's something wrong with the bitch, there'll be something wrong with the pup..."
_HARRY
"Shut up! Shut up!"
Aunt Marge starts to reply, when -- ZING! -- a BUTTON o er dress sails into the air. SEAMS GROAN. THREA NAPS. Aunt Marge's eyes WIDEN. Her cheeks BILLOW. He hole body BILLOWS. And she begins to INFLATE like  ONSTROUS BALLOON.
_UNCLE VERNON
"MARGE!"
As she rises, Uncle Vernon leaps for her. RIPPER GROWLS ixes his teeth to his trousers. Harry frightened b hat he's done, watches Aunt Marge BOUNCE GENTLY acros he ceiling and into the CONSERVATORY.

"No! She deserved what she got! And you... you keep away from me."
Uncle Vernon eyes Harry's wand nervously, then grins wit nowing cruelty.
_UNCLE VERNON
"You're not allowed to do magic out of school. They won't have you now. You've got nowhere to go."
Harry realizes it's true. Briefly falters. Then:
_HARRY
"Anywhere's better than here."

The WIN athers arry turns, studies the swaying swings, the carousel hen, he... stiffens. Turns back. Sensing something i he shadows across the street, he rises. Slowly draw is wand hen he sees... it.

_HARRY
"I didn't do it on purpose."

Behind the wheel, ERNIE, an UNSHAVEN WIZARD in THIC LASSES, stares straight ahead, armpits stained wit weat. A SHRUNKEN HEAD dangles from the rearview mirror UTTERING incessantly through the STITCHES that lace it outh.
_STAN SHUNPIKE
"Take 'er away, Ern."

"Is it now? Get that, Ern? The Leaky Cauldron. That's in London."
Stan grins with sinister delight, showing BAD TEETH.
_SHRUNKEN HEAD
"Leaky Cauldron! Stay away from the pea soup!"
As the Shrunken Head CACKLES with delight, Harry peer ut the windscreen, watches London careering by.
_HARRY
"Isn't this a bit... dangerous?"
_STAN SHUNPIKE
"Naah. Haven't had an accident in -- what? -- a week is it, Ern?"
_SHRUNKEN HEAD
"Heads up! Little old lady at twelve o'clock!"

"Tha's the question, isn't it? He's the firs' that's done it. Gives me the collywobbles thinking he's out there, though, I'll tell you that. Big supporter of You- Know-'Oo, Black was. Reckon you heard o' him."
Harry nods and, as he does, Black's eyes shift. Mee arry's.

_HERMIONE
"Harry? Harry, are you all right?"
Hermione's troubled face hovers above him. He nods its up. Ron -- pale, nervous -- extends his hand arry's glasses.
_HARRY
"Thanks."
Harry slips them on. Discovers the cold sweat glazin is brow. SNAP! Professor Lupin breaks a ragge riangle of CHOCOLATE off the SLAB in his hands. Hold t out.
_PROFESSOR LUPIN
"Chocolate. Eat. It'll help."
_HARRY
"What was that -- that thing?"
_PROFESSOR LUPIN
"A Dementor. One of the guards of Azkaban. It's gone now."
Harry frowns in confusion.
_HERMIONE
"It was searching the train, Harry. For Sirius Black."
_PROFESSOR LUPIN
"I need to have a word with the driver. Excuse me."

_HARRY
"And did either of you? You know... pass out?"
_RON
"No. I felt... weird. Like I'd never be cheerful again. But... no."
Harry turns to Hermione. She shakes her head.
_HERMIONE
"I was trembling. Cold. But then... Professor Lupin made it go away..."
_HARRY
"But someone was screaming. A woman."
Hermione and Ron glance nervously at each other.

At the High Table, Lupin sits with SEVERUS SNAPE, MINERV cGONAGALL, RUBEUS HAGRID and ALBUS DUMBLEDORE. We TRAC LONG the FACES of the choir, singing to the strains of  ARPSICHORD, and LAND ON a QUINTET OF TOADS (one o hich -- TREVOR -- belongs to NEVILLE LONGBOTTOM, wh ooks on with pride) RGUS FILCH, Hogwarts' caretaker, stands grimly to th ide as red-eyed MRS.

_DUMBLEDORE
"Welcome! Welcome to another year at Hogwarts! I have a few things to say, before we become befuddled by our excellent feast. I myself am particularly looking forward to the flaming kiwi cups, which, while somewhat treacherous for those of us with facial hair..."
McGONAGALL clears her throat.
_DUMBLEDORE
"Mm. Yes. First, I'm pleased to welcome Professor R.J. Lupin, who has kindly consented to fill the post of Defense Against the Dark Arts. Good luck to you, Professor."
Amid SCATTERED APPLAUSE, Harry, Ron, Hermione CLA OUDLY.
_HERMIONE
"Of course! That's why he knew to give you the chocolate, Harry."
_DUMBLEDORE
"As some of you may know, Professor Kettleburn, our Care of Magical Creatures teacher for many years, has decided to retire in order to spend more time with his remaining limbs. Fortunately, I'm delighted to announce that his place will be filled by none other than our own Rubeus Hagrid!"

Harry, Ron, and Hermione stare at each other - tunned -- then APPLAUD vigorously. Hagrid turns rub ed, rises, and nearly topples the staff table, sendin ater goblets weaving.

"Finally, on a more disquieting note, Hogwarts -- at the request of the Ministry of Magic -- will, until further notice, play host to the Dementors of Azkaban."
A MURMUR of apprehension fills the hall. At th lytherin table, DRACO MALFOY, flanked by the ever resent CRABBE and GOYLE, catches Harry's eye, feign  dead faint.
_DUMBLEDORE
"The Dementors will be stationed at the entrances to the grounds. While they are under strict orders not to enter the castle itself, you will on occasion see them as you go about your daily activities. Under no circumstances are you to approach them.

_PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY

"Professor Trelawney. Together, we shall cast ourselves into the future. But know this. One either has the Gift or not. It cannot be divined from the pages of a book. Books only cloud one's Inner Eye."

Ron spins. Frowns at Hermione.
_RON
"Where'd you come from?"
_HERMIONE

_NEVILLE
"I... I think so."
_PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY
"I wouldn't be so sure of that."

Parvati eyes Ron dubiously. Edges her pouffe away.
_PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY
"Unfortunately, classes will be disrupted in February by a nasty bout of flu. I myself will lose my voice. And in late spring, one of our number will... leave us forever."
As the class exchanges uneasy glances, Trelawney smile rightly.
_PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY
"Well then. Shall we?"

Trelawney takes Lavender Brown's cup, peers inside.
_PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY
"A five-leaf clover... You can expect to wake with a horrible rash tomorrow morning, dear."

"Mr. Longbottom, after you've broken your first cup..."

Professor Trelawney takes the cup, peers inside, an ASPS.
_PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY

"What is it, Professor?"
Trelawney regards Harry with a mixture of pity and fear.
_PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY

 discipline. Now Ancient Runes.
_That's a fascinating subject.
_RON
_Ancient Runes? Exactly how many
 classes are you taking this term?
_HERMIONE
_A fair few.
_RON
_Hang on. Ancient Runes is the
 same time as Divination. You'd

Hagrid leads them toward a small paddock just this sid f the Forbidden Forest. In the paddock, a freestandin RON RACK hangs with DEAD FERRETS, BUZZING with FLIES earby is a PUMPKIN PATCH.

Hagrid looks. Belts, rope, Spellotape: any mean vailable have been employed to bridle The Monster Boo f Monsters, which QUIVER VIOLENTLY.
_HAGRID
"Crikey. Didn' yeh know? All yeh've got ter do is stroke 'em. Look --"
Hagrid takes Hermione's copy, SNAPS the Spellotap inding it. As it begins to BITE, Hagrid calmly runs  orefinger down the book's spine and it... SHIVERS alls quietly open agrid glances at the class, looking suddenly unsure.
_HAGRID
"Righ' then. So... so... yeh've got yer books, an' now yeh need the Magical Creatures. Right. So... I'll... I'll go an' get 'em."
Hagrid turns, disappears into the trees. Draco shake is head, SPEAKS LOUDLY to Crabbe and Goyle.

"God, this place is going to the dogs. Wait until my father hears Dumbledore's got this oaf teaching classes."
_HARRY
"Listen, you stupid prat --"
Eyes WIDENING in fear, Malfoy steps back, points.
_DRACO
"Potter, there's a Dementor behind you."
Harry JUMPS, wheels in fear, finds... nothing. Instantly he SLYTHERINS make an eerie OOH... and OOH sound, the reak up laughing. Harry reddens, embarrassed, then..  STRANGE BEAST (BUCKBEAK) emerges from the trees. I as the torso, hind legs, and tail of a horse, but th ront legs, wings and head of a giant eagle. Th tudents step back in fear, then Hagrid appears, shooin he beast on.
_HAGRID
"Gee up, there!"

"Beau'iful, isn' he?"

44 CONTINUED: (2)

There seems no consensus on this, but the students star n wary wonder nonetheless. As Hagrid coaxes the beas o the center of the paddock, Ron stares uneasily.
_RON
"Hagrid. Exactly what is that?"
_HAGRID
"A Hippogriff, o' course. Now, firs' thing yeh gotta know is they're proud. Easily offended, Hippogriffs are. Don't never insult one, 'cause it migh' be the las' thing yeh do. Right then -- who wants ter come an' say hello?"
The entire class STEPS BACK, leaving Harry in front.
_HAGRID
"Good man, Harry!"
Harry looks around, then -- reluctantly -- approaches.
_HAGRID
"Tha's it. Easy now... stop! This here's Buckbeak, Harry. Yeh want ter let 'im make the firs' move. It's polite, see? Jus' take step forward, give 'im a bow, and if Buckbeak bows back, yeh're allowed ter touch him. Ready?"
Unsure, Harry nods anyway. Steps forward. And... bows uckbeak's head cocks, eagle eyes studying Harry cannily arry waits. And waits...
_HAGRID
"Back off, Harry! Back off!"
Harry starts to step back, when... Buckbeak ducks hi eak. Hagrid sighs, relieved.

"Well done, Harry! Go on. Give"
 'im a pat.
Tentatively, Harry reaches out, lays his hand o uckbeak's fierce beak. The class CLAPS. Harr miles CONTINUED)

"Excuse me?"
_HAGRID
"We'll jus' set yeh behind the wing joint. Mind yeh don' pull any feathers out. He won' like that."
Hagrid lifts Harry high, drops him onto Buckbeak' ack, and before Harry's settled, SLAPS Buckbeak' indquarters.
_HAGRID
"Off yeh go!"
As Buckbeak GALLOPS FORWARD, Harry slides scarily back iant WINGS unfold, huge and powerful, and -- WHOOSH! - hey SOAR into the air. Rising higher. And higher nd higher radually, Harry loosens his hold on Buckbeak's neck osing himself in the joy of flying. Smiling at th ight of his and Buckbeak's SHADOW racing across th rass below. Circling over the Whomping Willow, pas ogwarts castle, and then SWOOPING, with heart-stoppin peed, over the Black Lake, Buckbeak's talons ticklin he smooth glass of the water, summoning the GIANT SQUI o the surface briefly. Hagrid WHISTLES then, an uckbeak wheels, beating his way back to the paddock alloping to a halt. As Harry slides off, the clas HEERS -- all except Draco, who narrows his eye aliciously.
_HAGRID

"How'm I doin' me firs' day?"

"Brilliant... Professor."
They both grin, when Draco pushes past them roughly trides toward Buckbeak CONTINUED)

"Give me a go at that thing. If Potter can do it, it must be easy. You're not dangerous at all, are you, you great ugly brute --"

In a flash, Buckbeak's steely talons SLASH DOWN. Malfo reezes. Looks down at the BLOOD BLOSSOMING on hi obes. SHRIEKS. Instantly, Harry dashes forward uckbeak WHIPS AROUND, raises its talons and -- seein arry -- lowers them. Ducks its beak. Harry.. ealizing what he's done... breathes.
_DRACO
"It's killed me! It's killed me!"
_HAGRID
"Calm yerself! Yer fine... jus' a scratch..."
Hagrid looks: a DEEP GASH glistens on Draco's lim rm.
_HERMIONE
"Hagrid. He's got to be taken to a hospital. I'll go with you, if you like --"
_HAGRID
"No. I'm the teacher. You all... you all just... Class dismissed!"
And with that, Hagrid -- looking shaken -- swoops u alfoy, flops him over his shoulder, and lumber oward the castle.

"The little git. He's really laying it on thick, isn't he?"
_HARRY
"At least Hagrid didn't get sacked."
_HERMIONE
"Yes. But I hear Draco's father's furious. I don't think we've heard the end of this..."
_SEAMUS
"He's been sighted!"
They turn. Seamus and the other Gryffindors are huddle ver a copy of The Daily Prophet.
_RON
"Who?"
But the PHOTOGRAPH on the Prophet's front page provides  hilling answer: Sirius Black. Hermione reads over th houlders of others. WHISPERS half to herself:

_NEVILLE

_SEAMUS

"That's a Boggart, that is."
_PROFESSOR LUPIN
"Very good, Mr. Finnigan. Can anyone tell us what a Boggart looks like?"

Ron JUMPS, glances at Hermione, then WHISPERS to Harry.

_HERMIONE
"Boggarts are shape-shifters. They take the shape of whatever a particular person fears most. That's what makes it so --"

_STUDENTS
"Riddikulus!"
_DRACO
(muttering softly)
"It's this class that's ridiculous."
_PROFESSOR LUPIN
"Good. So much for the easy part. You see, the incantation alone is not enough. What really finishes a Boggart off is... laughter. You need to force it to assume a shape you find truly amusing. Neville, come up here, will you?"
Neville eyes the rattling wardrobe, steps forwar ueasily.
_PROFESSOR LUPIN
"What would you say is the thing that frightens you most?"
_NEVILLE
"Profter... Snafpt..."

_NEVILLE
(closing his eyes)
"She carries a red handbag..."
_PROFESSOR LUPIN
"That's fine. We don't need to hear it. If you see it, we will. Now, when I open this wardrobe, Neville, here's what I want you to do..."
Lupin leans close to Neville, WHISPERS. Neville's eye OP OPEN in shock. Consider Lupin uncertainly.
_PROFESSOR LUPIN
"You can do this, Neville."
Neville nods nervously, takes a deep breath.
_PROFESSOR LUPIN
"Right then. Wand at the ready. One. Two. Three!"
SPARKS jet from Lupin's wand, strike the doorknob, an he wardrobe BURSTS OPEN. Instantly, Snape appears, eye lashing hideously as he stalks forward. Neville back way in fright.

_Well, don't feel too bad. I was
 roundly disappointed the first
 time I went.
_HARRY
_Really?

_No. I was just trying to make you

_HARRY
"Professor, can I ask you something?"
_PROFESSOR LUPIN
"You'd like to know why I stopped you from facing the Boggart."

"I should think it'd be obvious. I assumed the Boggart would take the shape of Lord Voldemort."
Harry frowns. Lupin studies him curiously.

"But clearly... I was wrong."
_HARRY
"I did think of Voldemort first. But then, I remembered that night on the train... and the Dementors..."

_HARRY
"Before I fainted... I heard something. A woman. Screaming."

"The first time I saw you, Harry, I recognized you immediately. Not by your scar. By your eyes. They're your mother Lily's."
(nodding)
"Yes. I knew her. She was there for me at a time when no one else was. We used to talk for hours. She was not only a singularly gifted witch but an uncommonly kind woman. She had a way of seeing the beauty in whoever she met, even -- and perhaps most especially -- when that person couldn't see it in themselves..."
Lupin's eyes glaze in memory, then he blinks, smiles.

"Which perhaps explains her affection for your father. James had, shall we say, a certain talent for trouble. A gift, rumor has it, he passed on to you."
Lupin turns, eyes Harry affectionately. Harry smile aguely.
_PROFESSOR LUPIN
"I could tell you stories -- and there are many about your parents, Harry -- but know this..."
(eyeing Harry intensely)
"They lived. Every moment of every day. You should know that. That's how they'd want to be remembered."

56 INT. GREAT HALL - EVENING (LATER)

The Hall buzzes with tales of Hogsmeade, as students swa tories, sample sweets, and send SOAP BUBBLES of al hapes, sizes and colors into the air. A MARIONETTE of  ARLEQUIN cavorts atop the Gryffindor table, moving it imbs in response to the STRANDS of LIGHT that exten rom Neville's fingertips.

Harry nods, picking quietly through the spray o rilliantly colored sweets on the table. Hermion otices.
_HERMIONE
"But, I mean, after awhile, it got a bit boring. Don't you think, Ron?"
_RON
"Huh? Oh. Yeah. Dead depressing. Hang on. I almost forgot. I got you something wicked at Dervish and Banges. It's a Pocket Sneakoscope."
Ron places a SMALL GLASS SPINNING TOP on the table.
_RON
"If there's someone untrustworthy around, it's meant to light up and spin. Mind you, Fred and George say it's rubbish, sold for wizard tourists, but I thought, you know, it can't hurt, given that..."
_HARRY
"Sirius Black's trying to kill me."
Harry looks up, GRINS at the two of them.
_HARRY
"I'm glad you had a good time. Really. And thanks for this."
(eyeing the Sneakoscope)
"Rubbish or not, you're right. It can't hurt."

Filch extends a crooked finger. High up, near th eiling, the Fat Lady cowers in a portrait not her own rembling.

"Dear lady. Who did this to you?"
_FAT LADY
(in a trance)
"Eyes like the devil he's got. And a soul as dark as his name. It was him, Headmaster. The one they talk about. He's here. Somewhere in the castle. Sirius Black."
As the students REACT, Dumbledore's VOICE cuts through.

_SNAPE
"Remarkable feat, don't you think? To enter Hogwarts castle on one's own, completely undetected..."
Dumbledore gazes at the students, refusing to take th ait.
_SNAPE
"You may recall, prior to the start of term, I did express my concerns when you appointed Professor --"
_DUMBLEDORE
"I do not believe a single professor inside this castle would have helped Sirius Black enter it, Severus."
As Snape's eyes glitter darkly, Dumbledore gazes out ove he slumbering students.
_DUMBLEDORE
"No... I feel quite confident the castle is safe. And I'm more than willing to let the students return to their Houses. But tomorrow. For now, let them sleep..."

_HARRY
"Excuse me, sir, but... where's Professor Lupin?"
_SNAPE
"That's not really your concern, is it, Potter? Suffice it to say, your Professor finds himself incapable of teaching at the present time. Page"
Snape waves the MOTH away, blows out a candle and a SLID HOW BEGINS. An ANCIENT WOODCUT of a HORRIFIC BEAS lickers at the front of the room. Ron frowns down a is book.
_RON
"Werewolves?"

_SNAPE
"No one? How... disappointing."
_HERMIONE
Please, sir, an Animagus is a wizard who elects to tur nto an animal. A werewolf has no choice in the matter urthermore, the werewolf actively hunts humans an esponds only to the call of its own kind - alfoy lets out a LOW HOWL.
_SNAPE
"Quiet, Malfoy! Though one must admit to feeling your pain. That is the second time you have spoken out of turn, Miss Granger. Tell me. Are you incapable of restraining yourself? Or do you take pride in being an insufferable know-it-all?"
_RON
(to Harry)
"He's got a point, you know."
Harry stares at the parchment. Malfoy has drawn a crud aricature of Harry in his Quidditch robes being STRUC Y LIGHTNING over and over.
_SNAPE
"Five points from Gryffindor!"

"As a antidote to your ignorance, I prescribe two rolls of parchment on the werewolf by Monday morning, with particular emphasis placed on recognizing it."

_PROFESSOR LUPIN
"Dementors are among the foulest creatures that walk this earth. They feed on every good feeling, every happy memory, until a person is left with nothing but his worst experiences. You're not weak, Harry. The Dementors affect you most, because there are true horrors in your past. Horrors your classmates can scarcely imagine. You have nothing to be ashamed of."

_PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
"Little lump of a boy? Always tagging after Black and..."
_MADAM ROSMERTA
"I remember him. What's he got to do with it?"
_PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
"After the Potters were killed, Pettigrew went looking for Black. And, unfortunately... found him."
_CORNELIUS FUDGE
"Black was vicious. He didn't kill Pettigrew. He destroyed him. A finger. That's all that was left. A finger -- there's your hearsay."
Rosmerta looks to McGonagall. She nods grimly.
_PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
"Sirius Black may not have put his hands to the Potters, but he's the reason they're dead. And now he wants to finish what he started."
_MADAM ROSMERTA
"Harry."

McGonagall nods, then looks pained.
_CORNELIUS FUDGE
"But that's not the worst of it."
_MADAM ROSMERTA
"What could be worse?"
_PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
"This: Sirius Black was and remains today... Harry Potter's godfather."

84 EXT. OUTSKIRTS OF TOWN - DAY (MOMENTS LATER)

At the end of a ROCKY OUTCROP, the FOOTPRINTS end an OBS are heard. Ron takes Hermione's arm, discouragin er from going further, but she does, filling th ootprints with her own, then kneeling and -- very gentl - drawing the cloak from Harry. He stares into th ist, eyes stinging with tears.
_HARRY
"He was their friend. And he betrayed them. He was their friend."
(eyes hardening)
"I hope he finds me. But when he does, I'm going to be ready. When he does, I'm going to kill him."

85 EXT. HOGWARTS CASTLE - DUSK (TRANSITION TO SPRING)

Butterflies flutter over the great green lawn. The GIAN QUID breaks through the last GLAZE of ICE on the Blac ake. The Whomping Willow shakes the water from it ranches...


86 INT. ASTRONOMY ROOM - DUSK

The DYING SUN streams through high windows, paintin arry's face a fierce AMBER-RED as he stands opposit upin. ANCIENT CHARTS drape the walls while gleamin PHERES OF SPUN GLASS ORBIT one another silently. Lupi aces before a LARGE TRUNK.
_PROFESSOR LUPIN
"You're sure about this, Harry? This is very advanced magic. Well beyond Ordinary Wizarding Level."
_HARRY
"If Black can fight the Dementors, I need to know how too."
Lupin studies Harry -- as if conflicted -- then decides.
_PROFESSOR LUPIN
"Very well. The spell I'm going to teach you is called the Patronus Charm. Ever hear of it?"
Harry shakes his head.
_PROFESSOR LUPIN
"A Patronus is a kind of positive force. For the wizard who can conjure one, the Patronus works something like a shield. The Dementor feeds on it instead of him."
Just then, the trunk RATTLES VIOLENTLY. As Harry's eye ander, Lupin SNAPS his fingers, brings his attentio ack.
_PROFESSOR LUPIN
"But in order for it to work, you must think of a memory. And not just any. This memory needs to be a very happy one. And powerful."
Harry thinks a bit. Then... nods.
_PROFESSOR LUPIN
"Got something? Good. Let it fill you up. Lose yourself in it. Then speak the incantation: Expecto Patronum. Without your wand..."
_HARRY
"Expecto Patronum..."

_PROFESSOR LUPIN
"Right then. Shall we?"
Harry nods, raises his wand. Lupin, watching closely eaches over, grips the lid of the TRUNK...
_PROFESSOR LUPIN
"Concentrate, Harry. Concentrate..."
As Lupin FLINGS open the case, Harry OPENS HIS EYES. I he sun's BLOOD-LIGHT, the Dementor looks particularl orrific.
_HARRY
"Expecto... Patronum..."
The torches on the wall FLICKER as a CHILL BREEZE fill he chamber. A SCREAM ECHOES distantly. Harry's han rembles. His eyes begin to roll up...
_HARRY
"Expecto... Expecto..."
_PROFESSOR LUPIN
"Here!"
CRACK! -- the Dementor mutates into a SILVERY WHITE ORB.
_PROFESSOR LUPIN
"Riddikulus!"
Lupin flicks his wand, sends the orb back into th acking case. Harry stands blinking. Dazed. Lupi ishes a CHOCOLATE FROG from his pocket. Presses it int arry's trembling hand.
_PROFESSOR LUPIN
"Quickly."
Harry studies the frog. Takes a bite. Begins t ecover.
_HARRY
"That's one nasty Dementor."
_PROFESSOR LUPIN
"Boggart, Harry. The real thing would be much, much worse. Just out of interest, what were you thinking of? What memory did you choose?"

_HARRY
"The first time I rode a broom."
_PROFESSOR LUPIN
"That's not good enough, Harry. Not nearly."
Harry glances toward the window, at the bloody sun.
_HARRY
"There's another. It's not happy exactly. I mean, it is. It's the happiest I've ever felt. But it's... complicated."
_PROFESSOR LUPIN
"Is it strong?"
Harry looks up into Lupin's eyes. Emotional. Nods.
_PROFESSOR LUPIN
"Then let's try it."
Harry takes a breath. Tosses the frog aside. Poise imself.
_PROFESSOR LUPIN
"Think, Harry, think --"
_HARRY
"Just do it!"
Lupin blinks at Harry's quiet fierceness. Opens th acking case. Instantly, the Dementor appears again.  hill fills the air. The hair skates off Harry's scar e sets his jaw...
_HARRY
"Expecto Patronum!"
Harry's hand TREMBLES. His whole BODY TREMBLES. But h olds his ground, when -- WHOOSH! -- a huge SILVER SHADO URSTS from the end of his wand, hovering between him an he Dementor. The Dementor falters... Harry's legs lik ater...

"I think I've had enough. For today."
Lupin nods. Watches Harry move to the door.
_PROFESSOR LUPIN
"So you know, Harry: You'd have given your father a run for his money. And, believe me, that's saying something."
Harry ponders this. Then speaks, deep inside himself.
_HARRY
"I was thinking of him. And Mum. Seeing their faces. They're just talking to me. Just... talking. That was the memory I chose. I don't even know if it's real..."
Harry grips the door, pushes past.
_HARRY
"But it's the best I have."

A WHISTLE SHRIEKS. The Sneakoscope, whirling madly kitters across the bedside cabinet and -- CLICK! CLICK LICK! -- taps against a WATER GLASS, sending shafts o ED LIGHT pinwheeling over the photo of Harry' arents...
_RON
"Aaaahhhh!"
Harry BOLTS UP, sees a SILHOUETTE etched on the window -  MAN CLUTCHING A KNIFE. All the boys are up now creaming. Amid the chaos, Harry grabs his wand.
_HARRY
"Everybody out!"
The others flee. Harry faces the HULKING SHADOW, wan oised.
_HARRY
"Show yourself."
Crash! The water GLASS SHATTERS on the floor an cabbers darts past Harry's bare feet, chased b rookshanks. Seizing the moment, the SILHOUETTE grasp he curtains and swings through the open window, plungin nto the night. Harry rushes to the window, looks down.

The entire Gryffindor House, in pajamas, stand befor cGonagall, who wears a TARTAN ROBE and an expression o ingular irritation.
_PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
"That's preposterous, Weasley. How could Sirius Black possibly have got through the portrait hole?"
_RON
"I don't know how he got in! I was a bit busy dodging his knife!"
Just then, a curiously content Crookshanks wends his wa hrough Ron's legs.
_RON
"And this bloody cat ate my rat!"
_HERMIONE
"That's a lie!"
_RON
"It is not and you bloody well know it!"
_PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
"Silence!"
McGonagall turns then and everyone follows her eye to Si adogan who, sensing the attention, perks up instantly.
_DUMBLEDORE
"Sir Cadogan. Is it possible that you let a mysterious man enter Gryffindor Tower tonight?"
_SIR CADOGAN
"Certainly, good lady! He had the password. Had the whole week's, in fact. On a little piece of paper."
_PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
"Which abysmally foolish person wrote down the passwords and then proceeded to lose them!"
Every eye shifts once more: Neville. McGonagall sighs.
_PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
"Is it always going to be you, Longbottom?"

A collective nod of the head. McGonagall gives the tie f her robe a sharp tug, collects herself, and exits.
_PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
_Very well then. Go to bed.
As the students drift off, Ron casts a last angry glanc oward Hermione, who now holds Crookshanks in her arms.

 rat.

_No, I won't. Know why? Because I

_I don't care about your stupid
 cat! I've got few other things on
 my mind right now!
_RON
_Really? Wasn't you had to roll
 under the bed last night to avoid
 getting cut to ribbons! A person

Ron stops, wishes he could take it back. They all wis e could. Avoiding each other's eyes, they turn ontinue on.

Hagrid, wearing a GIGANTIC, HAIRY BROWN SUIT and perhap he world's ugliest YELLOW AND ORANGE TIE, stands knee eep in the shallows of the Black Lake, skimming rocks a ig as flagstones across the water's shiny gloss.

_HERMIONE
_How'd it go, Hagrid?
_HAGRID
_Buckbeak liked London.
_HERMIONE
_I meant the hearing.
_HAGRID
_Oh. That. Well, I got up an'
 said my bit -- You know, how
_Buckbeak was a good Hippogriff an'
 as long as yeh treated 'im with

_HAGRID
"Buckbeak's not going back to the forest..."

"Where's he going, Hagrid?"
_HAGRID

Then... as th wo DOTS are about to collide... he looks slowly up.. urns the corner... heart in his chest... and meets.. IMSEL .. reflected in a MIRROR. He BLINKS, startled, the lances back down at the map. Pettigrew has moved pas im. Confused, Harry wheels, casts his wand along th alls.
_VOICE (O.S.)
"Watch it there, boy!"
Harry JUMPS. But it's only an OLD MAN in a PAINTING cowling in the glare of Harry's wand light. On the map,
"Pettigrew" continues to move away. Harry makes to
follow, then stops. HEARS FOOTSTEPS. The WAND'S SPO ances across the parchment, finds another DOT pproaching FAST: "Severus Snape."
_HARRY
"Mischief managed!"
Harry stashes the map, extinguishes his wand, an urns... into the harsh glare of Snape's wand.

_Strutting about the castle --

_My dad didn't strut. Nor do I.
_Now, if you don't mind, I'd
 appreciate you lowering your wand.
Snape eyes Harry coldly. Containing himself. Lowers hi and.
_SNAPE
_Turn out your pockets.
Harry doesn't move, eyes still boring into Snape.
_SNAPE
_Turn out your pockets!
Finally, Harry obliges. Seeing the map, Snape's eye litter.
_SNAPE
_And this. What might it be?
_HARRY
_Spare bit of parchment...
_SNAPE
_Really...
(poising his wand)
_Reveal your secret!
To Harry's horror, words begin to appear. Snape studie im, a sadistic half-smile on his lips. Turns the ma is way.

Snape turns. Sees Lupin standing in the shadows.
_SNAPE
_Well, well. Lupin. Out for a little
 walk in the moonlight, are we?
_PROFESSOR LUPIN
_Harry? You all right?
_SNAPE
_That remains to be seen. I've
 just now confiscated a rather
 curious artifact from Mr. Potter.
_Take a look, Lupin. This is
 supposed to be your area of
 expertise.
Lupin takes the parchment, which now displays a rathe nflattering caricature of Snape and a pair of potions.
_SNAPE
_Clearly, it's full of Dark Magic.
_PROFESSOR LUPIN
_I seriously doubt that, Severus.
_It looks to me as if it merely

_I'm astounded that you didn't turn
 it in. Did you ever stop to think
 that this -- in the hands of
_Sirius Black -- is a map to you?
Harry walks silently. Lupin can barely contain his anger.
_PROFESSOR LUPIN
_Your father didn't set much store
 by rules either. But he and your
 mother did give their lives to
 save yours. Gambling their
 sacrifice by walking about the
 castle unprotected, with a killer
 on the loose, strikes me as a poor
 way to repay them. I won't cover
 up for you again, Harry.
Lupin enters his office, tosses the map on his desk, an egins to sort through some papers. Harry linger riefly in the doorway, absently eyes the WAXING MOO hat glimmers beyond the window, then starts to tur way. Stops.
_HARRY
_Professor. Just so you know, I

Lupin hesitates ever-so-slightly, then returns to hi apers.

_Very well. I'd like you to return

Lupin ignores them, eying Black intensely.

_Looking a bit ragged, aren't we,
_Sirius? Finally the skin reflects
 the madness within.
_SIRIUS BLACK
_You'd know all about the madness

The two regard each other, the moment taut with tension hen Lupin steps forward and... EMBRACES Black like  rother.
_HERMIONE
_No! I trusted you! I covered up
 for you. And all this time you've
 been his friend!

 been missing classes!
Harry and Ron stare, dumbfounded, at Lupin. Black HOWL hen, bitterly amused. Lupin eyes him, then turns back.

_PROFESSOR LUPIN
_You're the brightest witch of your

_HARRY
_No!
Harry raises his wand when Lupin wheels and, with a flic f his own, disarms him. Furious, Harry eyes Blac urderously.
_HARRY
_You betrayed my parents! You sold

_PROFESSOR LUPIN

_HARRY
_Did he listen! When my mother was
 dying! Did he hear her screaming!
_SIRIUS BLACK
_No! I wasn't there! And I'll
 regret it the rest of my life!
Harry's eyes flash to Black's, glittering with pain.
_PROFESSOR LUPIN
_Someone else betrayed your
 parents, Harry. Someone in this

Ron draws back from Black's demented gaze.

_SNAPE
_I told Dumbledore you were helping
 your old friend into the castle.
_And here's the proof.
_SIRIUS BLACK
_Brilliant! And -- as usual --

As Black approaches, Snape puts his wand to Black's neck.

_Listen to you two. Quarreling
 like an old married couple. The
 creature and the criminal.
_SIRIUS BLACK
_Piss off.
_SNAPE
_Witty as ever I see. Tell me,
 will you be so irreverent when I
 turn you over to the Dementors?
(as Black reacts)
_Do I detect a flicker of fear?
_One can only imagine what it must
 be like to endure the Dementor's
_Kiss. It's said to be unbearable
 to witness. But I'll do my best.
Snape's eyes harden. He gestures to the door.

As the others start to go, Harry glances at the tabl here Lupin has left Harry's wand. In a flash, it's i is hand.
_HARRY

Snape soars into the air, hits the wall with a THUD, an lides down. Ron and Hermione stare in shock.
_HERMIONE
_You attacked a teacher.

Harry looks a bit shocked himself, then turns to Black.

_HARRY
_The Map was lying then --
_SIRIUS BLACK
_The Map never lies. Pettigrew's

Black points at... Ron. Ron goes white with fear.
_RON

_SIRIUS BLACK
_Not you, you idiot. Your rat.
_RON
_Scabbers? Scabbers has been in my

_SIRIUS BLACK

_Twelve years. A curiously long
 life for a common garden rat.
_He's missing a toe, isn't he?
Black unfolds a dog-eared clipping from The Dail rophet: it shows Ron in Egypt with his family, Scabber n his shoulder.
_RON
_So what?
_HARRY
_All they could find of Pettigrew

_SIRIUS BLACK
_Finger. Dirty coward cut it off
 so everyone would think he was
 dead. Then he transformed into a
 rat.

_HARRY
_Show me.
Lupin and Black turn to Ron. He holds Scabber rotectively.
_RON
_What are you going to do to him?
Sirius and Lupin exchange a glance.
_SIRIUS BLACK
_Together.
With that, Lupin takes out his wand and, as one, he an lack cast a stream of BLUE-WHITE LIGHT. Scabbers twist adly in midair, then -- FLASH! -- transforms into...  ery short man with thinning hair and grubby hands ETER PETTIGREW.

Neither speaks. Pettigrew's small, watery eyes dar oward the windows and door. Suddenly, he makes  reak for it, but Sirius merely shoves him back ettigrew's nose twitches, his gaze finding Harry. Hi ands flutter nervously, reveal a MISSING INDEX FINGER.
_PETTIGREW

_James. We were the best of

_SIRIUS BLACK

 would you have done!

Ron draws back in disgust. Pettigrew turns to Hermione.
_PETTIGREW
_Sweet girl. Clever girl. Surely
 you won't let them...
As one, Lupin and Black raise their wands, point the irectly into Pettigrew's face. He shrinks bac rembling, closing his eyes in fear, when...

Pettigrew's lids lift. Lupin and Black turn. Staggered.

(as Ron emerges)
"Ron! Haven't I been a good friend? A good pet? You won't let them kill me, will you? I was your rat..."
As Ron draws back in disgust, a sleepwalking Snape BUMP is head against a low limb. Hermione turns to Harry.
_HERMIONE
"Don't worry. He's under the Somnambulist Charm. It's primarily used to transport the seriously deranged."
As Harry nods, Pettigrew's pleading eyes find Hermione.
_PETTIGREW
"Sweet girl. Clever girl. Surely you won't let them..."
Hermione tugs her robes from Pettigrew's sweaty grasp arry turns, sees Black staring in wonder at the castle hining radiantly under the bright bowl of the night sky.
_SIRIUS BLACK
"Beautiful, isn't it? I'll never forget the first time I walked through those doors. It'll be nice to do it again. Freely."
(turning to Harry)
"That was a noble thing you did back there. He doesn't deserve it."
Harry studies Pettigrew briefly, looks away. Lost i hought.
_HARRY

_HERMIONE
_Yes! You Must!
(pointing inside)
_Harry, you're in Hagrid's hut
 right now. If you go bursting

A udge appears at the window and picks his nose as before ermione ponders the back of her own head.
_HERMIONE
_Is that really what my hair looks
 like from the back?
_HARRY
_Shhh!
Hermione sees herself turn. Ducking, she accidentall tirs the branches, then peeks out and sees hersel taring curiously at the branches DANCING ODDLY. Nex he hears her own voice:

_HAGRID
_Professor, I swear! I didn't!
_DUMBLEDORE
_I'm quite sure the Minister isn't
 suggesting that you had anything
 to do with it, Hagrid. How could
 you? You've been with us all
 along.
_CORNELIUS FUDGE
_We should search the grounds --
_DUMBLEDORE
_Search the skies if you must,
_Minister. In the meantime, I
 wouldn't say no to a cup of tea,
_Hagrid. Or... a large brandy.
(to the Executioner)
_It seems your services will no

 he'd like that, after all those
 years in Azkaban. We don't need a

A HOWL pierces the night. Hermione glances toward th illow.
