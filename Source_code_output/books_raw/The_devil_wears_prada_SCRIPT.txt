3 CONTINUED:

_GUARD
"Honey, you want West 57th."

4 EXT. 57TH STREET -- DAY

ANDY runs, but she's moving against the pedestrian tide. W iden out to see ANDY, bucking the flow like a salmon goin pstream he gets to an intersection, starts to cross the street.. ..and just misses being decked by a bike messenger.

5 EXT. ELIAS-CLARKE -- DAY

ANDY sees a tower looming in front of her. Elias-Clarke treaming into the building are the polished GIRLS we saw i he opening... their heels click-clack on the concrete.. hey are the CLACKERS of Elias-Clarke. ANDY runs in.

7 INT. ELIAS-CLARKE ELEVATOR -- DAY

ANDY is a shrub in a CLACKER forest. One turns to another.
_CLACKER #1
"You look awesome today. I can't wear cropped pants. I look like a whale."
_CLACKER #2
"Oh, please. I look terrible. I almost called in fat today."
ANDY looks at them, then down at herself. If they're fat hat am I? Ding! Elevator opens and ANDY exits.

8 INT. ELIAS-CLARKE HUMAN RESOURCES OFFICE -- DAY

ANDY sits across from SHERRY, 40's. On the wall are cover rom the Elias-Clarke magazines -- a news magazine, a cookin agazine, a fitness magazine... and Runway NDY is unloading clips from her horrible briefcase.
_ANDY
"This article was about the Take Back the Night march. This was a four-part series on the impact of busing on the public schools..."

SHERRY holds up her finger to stop ANDY talking.
_SHERRY
"I have two positions available. One is assistant to the road test editor of Auto Universe magazine."
_ANDY
(forces a smile)
"And the other one--?"

9 INT. RUNWAY RECEPTION AREA -- DAY

Sleek, elegant, hard-edged chic. Behind the reception desk i n elegant logo that says RUNWAY. ANDY walks over.
_ANDY
"Hi, I have an appointment with Emily Charlton--"
_EMILY (O.S.)
"Andrea Sachs?"
(EMILY (and MIRANDA, later) pronounce ANDREA Ahn-DRAY-a. AND efers to herself as AN-dree-a. NDY turns and sees a taller, thinner and, amazingly, mor roomed CLACKER. This is EMILY. She looks the part of th leek fashionista, but is propelled by a core of barel amped down anxiety. She examines ANDY.
_EMILY (CONT'D)
"Human Resources certainly has a bizarre sense of humor."
(sigh, annoyed)
"Follow me."

10 INT. RUNWAY HALLWAY -- DAY 10

EMILY briskly walks ANDY down the hall.
_EMILY
"Okay, so... I was Miranda's second assistant, but her first assistant recently got promoted so now I'm the first..."
ANDY glimpses an office in front of them, seductively bright.
_ANDY
"And you're replacing yourself."
(CONTINUED)

The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05

10 CONTINUED: 10

_EMILY
"I'm trying. Miranda sacked the last two girls after only a few weeks. We need to find someone who can survive here. Do you understand?"
_ANDY
"Yes. Of course. Who's Miranda?"
_EMILY
(eyes widening)
"You didn't just ask me that. She's the editor in chief of Runway. Not to mention a legend. Work a year for her and you can get a job at any magazine you want. A million girls would kill for this job."
_ANDY
"Sounds great. I'd love to be considered."
She smiles. EMILY tries to think how to break it to her.
_EMILY
"Andrea, Runway is a fashion magazine. An interest in fashion is crucial."
_ANDY
"What makes you think I'm not interested in fashion?"
EMILY gives her a look. ANDY smiles, like she has no ide hat EMILY could mean uddenly, EMILY'S Blackberry goes off. She gasps.
_EMILY
"Oh my God. No. No, no, no."
_ANDY
"What's wrong?"

11 EXT. ELIAS-CLARKE -- DAY

A black sedan pulls to a sudden stop outside the building.

_EMILY
(all but screaming)
"She's on her way -- tell everyone!"
Just then a dapper man of about 40 walks briskly by.
_NIGEL
"I thought she was coming in at"
_EMILY
"Her driver text-messaged. Her facialist ruptured a disk. God, these people!"
NIGEL turns and sees ANDY. Looks at EMILY. Who is that?
_EMILY (CONT'D)
"I can't even talk about it."
No time to discuss. NIGEL calls down the hallway.
_NIGEL
"All right, everyone. Man your battle stations!"
(beat, bewildered)
"Did somebody eat an onion bagel?"
Behind him, ANDY tries not to look guilty.

13 EXT. ELIAS-CLARKE -- DAY

The sedan door opens. We see only flashes of MIRANDA, wha he's wearing, not the complete picture yet.. ..Manolos, Chanel jacket, Van Cleef earrings...

14 INT. RUNWAY - BULLPEN -- DAY

ASSISTANTS frantically push clothing rails out of the way DITORS race into their office NDY peers in. One of the EDITORS changes from kitten heel o sky-high stilettos.. ..another pulls on a body shaper under her dress.. ..another hurriedly dumps the remains of her breakfast - ome cubes of cantaloupe -- into the trash...

15 INT. ELIAS-CLARKE LOBBY -- DAY

We watch MIRANDA walking through the lobby. We see PEOPL eact to her- UARDS, ASSISTANTS and SECRETARIES cower, DISTINGUISHE XECUTIVES bow their heads in respectful greeting IRANDA maintains a high rate of speed towards the elevator he gets in. The CLACKER inside immediately leaps out.
_CLACKER
"Sorry, Miranda."
MIRANDA doesn't acknowledge her existence.

16 INT. RUNWAY - BULLPEN -- DAY

EMILY races to the kitchen (right near their bullpen). Gets  lass, reaches into the fridge, pours a Pellegrino. Race nto MIRANDA'S office. Races back out. Grabs an armful o agazines and newspaper from her desk and runs back int IRANDA'S office.

17 INT. RUNWAY - RECEPTION AREA -- DAY

...MIRANDA steps out of the elevator and for the first tim e see her head-on IRANDA'S look is so distinctive you can spot her a mil way. She is unlike any other beautiful woman, singularl IRANDA.

18 INT. RUNWAY - BULLPEN -- DAY

EMILY types frantically into her computer, presses print tands by the printer waiting, takes the paper out of th rinter, puts it on a clipboard. Notices ANDY.
_EMILY
"Oh no. You're still here. Go."
ANDY gets up.
_EMILY (CONT'D)
"No, stay. I don't want you walking past her. Just sit there and I'll pray she doesn't notice you marring the area."
ANDY sits back down CONTINUED)

_ANDY
(to herself)
"Wow, this is like self-esteem camp."
The rest of the office continues its hubbub...

19 INT. RUNWAY - HALLWAY -- DAY

..until the moment MIRANDA enters the office from reception nstantly, a quiet falls. Everyone looks calm an rofessional. Or fakes it MILY, phony smile on her face, trots down the hall to wal IRANDA to her office.
_MIRANDA
"I don't understand why it's so difficult to confirm an appointment."
_EMILY
"I'm so sorry, Miranda. I did confirm last night, but--"
_MIRANDA
"The details of your incompetence do not interest me."
MIRANDA gestures impatiently. EMILY hands her the clipboard IRANDA peruses it as they walk down the hall.
_MIRANDA (CONT'D)
"Tell Simone I'm not approving the girl she sent in for the Brazil layout. I wanted clean, athletic, and smiling not dirty, tired and paunchy..."
EMILY follows her.
_MIRANDA (CONT'D)
"RSVP yes to the Michael Kors party -- the car will drop me at 9:30 and wait until I leave at 9:45... Tell Natalie at Glorious Foods for the fortieth time -- no, I don't want the tortes filled with warm rhubarb compote. I want the chopped almonds."
EMILY jots everything down CONTINUED)

_MIRANDA (CONT'D)
_Call my ex-husband and remind him the
_Parent-Teacher conferences at Dalton

 tell him to meet me for dinner at that
 place I went with Massimo...
_EMILY
_Right.
_MIRANDA
_And tell Richard I saw the pictures of
 for the feature on female paramedics
 and they're all so unattractive. I
 don't understand. How hard is it to
 find a decent-looking paramedic?...
_Also, I need to see what Nigel has
 called in for Gwyneth's second cover
 try...
MIRANDA stops at EMILY'S desk, takes off her coat, dumps i n EMILY'S desk, walks past ANDY, seeming not to notice her.
_MIRANDA (CONT'D)
_Who is that?
Damn. Did notice her. EMILY follows MIRANDA.

19A INT. RUNWAY - MIRANDA'S OFFICE 19A

_EMILY
_Nobody. Human resources sent her up
 about the assistant job and I was pre-
 interviewing her for you, but--
_MIRANDA
_I'll do it. The last two you sent me
 were total disappointments. Send her
 in.

19B INT. RUNWAY - BULLPEN -- DAY 19B

EMILY walks out of MIRANDA'S office. Points at ANDY.

_ANDY
"My name is Andy Sachs. I recently graduated from--"
_MIRANDA
"What are you doing here?"
_ANDY
"I think I could do a good job as your assistant and--"
MIRANDA gives her a look.
_ANDY (CONT'D)
(fast, blurting)
"I came to New York to be a journalist and I sent letters to everyone and I finally got a call from Elias-Clarke and met with Sherry in Human Resources and basically it's this or Auto Universe."
ANDY stops, can't quite believe she said that. MIRANDA take n this burst of honesty.

MIRANDA stares. ANDY abruptly stops talking. Heads for th oor. Then she stops and turns.
_ANDY (CONT'D)
"Okay, you're right. I don't fit in here. I'm not glamorous or skinny and I don't know much about fashion. But I'm smart, I learn fast and I will work very hard."
And... MIRANDA says nothing. Just then we hear a voice omeone heading into MIRANDA'S office.
_NIGEL

So until she decides you're not a psycho, I get the lovely task of waiting around for the Book."

Clearly, she has no idea what a run-through is.
_EMILY
(exasperated)
"The editors bring in options for a shoot and Miranda chooses. She chooses every single thing in every single issue. Run-throughs are a huge deal."
And indeed ANDY can see EDITORS running in and out of thei ffices, rack of clothes and accessories flying.
_ANDY
"Is it always like this?"
_EMILY
"No. Sometimes it's busy."

"Tough call. They're so different."
ANDY lets out a little giggle. And it's like she set off  renade. Slowly everyone turns to her.
_MIRANDA
"Is something funny?"
_ANDY
"No, no, no. It's just..."
And MIRANDA says nothing. ANDY twists in the wind.

_MIRANDA
"This... stuff? Okay. I understand. You think this has nothing to do with you. You go to your closet and select, say, that lumpy blue sweater because you're trying to tell the world that you take yourself too seriously to care about what's on your body. What you don't know is that your sweater is not blue. It's not even sky blue. It's cerulean. You also don't know that in 2002, De La Renta did a collection of cerulean gowns, Yves St. Laurent showed a cerulean military jacket, Dolce did skirts with cerulean beads, and in our September issue we did the definitive layout on the color. Cerulean quickly appeared in eight other major collections, then the secondary and department store lines and then trickled down to some lovely Casual Corner, where you no doubt stumbled on it."

_ANDY
"You should have seen the look she gave me. I thought the flesh was going to melt off her face."
NATE laughs.
_ANDY (CONT'D)
"It's not funny. She could be the most horrendous person I've ever met. She's not happy unless everyone around her is panicked, nauseous or suicidal. And all the Clackers just WORSHIP her..."
(off his confused look)
"They call them Clackers. Their stilettos in the marble lobby... clack, clack, clack..."
She pulls an ancient Northwestern sweatshirt over her head he starts eating the grilled cheese, gesturing angrily wit t as she talks.

_NATE
"Gimme that. There's about eight dollars worth of Jarlsberg in there."
He takes the sandwich, takes a bite.
_ANDY
"I just have to stick it out for one year. Then I can do what I came to New York to do. I can't let Miranda get to me. I won't."

You're working at the place that first published some of the major artists of the century -- Halston, De La Renta, Lagerfeld. And what they made is cooler than art, because you live your life in it -- I mean, not you, but some people. This is not just a magazine. It's a shining beacon of hope for, oh, I don't know, say a young boy growing up in Rhode Island with six brothers, pretending to go to soccer practice when he was actually at sewing class and reading Runway at night under the covers with a flashlight."
He picks up steam as he talks.

She reaches into her bag, hands out perfume, cosmetics. Etc.
_ANDY
"Here... A bunch of Kiehl's, some Mason Pearson hair brushes..."

_ANDY
"Thing is, it turns out there's a lot more to Runway than fancy purses... you know who's coming into the office Friday? John Updike."
_NATE
"Why, does he need a sweater?"
They all laugh. ANDY plucks the current issue of Runway ou f her purse.
_ANDY
(a bit peeved)
"Look, there's a piece by Jay McInerney, an essay by Joan Didion, an interview with Christiane Amanpour oh..."
_NATE
"Look who's drinking the KoolAid."
She gives him a look. Just then ANDY'S cell phone rings IRANDA. NATE grabs it.

_JAMES (CONT'D)
"Open-woven leather, pieced by hand and finished with a suede trim. Who made this fantastic thing?"
_ANDY
"You."
_JAMES
"Duh."
He hands her a folio with a handle.
_JAMES (CONT'D)
"It's a sketch of Miranda's dress for the benefit, the centerpiece of my spring collection. Top secret stuff."
ANDY takes the folio.
_ANDY
"I'll guard it with my life."
_JAMES
"Come on. You work for Miranda, you must be in desperate need of hard liquor."
He walks her to the bar. She tries not to stare at the part UESTS... is that Lenny Kravitz? Is that Julian Schnabel?
_JAMES (CONT'D)
(to the BARTENDER)
"She'll have the punch."
(hands her the punch)
"It's deadly. Have fun!"
And he walks away. ANDY clutches the glass of punch.
_CHRISTIAN

_ANDY
"God, I love it when total strangers tell me how I feel."
_CHRISTIAN
"That's my way."
(extends his hand)
"Christian Thompson."
_ANDY
"Christian Thompson? You're kidding. You write for every magazine I love. I actually reviewed your collection of essays for my college paper."
_CHRISTIAN
"Did you mention my good looks and killer charm?"
_ANDY
"No, but I did point out some factual errors and a penchant for confessional semi-fiction that borders on self-indulgent."
_CHRISTIAN
"You and the Times."
(laughs)
"And what do you do?"
_ANDY
"Well, I want to work somewhere like the New Yorker or Vanity Fair. I'm also a writer, but--"
_CHRISTIAN
"Is that right? I should read your stuff. Send it over."
_ANDY
"Thank you. That would be great. Anyway, for now I'm Miranda Priestly's assistant."

"Excuse me?"
_CHRISTIAN
"You're smart, you're nice, you have a point of view. You can't do that job."
ANDY hands him her glass of punch.
_ANDY
"I have to go."
She starts to leave.
_CHRISTIAN
"Let me guess. You have a boyfriend waiting. From... not high school... college? Nice-looking guy, devoted, about to ask you to move in with him, but you're not sure..."
She stares at him. Appalled. And, you know, intrigued.
_ANDY
"You. Are not a nice person."
_CHRISTIAN
"Nice to meet you, Miranda girl."
He walks away. Steam practically pours out of her ears.
_ANDY
"For your information, he's really handsome. And we already live together!"
This doesn't cause him to turn around, though it does cause  ew other people to stare. ANDY walks away, embarrassed.

_ANDY
"Okay, look, I'm sorry about that--"
He gives her a kiss.
_NATE
"I'll see you later, okay?"
Just then NATE'S cell phone rings. NATE picks up.
_NATE (CONT'D)
"Hello?"

_MIRANDA)
"Sure, Doug! I'll get on it ASAP! A six- pack? No problem. Budweiser or Michelob? Chilled? Of course..."

NIGEL looks surprised.
_NIGEL
_They're not expecting us until

 decision-making, then we brushed each
 other's hair and gabbed about American
_Idol.
_NIGEL
_I see your point.

76 EXT. STREET -- DAY

MIRANDA and ANDY ride along in heavy traffic. MIRANDA i apping her foot, impatient.
_ANDY (O.S.)
_What's a preview, anyway?
_NIGEL (O.S.)
_Miranda insists on seeing all the
 designer's collections before they
 show them.
_ANDY (O.S.)
_And she tells them what she thinks?
_NIGEL (O.S.)
_In her way. There's a scale. One nod,
 good. More than one nod -- very good.
_There is only one actual smile on
 record -- Tom Ford, 2001. If she
 doesn't like it, she shakes her head.

80 INT. JAMES HOLT'S LOFT -- DAY 80

MIRANDA walks in the elevator. ANDY hesitates, unsure i he's permitted to be in the elevator with her. Okay, fine.

_ANDY
_Last time I was here, James was having
 this cool party and--
(off MIRANDA's look)
 --and this is why you don't like
 people riding up in the elevator with
 you.
MIRANDA smiles a tight little smile. Precisely.

MIRANDA diligently kisses both of his cheeks.
_JAMES (CONT'D)
"You got the sketches for your dress."
_MIRANDA
"Yes. I did."
Beat. And she conspicuously does not say she liked them.
_MIRANDA (CONT'D)
"Thank you."
And her tone is very remote. And now we can see JAMES reall tart to quake IRANDA arranges herself on the Mies daybed, legs folded amrod straight. The other RUNWAY editors -- NIGEL, JOCELY nd LUCIA and their assistants, stand behind MIRANDA AMES and his people stand off to the side as a few fi ODELS begin walking out in various outfits.
_JAMES
"This season I started to think about the intersection of East and West..."
No one in the room watches anything except -- MIRANDA' eaction s JAMES speaks, we dissolve from outfit to outfit. JAMES i rying desperately to impress MIRANDA. He's practically tap ancing.
_JAMES (CONT'D)
"I didn't want to do, say, a blonde in a kimono. It's more about capturing the Eastern sensibility in the Western woman. Kind of Uma Thurman in Kill Bill in a kick ass dress with an obi belt. The modern woman as Geisha meets rock star, with a little Desperate Housewives thrown in."
Suddenly, there's a glimpse of movement from Miranda -- coul t be a nod? Everyone holds their breath o, she's just straightening her glasses.
_JAMES (CONT'D)
"And this, of course, is the dress we're making for you."
(CONTINUED)

The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05

An overly busy red dress with too many fashion ideas bein ttempted at one time.
_JAMES (CONT'D)
"A lush Asian fabric, tailored, but with a bit of movement to work against the modernism."
And suddenly, there it is, the kiss of death. The dreade ursing of the lips.

84 EXT. STREET -- DAY

The Runway team files out, MIRANDA first. ANDY and NIGEL wal ogether.
_ANDY
(sotto voce)
"She pursed her lips and because of that he's going to change his entire collection?"
_NIGEL
"You still don't get it, do you? Her opinion is the only one that matters."
MIRANDA, about to get into the town car, turns to ANDY.
_MIRANDA
"Make sure you confirm my dinner with--"
_ANDY
"--Galliano at Pastis. Done."
_MIRANDA
"And I need to see the look book for the November denim shoot."
_ANDY
"It's in the car."

CLOSE O  key, as EMILY hands it to ANDY.
_EMILY
"Guard this with your life."

"Of course. If I can deliver the Book, that means I must have done something right, that she doesn't think I'm psycho. Oh, and she actually called me Andrea instead of Emily. Isn't that great?"
_EMILY

ANDY steps inside, her footsteps echoing through the foyer.

"And leave the Book on the table with the flowers."
ANDY looks. There are one, two, three tables... all i ifferent areas of the house. She looks very confused.
_ANDY
"Shit."
Suddenly she hears a noise. She looks up and sees two girl f about 12, CASSIDY and CAROLINE, peering down th taircase.
_CASSIDY
"It's that door. On the left."
ANDY hangs the dry cleaning. The girls call down.
_CAROLINE
"You can give us the Book."
_CASSIDY
"We'll give it to her."
ANDY shakes her head. No no no.
_CAROLINE
"It's okay. Come on up."
_ANDY
"But I can't... Shh..."
_CASSIDY
"It's okay."
And ANDY, unsure what to do, starts to walk up the stairs he gets about halfway up when she hears voices.. IRANDA and her husband, STEPHEN are in the dining room,  liver of which is visible from the foyer.

_STEPHEN
 ...and I knew what everyone in the
"restaurant was thinking. There he is, waiting for HER again--"
And as he says this he stops, curious. There on the stairs ead peeking into the second floor, is ANDY, frozen ith the TWINS smiling at her nd before ANDY can stop herself, her eyes float over t TEPHEN'S. Eye contact. Her heart does a flip. And her eye art over to MIRANDA and they make eye contact as well.. .. and MIRANDA gives ANDY a look of utter coldness, disgus nd judgement. ANDY freezes.

ANDY closes the door to the townhouse, heart pounding.

97 INT. ANDY & NATE'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT

ANDY crawls into bed next to NATE, heart racing, and looks u t the ceiling, freaking out.

98 INT. RUNWAY - BULLPEN -- DAY

ANDY walks in, already bracing herself, and runs into EMILY merging from MIRANDA'S office, very upset.
_ANDY
"Okay, before you start freaking out, it wasn't such a big deal. The twins said hello, I said hello back, then I went upstairs and gave the book to Miranda--"
_EMILY
"You went upstairs? Oh my God. Why didn't you just climb into bed with her and ask for a bedtime story?"

"Wait a second. She's going to fire me?"
_EMILY

ANDY looks at her. Really?
_EMILY (CONT'D)
_When Miranda gives someone an
 impossible task, it generally means
 one of two things. One, she thinks you
 can actually pull it off.

_Emily, I have to talk to you.

_I freaked out of course, but then I
 just called Martine at home and she

EMILY juggles an Hermes bag, her purse, her cell phone lmost mows down an OLD LADY. She mouths "Sorry."
_ANDY
_Okay. Emily. When you get in, I want
 to talk to you about something--
_EMILY

 problem--

 you or beat you with a red hot poker,

 she is.
_EMILY
_Oh, please. That's a pathetic excuse.
Just then an ORDERLY walks in with her dinner, laden wit attening foods -- a cream soup, bread, pasta, cheese an essert MILY grabs a pudding, peels off the foil top.
_EMILY (CONT'D)
_What gets me about this whole thing
 is, you're the one who pretends you
 don't care about this stuff. You don't
 care about fashion, you just want to
 be a journalist, blah, blah, blah.
_What a load of bollocks.
She angrily finishes the last spoon of pudding, grabs  inner roll, which she starts to butter.
_ANDY
_Look, I know you're mad. And I don't
 blame you.
_EMILY
_Face it, Andy. You sold your soul the

She bites off a hunk of dinner roll...
_EMILY (CONT'D)
(with her mouth full)
_And you know what really kills me? The

_ANDY
"Actually..."
Stop smiling. Why am I smiling?
_ANDY (cont'd) (CONT'D)
"I am going--"

"That's great. I'm staying at a fantastic little hotel in the Seventh across the street from a falafel restaurant that will change your life."

"Sorry. I'll be too busy working. You'll have to find someone else's life to change."
_CHRISTIAN
"But that's just it. I'm starting to wonder if I can."

_ANDY
_Miranda asked me and I couldn't say
 no, okay? I didn't have a choice.
_NATE
_I know, I know. That's your answer for
 everything lately. I didn't have a
 choice. Like this job was forced on
 you. Like you don't make these
 decisions yourself...
_ANDY
_Okay. I get it, you're mad because I
 work late all the time, because I
 missed your birthday party--
_NATE
_Oh, come on. What am I, four?
_ANDY
_You hate Runway. And Miranda. You
 think fashion is stupid. You've made
 that clear.
_NATE
_Andy, I make port wine reductions all
 day. I'm not exactly in the Peace
_Corps. I wouldn't care if you were out
 all night pole dancing if you did it
 with some integrity.
_ANDY
_So now I have no integrity. Great.
_NATE
_You used to say this was just a job.
_You made fun of the Runway girls. And
 now you've become one of them.
_ANDY
_That's absurd.

 you're willing to change to be

CHRISTIAN bursts into laughter.

_MIRANDA (CONT'D)

 for Jacqueline, one she would accept.
_Turned out, that James Holt job is so
 absurdly overpaid--

_MIRANDA
_I must say, I was impressed with you,
 how intently you tried to warn me.
ANDY looks at her, stunned that she knows.
_MIRANDA (CONT'D)
_I never thought I would say this,
_Andrea, but I see some of myself in
 you. Your dedication, your focus.
MIRANDA looks out the window. They're approaching the nex arty and the paparazzi are waiting outside...
_MIRANDA (CONT'D)
_People think success happens to you.
_It doesn't. You choose it. Every day,
_I choose excellence. Who else does
 what I do, at my level? Nobody. They
 don't even understand what it takes,
 the days, measured in milliseconds...
ANDY stares at her.
_MIRANDA (CONT'D)
_But now you know --and I know -- that
 you have it in you. That you can see
 beyond what other people want and
 choose for yourself.
She smiles, like she's just given ANDY an enormou ompliment. ANDY reels.
_ANDY
_But I don't think I am like that.
MIRANDA looks at her. Oh?
_ANDY (CONT'D)
_I couldn't do what you did to Nigel,
_Miranda. There's no way I could do
 something like that.
Pause. ANDY can barely believe what she said. But instead o xploding... MIRANDA smiles.

_MIRANDA
_No. You did choose. You chose to get
 ahead. You want this life, those
 choices are necessary.
_ANDY
_But what if it's not what I want? I
 mean, what if I don't want to live the
 way you do?
MIRANDA looks at her and smiles, and this time, for the firs ime, her smile is almost maternal.
_MIRANDA
_Don't be silly, Andrea. This is what
 everyone wants. Everyone wants to be
 us.
And with that she opens the door to the limo...
