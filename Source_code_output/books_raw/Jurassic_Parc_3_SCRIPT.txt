1 EXT. PACIFIC OCEAN – DAY

A speedboat cuts swiftly through the ocean swells beneath th ooming cliffs of ISLA SORNA.

2 EXT. BOAT - DAY

Illegal Costa Rican parasail operator ENRIQUE CARDOSO help mericans BEN HILDEBRAND and twelve-year-old ERIC KIRVY - lready wearing life-vests -- strap themselves into a two erson PARASAIL HARNESS.

3 EXT. BOAT - DAY

Ben and Eric clamber onto a makeshift PLATFORM that hangs ove he back of the board. Dangling from Ben's neck is a CAMCORDER.
_BEN
"You make sure to get us as close as you can, okay? If it's a good trip, I'll give you a  little extra. "
_ENRIQUE
"Don't worry. I take you close. But not too  close."
(rubbing Eric's head)
"You don't want them to eat you."
Enrique heads toward the driver's seat and a large SECOND-HAN INCH bolted to the deck.
_ENRIQUE (CONT'D)
"Ready, amigos?"
Ben and Eric nod excitedly and give the thumbs up. Ben lifts th amcorder to the record the action nrique jams the down the throttle down, and with a loud RAOR, th peedboat shoots forward. Soon the boat is whipping across the olling ocean trapped together, Ben and Eric lean back over the passin ater, intently watching for Enrique's signal s the boat picks up speed, Enrique eyes the speedometer en grabs the end of the RIPCORD attached to the harness. He an ric braces themselves nrique finally signals with a pulling motion. He pull he winch, Ben yanks the cord and - OOOSH! A brightly colored PARASAIL blossoms behind the boat oisting Ben and Eric aloft. In a big BLOCK LETTERS on th arasail is stitched "DINO-SOAR. HE TOWNLINE unsold rapidly from its enormous reel EN AND ERIC climb higher and higher NRIQUE keeps an eye on the clients. When they reach a certain eight, he LOCKS OFF the reel igh overhead, Ben and Eric are floating in wonderful, quie plendor. The motor of the boat now sounds strangely distant own below, the boat enters a think blanket of FOG ric points excitedly at the islands as Ben films him with th amera hen, a sudden TUG on the thing line cause Ben to drop the camera hich now dangles from his neck.
_ERIC
"What was that?"
A second tug...and now the faintest of screams en and Eric look down to find that the boat has disappeare nto the low bank of FOG y the time the boat emerges on the far side of the mist...THEI S NO SIGN OF ENRIQUE. The deck is splattered with blood s Ben considers the driverless boat...
_ERIC (CONT'D)
"Ben!"
Ben glances over at Eric, staring in horror at something elow. Following his gaze, Ben finds that their boat is onl oments away from crashing into A LARGE REEF ticking out of the water, the imposing reef is being battere y waves S THE BOAT SMASHES INTO THE REEF, it splinters into  umber of pieces  panicked Ben turns to Eric.
_BEN
"Unclip your line!"
Eric and Ben frantically unclip their lines. Catching a pdraft, the parasailers float upward  strong wind sends them wafting over the daunting cliff f ISLA SORNA...

4 EXT. SUBURBAN BACKYARD - DAY

TWO PLASTIC DINOSAURS enter the frame and do battle accompanie y a child's ferocious sounds.
_CHILD (O.S.)
"RRRRROW! GRRRRRR!"
WINDER TO REVEAL  HARLIE, a three-year old boy, plays in a sandbox with hi avorite toy dinosaurs. ALAN GRANT squats next to him an atches with great delight LLIE SATLER stands over them, an INFANT in her arms --  icture of the perfect family.
_GRANT
"Oh, actually, Charlie, those two are herbivores. They wouldn't be interested in fighting each other. But these..."
(picking up two other dinosaurs)
"See, these are carnivores. And this one here -- see its claws -- this one here uses its claws to gouge at the throat of its opponent…"
As Grant demonstrates with some GRUNT and GROANS of hi wn, he only succeeds in frightening the boy.
_ELLIE
(interrupting)
"Uh, Alan?"
_GRANT
"Hmm?"
_ELLIE
"He's three. Why don't you wait till he's a little older?"
_GRANT
"Oh, right."
(back to Charlie)
"Happy dinosaurs."
He bounces them along the sandbox edge hen, the sound of a CAR ENGINE turning off and a doo LAMMING is heard.
_ELLIE
"That must be Mark."
(calling out)
"Mark, we’re back here!"
Ellie and Grant turn to see - ARK DEGLER coming through the gate carrying a briefcase. He's their age, handsome but not annoyingly so, with a friendly alance demeanor e and Ellie kiss tenderly on the lips.
_ELLIE (CONT'D)
"Good day?"
_MARK
"Keeping the world safe."
(re: baby)
"Here, let me take her."
Ellie hands off the baby.
_ELLIE
"Mark, this is Alan Grant."
_MARK
"Nice to meet you, Alan. I've heard a lot about you."
The two men shake hands, and we now realize it is Gran ho is the stranger in this household. Little Charlie runs t is father, showing his dinosaur.
_CHARLIE
"Daddy, this is a herbabore."
Grant smiles uncomfortably, a third wheel.

5 INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

WINDEN to a PARROT in a large cage. Grant is teasing he bird with a cookie, holding a it just out of reach.
_GRANT
"What's my name? Come on, Jack, say it. Is my name Alan? Say my name. The bird doesn't respond."
_GRANT (CONT'D)
"He used to know me."
_ELLIE
"Sorry, Alan it's been six years."
Grant shrugs, gives Jack the cookie, and heads towards the table he three adults are finishing their dessert and coffee. Th he children have been out to bed n awkward moment of silence. Uncomfortable smiles. Then --
_MARK
"More coffee?"
_ELLIE
(relived)
"Yes. Great."
Mark stands and collects their cups.
_ELLIE (CONT'D)
"So, Mark's working at the State Department now."
_GRANT
"Really? "
(To Mark hat do you do there?
_MARK
(with mock bravado)
"I could tell you about it, but than I'd have to kill you."
_GRANT
"Indeed."
Mark smiles, nodding. Then he goes into the kitchen. Anothe ncomfortable silence.
_ELLIE
So what are you working on now?
_GRANT
We have a new site in Montana. At least unti he money runs out.
_ELLIE
"Anything good?"
_GRANT
"Raptors, mostly."
_ELLIE
"My favorite."
Grant leans forward, realizing Ellie's one of the few people h an talk to about this.
_GRANT
"You remember the sounds they made?"
_ELLIE
"I try not to."
_GRANT
"We've done cranial scans, and raptors actually had a quite sophisticated resonating chamber. I have a theory that their ability to vocalize is the key to their social intelligence. The way they can work together as a team."
_ELLIE
"You think they could talk to each other?"
_GRANT
"To a degree we never imagined."
And from the cage in the corner of the room...
_JACK
"Bullshit!"
Both look back at the parrot. ELLIE smiles.
_ELLIE
"You taught him that."

6 EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - NIGHT

Ellie and Grant head toward the rental car parked in th riveway.
_ELLIE
"Good luck with the fund raising."
_GRANT
"It was never easy, but before Jurassic Park, you could find money. Somewhere. Now fossils are out. Everyone wants to see a real live dinosaur."
_ELLIE
"Times change Alan. But you're the still the best. I mean that."
_GRANT
"The last of my breed."
A long moment passes between them as both consider wher hey've ended up.
_GRANT (CONT'D)
"I'd better get going."
_ELLIE
"Let me know if I can help, Alan. You’re bad about asking for help, but please ask me. Anything, anytime."
_GRANT
(deep down knowing he never
 will)
"Okay. Goodbye, Ellie."
_ELLIE
"Goodbye, Alan."
Not sure what the right thing to do is, they finally end up wit  friendly hug. They keep it short rant gets in his car. Starts the ENGINE e's about to pull off when Ellie knocks on the window. He roll t down.
_ELLIE (CONT'D)
"When I met you, I thought that one day millions of years ago, all the dinosaurs became extinct. Wiped out. But you told me otherwise. When conditions changed, dinosaurs changed. They became other things. They evolved."
_GRANT
"A well-accepted theory."
_ELLIE
(simply)
"Alan don't be afraid to evolve."
Grant hears her, but Ellie knows it didn't really get through  forced half-smile, than Grant waves goodbye llie watches as he drives off.

7 INT. AUDITORIUM - DAY

The last stop on Grant's fund-raising tour, it's a publi ecture hosted by some foundation. There are SCIENTISTS an TUDENTS here, but also a lot of DINO-FANS, some even wit ostumes rant finishes his speech to what was a full house -- som TTENDEES are grabbing their coats and sneaking out. Thi asn't the exciting guest speaker they were all expecting  new slide comes up. Just black and white, and indecipherable.
_GRANT
"It's through the painstaking study of the Interior chamber in multiple specimens that we can determine this exciting correlation between the larynx and the upper plate. That lets us theorize -- theorize, mind you -- that the raptor might have been capable of bird- like vocalizations. Which as you can imagine, would be a tremendous breakthrough."
He's finished, but no one seems to notice at first. Then th YMPOSTUM LEADER stands up, leading a smattering round o PPLAUSE.
_SYMPOSTIUM LEADER
"Thank you very much Dr. Grant. Now does anyone have a question?"
Nearly every hand goes up. Grant doesn't seem surprised.
_GRANT
"Does anyone have a question that doesn't  relate to Jurassic Park?"
Quite a few hands go down.
_GRANT (cont'd)
"Or the incident in San Diego, which I'll remind you, I did not witness."
Now most of the hands are down. Picking one of the fe emaining...
_MALE STUDENT
"Your theory on raptors is good and all, but isn't all this conjecture kind of moot?"
The STUDENT'S BUDDY nods in agreement.
_MALE STUDENT (CONT'D)
"I mean, once the U.N. and Costa Rica and everyone decides how to handle the second island, scientist will just go in and look for themselves."
_TOO-CLEVER SCIENCE REPORTER
"Isn't paleontology itself in danger of extinction?"
Recognizing those as fighting words, the symposium leader i bout to step in. But Grant will take this himself.
_GRANT
"No, and let me be perfectly clear on this point. Dinosaurs lived"
million years ago What's left of them is fossilized in stone the actual scientists spend years to undercover."
(MORE)
_GRANT (CONT'D)
"what John Hammond and InGen created are theme park monsters. Nothing more, nothing less. The class clearly disagrees with his assessment."
_ANOTHER STUDENT
"You're saying you wouldn't want to study them if you had the chance?"
_GRANT
"No force on this earth or in heaven could get me on that island."

8 INT. DERELICT COCKPIT - DAY

Looking through the cracked windshield of a junkyard plane, w ee someone spray painting red circles on the outside of th lass.

9 EXT. AIRCRAFT GRAVEYARD - DAY

NASH, a wry, intelligent mercenary pilot and soldier, i ainting huge eyes the windows of a wrecked plane. Finished, h osses the paint can through the open windows and walks quickl way from the plane e now see that RED TEETH are painted on the craft's nose. I ooks absurdly like some angry beast e are one the edge of a dry lake bed, part of an aircraf raveyard. Wrecked planes lie all around e hear a phone RINGING...

10 INT. CARGO PLANE - DAY 10

A RINGING satellite phone rests on a stack of gun cases DESKY, the leader of this crew, answers it. 
_UDESKY
"Udesky."
(beat)
"Yes sir. we're good to go. I'll lock it down as soon as you drop me the payment."
With the phone still to his ear, Udesky wanders out of th raft...

11 EXT. CARGO PLANE - DAY

Udesky looks over at Nash and COOPER, another mercenary ooper's the quiet muscle of the bunch, a weapons specialist. H inishes loading a massive gun, essentially a hand-cannon. It' imed at Nash's grimacing aircraft.
_UDESKY
"That's right, two of the very best I could find. No, I haven't worked with them personally, but they come with the highest recommendations."
Then - ooper FIRES at the grimacing aircraft. A projectile rocket nto the plane and EXPLODES with a fireball ash and Cooper exchange a satisfied smile.
_UDESKY (CONT'D)
"You've got nothing to worry about, sir. This is going to be a piece of cake."
Pieces of the demolished craft come raining down.

12 EXT. EXCAVATION BASE CAMP, PT. PECK LAKE, MT - DAY

CLOSE ON a man's hand, carefully scraping the stone away from  inosaur fossil. We follow his hand back as he wipes off hi weaty brow, revealing him to be BILLY BRENNAN, 25, a ssociate professor and site manager. He's a charmer ooking past him, we see CHERYL, 21, a junior at junior of State. She's on f a dozen COLLEGE STUDENTS working at the site, and the on ost smitten with her supervisor.
_CHERYL
"Billy? I don't think I'm doing this right."
He scoots over, lying down beside her. Checks her work.
_BILLY
"You need to go slowly. See, just take it little at a time."
She's not listening, just watching his eyelashes.
_CHERYL
"I can never tell what's bone and what's rock."
_BILLY
"Technically, it's all rock. The calcium in the bones is replaced during fossilization. But you can feel the difference. See? Rough, smooth. Rough, smooth."
He runs her bare fingers over the two different patches, showin er. After a pause, she runs her finger along hi tubbly chin...
_CHERYL
"Rough."
...and along his lips.
_CHERYL (cont'd)
"Smooth."
Billy may not have started this flirtation, but he's not endin t either. It's then that  HADO alls across them. Billy looks up to see...
_BILLY
"Dr. Grant!"
Grant has just returned, a bag over his shoulder.
_GRANT
"Mr. Brennan."
_CUT TO:

12A EXT. WALKING TO THE MAIN TENTS - DAY 12A

Billy takes one of Grant's bags, talking as they go.
_BILLY
"How was your trip? Profitable?"
_GRANT
"We'll be broke in four weeks."
_BILLY
"Three weeks. I had to rent some equipment."
The cross into one of the tents, which only has two "walls". O  dust-taped table, a dusty Macintosh is feeing data into  trange machine the size of a dorm refrigerator. A mechanical arm sweep ack and forth across a tray of fine sand.
_GRANT
"You rented an automated litter box."
_BILLY
"It's a rapid prototyper. I feed in the scan data from the raptor skull, than the computer breaks it into thousands of slices which this thing prints, one layer on top of the other. It's the future of paleontology."
_GRANT
"Not if it can't dig."
The arm stops and suddenly the tray of sand shakes, droppin hrough holes in the bottom to reveal an object the size of  person's fist.
_BILLY
"I give you a raptor's resonating chamber."
Grant hates technology, but he can't help but be amazed by th esult. He lifts the strange object up, shaking out th emaining sand illy puts it to his lips and blows through it like a conch shell he resulting SOUND is unique and piercing, the cry of an on-existent animal. Grant is speechless with excitement. And so h ses it again and again, producing different SOUNDS an ariations n the distance, flocks of birds rise to the sky and fly off illy looks up to see a MAN and a WOMAN getting out of  Cadillac. Cheryl is pointing them in the direction of the ent. 
_BILLY (cont'd) 
(falsely casual) 
"Oh, I forgot to tell you. Some visitors  wanted to come by and talk to you. I "
told them you'd be happy to see them. 
"maybe even have dinner with them. "
_GRANT 
"Absolutely not. "
_BILLY 
"They're here. "
_GRANT 
"What? "
Only now does Grant realize these two peopl ho were walking up to them utting on a friendly smile, Billy goes up to them. 
_MAN 
"Dr. Grant? "
_GRANT 
"Yes? "
_MAN 
(extending his hand) 
"Paul Kirby. Kirby Enterprises "
(reaching into his pocket) 
"My card. "
PAUL KIRBY is a talkative optimist with o "off" switch. His wife AMANDA KIRBY, jus s friendly, is harder to read. There seems to be xhaustion behind her eyes. 
_GRANT 
"What can I do for you, Mr. Kirby? "
_PAUL 
"Well sir, I am a great admirer"
of yours, and I have an extremely interesting roposition to discuss. Would you let my wife nd I take you to have dinner tonight? Our treat. 
_GRANT 
"You know, I've been traveling and I'm very  tired. Maybe some other time. "
_PAUL
"I guarantee it'll be worth your while."
Behind Kirby, Bill furtively rubs his thumb and finger ogether, indicating the guy is loaded rant musters a weak smile.
_GRANT
"It's be my pleasure."

13 INT. HELL CREEK BAR AND GRILL, JORDAN, MT - NIGHT

They’re only halfway through the entree, but Grant is ready t olt. It's only Billy who's keeping him from being rude. They wal ver to Paul and Amanda’s table and sit down.
_PAUL
"First off let me say as a dinosaur enthusiasts, Amanda and I have admired your work for years."
_AMANDA
"It is truly, what’s the word? Inspiring."
_GRANT
"Thank you."
It's everything Grant can do just to be polite. He desperatel ants to leave and get back to his dig.
_PAUL
"Amanda and I, well, we just love the outdoors. Heck we've been on pretty much any adventure tour they can come up with: Galapagos, K2, the Nile..."
_AMANDA
"We even have two seats reserved aboard the first commercial moon flight."
Billy nudges Grant.
_GRANT
"Hmmm."
_PAUL
"Now, for our wedding anniversary this year we wanted to do something really special, something..."
He places his hand on his wife's.
_AMANDA
 ...once-in-a-lifetime.
_PAUL
"We've arranged for a private airplane to take us flying over Isla Sorna. And we want you to be our guide."
The Kirby's look to Grant as if they've offered him an amazin ift. But Grant just sighs and smooths the tablecloth.
_GRANT
"That's a very nice offer, Mr. Kirby, but I'm afraid I'm much to busy. If you like I can refer you to a number of highly qualified..."
_PAUL
"No, no, see Dr. Grant, you're the best. You've seen these animals in the flesh. No one else has come close to you."
_GRANT
"I'm flattered, but I've taken this little adventure tour. And with the air restrictions they've imposed after the incident in San Diego, you can’t fly low enough to see anything of interest."
Paul is momentarily stymied, but Amanda rallies.
_AMANDA
"You see, that's just the thing. Paul and I have special permission to fly low."
_BILLY
"How low?"
_PAUL
"Well, I'm no aviation specialist. But I do know it's hell of a lot lower than anyone else."
_AMANDA
"From what I understand, it's pretty much whatever we want."
_GRANT
"That's hard to believe."
_PAUL
"Let's just say that through my business -- imports/exports, emerging markets -- I've made some friends in high places. In this case, the Costa Rican government."
_AMANDA
"Dr. Grant, you don't know how important it is for us to have you come along. It would make all the difference."
Grant is trying to find another way to say no, when Paul pull ut his checkbook.
_PUAL
"And of course, we're prepared to make a sizeable contribution to your research here."
Billy looks at Grant. Don't say no.
_PAUL (cont'd)
"I can write all kinds of numbers on this check. Just tell me what exactly it would take."
We HOLD ON a conflicted Dr. Alan Grant.
_CUT TO:

14 EXT. SKY - DAY

NNNNNRRRRRRNNNNNRRRRR..  SMALL AIRPLANE - a Beechcraft Kingair 200 Turboprop, to b xact - cruises through clear blue skies.

15 INT. PLANE - DAY

Grant re-settles, trying to get comfortable. Billy is acros rom him, finishing cleaning his camera lenses before puttin hem back in the ragged case.
_GRANT
"Even with what I pay you, you could get a better bag."
_BILLY
"No way. This is lucky. Couple years ago some buddies and I went hang gliding off these cliffs in New Zealand. Updraft sent me right into the side. BOOM!"
_GRANT
"That does sound lucky."
_BILLY
"It was this strap alone that saved my life. Got caught on a rock as I was falling."
_GRANT
"Reverse-Darwinism. Survival of the most idiotic."
Because he hasn't really said it...
_BILLY
"Listen Alan, I really appreciate you bringing me along."
_GRANT
"The bones will be there when we get back. That's the nice thing about them. They never run away."
(beat)
"And besides, you got me into this. I don't intend to be alone with these people."
ON PAUL AND AMAND itting near the front of the plane. Paul draws a long, nervou reath and looks at Amanda. She seems just as tense inally finding a comfortable position, Grant puts his hat ove is eyes, ready to take a nap one with his camera, Billy turns to someone just off screen.
_BILLY
"So how do you know the Kirby's?"
and we reveal.. ercenary Cooper, the weapons specialist we met earlier. He' earing sunglasses so dark you can't tell whether he's starin t you or fast asleep e doesn't answer. Did he even hear? And then --
_COOPER
"Through our church."
_BILLY
"What Religion?"
_COOPER
"Uh…the one that worships God and believes in being Good. "

16 EXT. SKY - DAY

The plane continues onward.

17 INT. PLANE - DAY / HOURS LATER

Grant slowly wakes in his chair, groggy. All the othe assengers are fast asleep. Then Grant turns to his right  RAPTO its besides him. The dinosaur eyes him curiously, then open is mouth...
_RAPTOR
"Alan."
And than it STRIKES.

18 INT. PLANE - DAY

Grant wakes up with a start, disoriented. Billy is leaning ove im.
_BILLY
Alan. We're almost there he adrenaline still surging through him, Grant turns and look HROUGH THE WINDOW louds obscure the view, than parts revea SLA SORN ising majestically out of the water.

19 EXT. SKY - COUNTINUOUS DAY

We watch the plane descend sharply to the island.

20 INT. PLANE - COUNTINUOUS DAY 20

In various combinations, Grant and Billy, Paul and Amanda loo ut the windows at the amazingly green island ooper looks out through a window of his own.

21 INT. COCKPIT - COUNTINUOUS DAY

Here we find the rest of the crew from the junkyard. Nash i iloting  VOICE comes over their radio headsets.
_RADIO VOICE
(Spanish accent)
"Unidentified aircraft approaching Isla Sorna, this is San Juan approach. You are flying in restricted airspace. Immediately turn to the coordinates two-zero-zero. I repeat redirect to..."
A look from Nash then Udesky switches off the radio.

22 EXT. PLANE - COUNTINUOUS DAY

The plane now descends to a mere hundred feet above th reetops.

23 INT. PLANE - CONTINUOUS DAY

Paul puts his hand atop Amanda's as they stare intently out th indow illy looks to Grant.
_BILLY
"Admit it. You're excited."
Grant will admit nothing alling back from the cockpit...
_UDESKY
"Cooper! Yell up if you see anything!"
_COOPER
(yelling back)
"No, I thought I'd keep it to myself."
Suddenly Grant spots...
_GRANT
"There. There! An Apatosaur. Look at the coloration."
EXT. ISLA SORNA – GRASSY FIELD – CONTINUOUS DA n Apatosaur is grazing on the grass NT. PLANE – CONTINUOUS DAY
_BILLY
(amazed)
"I'm so use to seeing bones. It's weird to see skin."
_GRANT
"Mr. and Mrs. Kirby! If you look out the right you can see..."
But Paul just waves him away with a hand, staring intently ou is window. We HOLD ON Grant a moment, thinking that odd.

24 INT. COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS DAY

Udesky puts down his binoculars.
_UDESKY
"South shore is clear. The rest is rock."
_NASH
"Are we on?"
_UDESKY
"We're on."

25 INT. MAIN CABIN - CONTINUOUS DAY

Looking out the window, Grant notices they're flying awfull ow. Just then, he hears a MECHANICAL HUM and a LOW RUSH fro utside. Now wanting to believe --
_GRANT
"That's not the landing gear?"
Paul, Amanda and Cooper don't respond.
_GRANT (CONT'D)
"What you're..."
(realizing)
"You can't land."
Paul turns back to him.
_PAUL
"Dr. Grant if you'd just sit tight, we'll explain this all in a jiffy."
_GRANT
"This plane can not land!"
_AMANDA
"It's going to be all right. Just..."
Grant is out of his seat, heading for the cockpit. He'll wrestl he controls if he has to ooper grabs him, pulling him back. Grant starts to struggle ut he's certainly no match. A well-practiced fist hits hi ead on UT TO BLACK.

26 OVER THE DARKNESS

we hear Amanda's voice, strangely distant but amplified.
_AMANDA
"Eric! Eric! Are you there honey? Ben! Erriccc!"
Her calls continue as we FADE UP to...

27 INT. PLANE - DAY

GRANT'S P.O.V. -- blurry and disorientated. He finds himself lyin n the floor of the plane eeing him come to, Billy helps him slowly get up. Grant's hea s pounding.
_GRANT
"Tell me we didn't land."
By his expression, we see Billy would have to lie.
_BILLY
"I think they're looking for someone."

28 EXT. LANDING STRIP, ISLA SORNA - DAY

The jungle has almost reclaimed this patchy vine-covere unway. The airplane is parked at one end ash, Udesky, and Cooper are checking their weapons manda is at the edge of the tarmac calling into the jungle on  ULLHORN illy and a groggy Grant emerge from the airplane. Paul trot ver.
_PAUL
"Dr. Grant, are you alright? I'm sorry we had to be so..."
The three mercenaries are now walking into the jungle wit heir guns.
_GRANT
"What the hell is going on? What are they doing?"
_PAUL
"Establishing a perimeter. Making it safe. These guys are really good. One of them was a Green..."
_GRANT
"Mr. Kirby, trust me, on this island, there is no such thing as safe. We have to get back in this plane..."
Grant looks to Amanda, who shouts through a bull horn.
_AMANDA
(on-bullhorn)
"ERRR-IIIC!"
_GRANT
"And tell your wife to stop making so much noise! We're food to these damn "
animals.
_PAUL
(yelling)
"Amanda, Honey! Dr. Grant says it's a bad idea!"
_AMANDA
(on the bullhorn)
"What?"
_PAUL
(pointing broadly at Alan)
"He says it's a bad idea!"
_AMANDA
(on the bullhorn)
"What's a bad idea?"
As in on cue, there is a DEAFENING ROAR from the jungle veryone turns toward the sound and freezes.
_PAUL
(to Alan)
"What was that?"
Grant doesn't answer, still listening to the reverberations. hen a couple shots are heard.
_BILLY
(low)
"Is it a rex?"
_GRANT
"I don't think so."
Billy and Paul breathe a small sign of relief.
_GRANT (CONT'D)
"Sounds bigger."
Nash and Udesky come RUNNING out of the jungle, headed fo he plane.
_UDESKY
"We gotta go, now!"
_PAUL
"What's the problem? Can't you guys...?"
As Udesky and Nash sprint past Paul in interrupted by  econd, closer, DEAFENING ROAR. He pales.

29 INT. PLANE - CONTINUOUS - DAY

Udesky waits by the door, hustling everyone inside. Nas urries into the cockpit. Everyone scrambles to a seat. Amand limbs next to Paul.
_AMANDA
"We can't just..."
_PAUL
"Don't worry, honey. We'll circle around and come back."
Udesky closes the door.
_BILLY
"What about the other guy?"
_UDESKY
"Coop's a professional. He can handle himself."
A blood-curdling SCREAM echoes through the jungle followed b ACHINE GUN FIRE.
_NASH
(yelling back)
"We're going!"
Udesky climbs into the copilot's seat, and Nash revs the engine.

30 EXT. RUNAWAY - DAY 30

The plane starts down the runway.

31 INT. PLANE - DAY

The passengers bounce in their seats as the plane picks u peed down the overgrown strip.

32 EXT. RUNWAY - DAY

Suddenly, two hundred yards ahead of the plane OOPE merges from the jungle. He stands in the middle of the runway aving one arm wildly. His second, badly injured arm hang imp by his side.
_COOPER
"Come on, Nash. Slow down, buddy."

33 INT. THE COCKPIT - DAY

Nash spots Cooper, shoots a glance at the airspeed indicator.
_NASH
"Coop, you know I can't do it pal."
He slams down full throttle in an attempt to reach flying speed eeing that Nash has no intention of stopping, Paul shouts fro he cabin.
_PAUL
"What are you doing? That's Mr. Cooper!"

34 EXT. RUNWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

We are looking down on Cooper from behind. As the plan pproaches  SHADO alls over the injured mercenary. Then with brutal speed, a NORMOUS BEAST seizes him in its massive jaws and lifts hi nto the air rom this angle we get only a glimpse of a long crocodilia nout, powerful clawed forearms and spiny sail rising from th reature's back.

35 INT. THE COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS - DAY

_BILLY
"Is anyone hurt?"
Checking themselves, everyone seems pretty much intact till thinking of himself as in charge...
_UDESKY
"Quiet! We're okay. Let's everybody just stay put."
He attempts to turn on the cockpit radio, but it's dead.
_NASH

"What is it? What's the matter?"
Amanda SCREAMS  huge reptilian face appears in the cockpit window. Everyon lse SCREAMS now.

The plane LURCHES - and we hear a deep GROWL.

The passengers hold tight, paralyzed. Nash buckles himself int is seat uddenly, the plane is YANKED from the side to side. Battered thi ay and that, the terrified passengers tightly grip their eats.

Finally, the horrible sounds of WRENCHING METAL as the nose o he plane is RIPPED RIGHT OFF ash and Udesky are suddenly sitting in open air. The nose o he plane is tilting downwards, the jungle floor far below he passengers hang almost vertically in their seats ebris tumbles out the open end of the plane, some of i triking Nash in the head desky unbuckles his seat belt and climbs back up into th abin. Nash follows uddenly, a long snout with dagger-like teeth pushes past th ockpit seats, opens wide, an LAMPS DOW n Nash's legs he pilot CRIES OUT in agony. The others passengers grab ont is arms, trying to pull him back. But it's no use. The dinosau ips Nash out of their grasp and down the aisle ash desperately grabs on to the seat cushion, then watches i orror as the fabric RIPS AWAY. He's pulled out of the plane and ropped to the ground. A giant foot steps in the way as the snou f the creature reaches down and quickly devourers the screamin ilot t's horrifying sight, but no one can turn away leased with the appetizer, the creature comes back for th ain course rant tries to force open the jammed rear door.

The plane comes to an abrupt halt as it SMASHES into a tree  gargantuan FOOT steps on the fuselage and FLATTENS it like a aper tube.

42 INT. PLANE - CONTINUOUS - DAY

Inside, windows EXPLODE, raining glass over the passengers. A he walls compress, Udesky becomes trapped in the rear of the lane, the others in front.
_BILLY
"Over here!"
Udesky dives into the narrowing gap, and Billy pulls him th est of the way through illy is as terrified as the rest of them, but he thrives unde his rush of adrenaline.

Then a huge CLAW digs into the skin of the fuselage and begin o slowly PEEL the plane open. Grant looks up in dread at th idening tear.
_GRANT
"This way!"
Grant leads the group out the open end of the cockpit. The ake a mad dash for the jungle  tremendous ROAR causes Billy to look behind him. He can' elp but steal a glimpse of this terrifying, but utterl ascinating, animal rant yanks him forward.

43 EXT. JUNGLE - DAY

With Grant in the lead, and Udesky taking up the rear, the grou ears through the jungle oncealed by the dense undergrowth, the unseen dinosaur bear own on them -- mowing down the young trees which TOPPLE al round them rant spots a grove o EAVIER TREE nd leads the group into it he dinosaur cannot fit between the trunks. It ROARS a he fleeing humans, searching desperately for a route afte hem he group continues their relentless pace, putting as much istance as they can between themselves and the beast.

Our friends stop dead in their tracks. Amanda stifles a cry efore them lies an immense unmoving SAUROPOD.
_GRANT
"Don't worry. It's dead."
Then a full-grown bul YRANNOSAURU ises up behind the carcass. It was feeding, its mouth mottle ith blood and carrion rant FREEZES.
_GRANT (CONT'D)
"Nobody move a muscle."
Remember: the T-Rex tracks motion beying, the group FREEZES for a few long beats. Then Udesk akes off running nd T-Rex ROARS veryone runs. T-Rex is right behind them.

45 EXT. JUNGLE - DAY

Dashing back the way they came, the group suddenly comes fac o face with - HE FIRST MONSTER e now get our first full unobstructed view of the giganti reature, SPINOSAURUS AEGYPTICUS. Over forty feet long an wenty-five feet high, the dinosaur has a bony sail along it ack. Its head is crocodilian with rows of long, curving teeth inewy six foot arms terminate in three fingers hands wit ourteen inch claws owhere else to run, the group scatters into the brush as th wo behemoth predators rush forward, their ROARS thunderous aul and Amanda scramble into one direction, Billy and Udesky i he other. But Grant can't go anywhere - his foot is stuck etween two branches e manages to free himself as the two dinosaurs approach hey'll have to deal with each other before eating the humans rant dives down between two fallen trees as the Spinosaurus and T ex circle one another like gladiators, each searching for th ther's weakness aying flat on his back, Grant lets out a terrified GASP as th iant foot of Spinosaurus lands across the two trunks mer nches from his face pinosaurus lunges forward, powerful jaw open wide -Rex sidesteps the assault, its tail knocking down smal rees as it spins out of the way n the tress, Paul and Amanda scurry again for cover etween the fallen trunks, Grant attempts to get away on hi ands and knees -Rex presses the attack, slamming its tail into the flank o ts adversary.

_GRANT
"Come on!"
Spinosaurus lets out a victorious HOWL, and the blood-drenche rofessor leads the group through the undergrowth.

46 EXT. JUNGLE - DAY

Winded from running, Paul is caught off-guard as a furiou rant slams his back against a tree. Only one thing he wants t now --
_GRANT
"Why did you bring us here?"
Paul is too startled to speak. Udesky tires to step in, bu rant gives him back a look.
_AMANDA
"Our son is on this island. We need your help to find him."
Still crunched against the tree, Paul pulls out a photo from hi hirt pocket.
_PAUL
"This is him. Eric. He’s thirteen now. He's just about the greatest kid in the world."
Letting go of Paul, Grant takes the photo, a Sears-styl ortrait of the boy we saw Parasailing at the beginning. H hakes his head, disbelieving. He hands the photo to Billy he group splits into two sides -- Paul and Amanda, Grant an illy -- with Udesky stuck between. Dialogue overlaps i laces.
_AMANDA
"He's with a man named Ben Hildebrand."
_BILLY
"Who's that?"
_PAUL
"Her new boyfriend."
_AMANDA
"A friend. We were vacationing. Eric wanted to see the island and the dinosaurs, so Ben found a guy who would take them parasailing. They never came back."
_PAUL
"We called everyone, did everything we could. Because of all the controversy over this island, no one will step in. Costa Rica says it's a no-fly zone, it's their own damn fault. Guys at the U.S Embassy -- our U.S. Embassy -- said we should "accept the inevitable." You believe that?"
_GRANT
"So you hired these mercenaries."
_UDESKY
"We prefer "recovery specialists." We do overseas custody issues and..."
_GRANT
(interrupting)
"Then you duped us into coming here."
_PAUL
"We needed somebody who knew the lay of the land. Somebody who'd been to this island before."
_GRANT
(disbelieving)
"I have never been on this island!"
_PAUL
"Sure you have. You wrote that book..."
_BILLY
"That was Isla Nublar. This is Isla Sorna. The second island."
_PAUL
(low, to Udesky)
"I didn't know, there were two islands."
_AMANDA
"Still, you have survived the dinosaurs before. You saved those kids."
_GRANT
"A few of us survived. A lot more died. And we were better prepared and better armed."
(finally)
"How many days have they been missing?"
A look between Amanda and Paul.
_PAUL
"Eight weeks."
Grand and Billy are speechless. It might as well be eight years.
_GRANT
"After what you've seen today, you really think your son could be alive?"
_AMANDA
"He's smart, Dr. Grant. And he knows so much about dinosaurs."
Before anyone else can talk, Grant puts his hand out. He want veryone to shut up while he plans their next move.
_GRANT
"No, I'm sorry, but no. We'll savage what we can from the plane. Then we head for the coast. There may be a boat left, something to get us off this island."
_PAUL
"Dr. Grant, we're not leaving without our son."
_GRANT
"You can stick with us, or you can go and look for him. Either way you're probably not getting out of here alive."
With that he leaves, A beat later, Billy follows. He ha enuine sympathy for the Kirby's, but he's logical enough t now Grant is right ACK WITH PAUL AND AMAND hey look to Udesky.
_PAUL
"What do we do?"
Udesky is clearly at a loss, but for everyone's reassurance h ries to mutter some brio.
_UDESKY
"Well, I think we should start searching for your"
son. In the direction they're going.
_PAUL
"Excellent."
They follow after Grant and Billy.

47 EXT. PLANE CRASH SITE

The five survivors search through the wreckage, trying to fin nything useful. The task is grim. Mindful of Grant's arnings, they move quickly and quietly desky picks up a gun out of the swampy water. The barrel is ben lmost 90 degrees, unless illy finds his camera, intact igging a change of clothes out of his suitcase, Paul step round the side of the plane to change. He's in his underwea efore he notices Amanda is also there changing.
_PAUL
"Sorry."
_AMANDA
"Nothing you haven't seen before."
A beat. Amanda looks over as they get dressed.
_AMANDA (CONT'D)
"How much weight have you lost?"
_PAUL
"Twenty, twenty-fire pounds. I've been swimming at the Y."
_AMANDA
"You hate to swim."
_PAUL
"People change."
A nod to mean, that's the truth.
_PAUL (CONT'D)
"You look good."
_AMANDA
"So do you."
They make brief eye contact, which Amanda breaks round the side, Billy is taking photos of a giant footprint th inosaur left in the mud during its attack on the plane. Gran ooks over.
_GRANT
"How would you classify it?"
_BILLY
"Obviously a superpredator."
(best guess)
"Suchimimus. that snout."
_GRANT
"They never got that big."
_BILLY
"Baryonyx?"
_GRANT
"Not with that sail."
(Billy gives up)
"Spinosaurus Aegypticus."
_BILLY
"I don't remember that on InGen's list."
_GRANT
"That's because it wasn't on their list. Who knows what else they were up to?"
Billy looks past Grant to see Paul approaching. He's strugglin ith the straps on his backpack. turning in circles illy regards him with suspicion.
_BILLY
"So Mr. Kirby, tell me, when you climbed K2, did you base camp at 25- or 30,000 feet?"
_PAUL
"Thirty-thousand, I think. Closer to the top."
_BILLY
"About a thousand feet above it, actually."
(closer)
"Most mountain-climbers remember how tall that mountains were."
Paul knows he's caught.
_GRANT
"There is no Kirby Enterprises, is there?"
_PAUL
"There is. I own a place called Kirby Paint and Title Plus. We're out in the Westgate Shopping Center in Enid, Oklahoma. The"
 "plus" is for bathroom fixtures, fireplaces
"accessories, patio furniture. Stuff like  that."
_BILLY
"I don't suppose that check you wrote us is any good."
_UDESKY
"He paid us half up front. Cash."
_PAUL
"Mortgaged everything we had to do it. Even the store. and if we make it off this island with my son, I swear, I'll make good on the money I owe you. I don't care if it takes me the rest of my life."
Grant and Udesky exchange a dubious glance.
_UDESKY
"However long that is."

48 EXT. JUNGLE PATH - DAY

Amanda, Paul, Billy, Udesky and Grant walk through the jungle.
_AMANDA
"Eric!"
_GRANT
"Quiet!"
_PAUL
(loud whisper to Amanda)
"Stop that. Dr. Grant says this is dangerous territory."
_AMANDA
"Well we should split up or something. We can cover twice the area."
_PAUL
"No, Dr. Grant says..."
_AMANDA
"Dr. Grant says this, Dr. Grant says that..."
_PAUL
"Well what's the use of hiring an expert if your not going to listen to him?"
_AMANDA
"Because "Dr. Grant" isn't looking for Eric. Dr. Grant is looking for the coast."
_PAUL
"Fine...and when the Tricyclatops comes after you, don't come crying to me."
_AMANDA
"Oh, don't worry about that."
_PAUL
"What?"
_AMANDA
"Nothing."
_PAUL
"What did you say?"
_AMANDA
"Nothing."
_PAUL
"What did you say!"
_AMANDA
"Just drop it Paul!"
The Kirby's conversation trails off into the jungle. Udesk oves up next to Grant and Billy.
_UDESKY
"If they split up, I'm going with you."
And as they continue forward, Billy spots something in th rees ahead.

49 EXT. JUNGLE CLEARING - DAY

A parasail chute is caught in the branches of a tree. A yello ife vest hangs limply from a branch aul rushes over, unsnags it, and examines the label.
_PAUL
"Young adult."
_AMANDA
"Eric..."
_UDESKY (O.S)
"Hey. Got something here."
All turn to see Udesky holding up a camcorder encased in  aterproof shell.
_AMANDA
"That's Ben's!"
She grabs it from Udesky and pops open the housing. She trie he power switch on the camcorder, but the battery's dead desky pull out a flashlight from his pack and looks to Amanda.
_UDESKY
"Here, give that to me."
And as Udesky fiddles with the flashlight, Grant and Bill onsider the parasail.
_BILLY
"It looks intact."
_GRANT
"We should take it with us to signal any planes."
_UDESKY (O.S)
"I think I've got it."
Udesky has rigged the wires on the flashlight so that th atteries can be used to power the camcorder e brings a live wire to back of the camcorder. A red powe ight comes on.
_AMANDA
"It works!"
_UDESKY
"I don't know for how long."
Udesky swings the tiny screen out and pushes play. The other rowd around N THE SCREEE ric and Ben play frisbee on the beach.
_PAUL (O.S.)
(excited)
"That's him. That’s Eric!"
_AMANDA (O.S.)
"I filmed this the morning they left."
Ben catches the frisbee, checks his watch and motions to Eric ric runs over, and Ben puts his arm around him as they run t he camera aul reacts to this image but holds his tongue HE VIDEO SCREEN  he image now CUTS to a shot from aboard Enrique's boa peeding towards ISLA SORNA -- the start of the movie. Eri oints excitedly at the island and smiles at the camera e replay the opening moments of the movie from Ben and Eric' erspective, soaring high until...
_ERIC
"Ben!"
_BEN
"Unclip the line!"
THE JUNGLE   PAN from face to face of all watching this tape with  ixture of hope and nausea N SCREEN  ngle again with Ben's legs in the foreground. Falling fast.
_BEN (CONT'D)
"Hand on! Hang on buddy!"
Now the camera penetrates the jungle canopy and the pictur nd sound become complete chaos: SCREAMS from the both ranches BREAKING, flashes of Ben and Eric's frightened face s the camera is buffeted in all directions ith a lurch the terrifying descent in finally over, and th ungle floor is just ten feet away, swaying back and fort eneath Ben and Eric's feet.
_BEN (CONT'D)
"Are you ok, buddy?"
There's GURGLING to his voice. Ben may be more hurt than he' etting on.
_ERIC
(through his sobs)
"I don't know. I think so."
_BEN
"We're okay. It's going to be okay. Here, get ready. I'm going to unhook you."
The sound of PUMPLING is followed by the sight of Eric DROPPING nto the frame, landing on the ground rolling. He stands an ooks back up at Ben.
_ERIC
"I'm all right"
_BEN (O.S)
(weaker)
"We're going to get out of this, pal."
And on that, the power and picture fade away ACK ON PAUL AND AMANDA - overjoyed.
_PAUL
"See? He's okay. He's alive! Everything's going to be all right now."
Amanda brings a hand to her mouth, silently nodding her head rant and Billy exchange a dubious look, than begin pulling th arasail out of the tree. As they do so, the sail gets caught o  branch hey pull harder. The branch bends, but the sail won't com oose. One last tug and than, SNAP. The branch breaks, the chut alls away to reveal  SKELETON t swings down directly at Amanda. She SCREAMS inally, the others are able to pull her away. As they untangl he lines, the men are able to get the first view of the remain f Ben Hillenbrand, still caught in his harness manda's knees buckle. Regaining her balance, she runs off int he jungle aul quickly follows.
_PAUL (CONT'D)
"Amanda!"

50 EXT. THICKNESS - DAY 50

Reeling, Amanda comes to a stop in an area with thic ndergrowth. It's danger here, very still and quiet he tries to calm herself, but each effort to suppress jus akes her more emotional. She's surprised as Paul wraps an ar round her to comfort her. But she doesn't fight it.
_PAUL
"I'm sorry Amanda. I am. And I'm sorry for the things I said about him."
_AMANDA
"No, it's..."
_PAUL
"I know you liked Ben. I had no right to..."
_AMANDA
(frustrated)
"It’s not about him. It's Eric. He's alone out here somewhere. Our baby is all alone."
Saying it aloud, the reality sinks in for both of them
_AMANDA (CONT'D)
"I guess I was hoping that with Ben around, there'd be someone to keep him safe."
Checking in on clients, Udesky stops at the edge of th hicket. Something raises the hairs on the back of his neck.
_UDESKY
"Dr. Grant!"
He nods for the others to take a look at this. They head over rant at the rear s he approaches, Billy is packing up the rest of the chute in  ackpack. He stops short from what he sees ooking down, we CIRCLE across the jungle floor. Here we find  trange, hollowed-out construction made of sod and branches aybe six feet around ust now noticing the others' stare, Paul looks down into on f the bowls at his feet, a half-buried nest. It's filled wit ootball-sized eggs, laid in a spiral nd this isn't the only nest. Amanda counts twelve in all, lai ut in an oddly symmetrical pattern he last to arrive, Grant identifies the species in a horrifie nstant.
_GRANT
"Raptors."
And as he says the words, off in the distance, we hea he cry of some herbivores, around by the chorus o narls.
_SMASH CUT TO:

51 EXT. FUTHER IN THE FOREST - DAY

The party blasts through the forest, trying to keep up wit rant. They haven't even had time to ask --
_AMANDA
(to Paul)
"What’s a raptor?"
Paul has no idea.
_UDESKY
"They don't look that big. I mean, comparatively."
_GRANT
"If we came across one, we might live."
_PAUL
"Well that's good."
_GRANT
"But you never came across just one."
From the back --
_AMANDA
"Wait! Where's Billy?"
They all stop. The only one not there is --
_Grant
"Billy! Billy!"
_AMANDA
(almost sotto)
"I thought we weren't suppose to yell."
_BILLY (O.S)
"Here!"
He comes in from the left. Excited, he explains to Grant --
_BILLY (CONT'D)
"I got some great pictures of the nest. You know this proves raptors raised their young in colonies."
Furious with his student. Grant just keeps moving. There's n ime to stand around and argue.
_BILLY (CONT'D)
"This speaks to a larger social structure, the possibility of Darwinian altruism. It changes everything."
A beat. Trying not to sound presumptuous --
_BILLY (CONT'D)
"We could co-write a paper."
_GRANT
"Ah yes, the first rule of academics. Publish or perish."

53 EXT. RIDGE - DAY (HOURS LATER)

Much fatigued, the five now mach upward towards a crest anting and flushed, they reach the top of the ridge and gaz nto the distance  jungle valley stretches before them. Not far off in A VAS OMPOUND - comprised of several buildings. One building alon eems to cover several acres he weary group breathes a sigh of relief.
_PAUL
"I bet there's a very good chance Eric's in there. I'd bet my bottom dollar."
Udesky and Grant share dubious looks and continue down int he valley.

54 EXT. INGEN COMPOUND - DAY

The group emerges from the jungles and enters the compound hey walk through an overgrown parking lot, littered wit bandoned vehicles. Some are lying on their side. Others ar verturned completely hey're not going to be driving anywhere  troubled Grant peers through a windshield, partially cave n, like some giant head butted the glass. (Think back to Lost orld nd the group finally approaches the front doors of a normous building. As they head up the front steps, we se omething in the distance behind them AT-LIKE MOVEMENT n the high ridge. To fast to see what it was. But too ominou o dismiss.

55 INT. BUILDING LOBBY - DAY

Our friends now find themselves in a sparse, one quietl pulent corporate lobby now in the process of being reclaime y the jungle/ Roots and ivy poke through the floor and walls n the waiting area, the cushions of a sofas and chairs have bee nawed at and pulled apart. Dusty coffee mugs and fille shtrays lie on the table. The water has turned brackish in  ear by cooler udden FLAPPING. We look up and see BIRDS nesting in th afters. It is an eerie, haunted place.
_PAUL
(calling out)
"Eric! Are you here?"
_AMANDA
"Eric!"
All listen for a response. Nothing. Paul and Amanda exchange  espondent look itting on the reception counter is an official-lookin elephone. Everyone has the same thought, but no one dares inally -
_AMANDA (CONT'D)
"What the hell."
Amanda puts the receiver to her ear. Nada ith Grant in the lead, they head deeper into the building nseen by the group, a fleeting SHADOW flits across the lobby' irty windows with terrifying speed.

56 INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

A couple vending machines stand at the one end of this lon allway covered with vines aul notices them and pulls change from his pocket.
_PAUL
"Let's see. I've got about a dollar seventy- five. How about you guys?"
Billy SMASHES IN the window of one machine with his boot icking through the glass, he pulls out some candy bars an hips. He checks the expiration date. ONTINUED:
_BILLY
"Thank God for preservatives."
He tosses the food to the others aul now turns to his own vending machine and SMASHES it wit is heal. The glass refuses to break.

57 INT. HATCHING LABORATORY

Grant and Billy push through a set of doors to see

A CAVERNOUS HATCHING FACILIT illed with much of the same equipment we recognized from th irst island, although the sheer size of this place dwarfs an f the facilities seen previously s the group walks down the ramp and onto the floor, they begin t bsorb the incredible array of technology: enormous cryoni reezer, their plug pulled years ago; empty incubators; tank f formaldehyde with dinosaur fetuses and body parts achines with intricate tubing and wing arms stand besid onveyer belts cris crossing the room at different levels.
_AMANDA
"This is how you make dinosaurs?"
_GRANT
"This is how you play God."
Billy looks around the lab. He can't help but be impressed.
_BILLY
"Okay if I take pictures?"
Grant nods illy sets his lucky camera back down on the worktable. Two year rom now, astute observers of the DVD will not that Bill oesn't actually take his camera from the bag; he was carryin t because there wasn't any room inside illy pulls a new roll of film from the bag and zips it shut CROSS THE LA manda is passing a large cylindrical tanks with half-forme mbryos floating in formaldehyde -- genetic experiments gon wry. Finally she reache  GIGANTIC MANIFIED RAPTOR HEA loating in the one tank omething about this specimen catches Amanda’s attention. Sh ends forward, getting very close to the glass. She peers righ nto the eyes of the nightmarish creature. Then - N ACTUAL RAPTO unges at her form behind the tank. She SCREAMS ortunately the raptor can't get between the closely space anks. Amanda runs.
_PAUL
"Amanda!"
_GRANT
"Back out! Move!"
And as the group races through the lab the Raptors find  arger gap between the tanks.

58 INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

Paul leads the way, checking the door for possible escap outes or hiding places. Twenty feet behind HE RAPTO ounds a corner, bolting after them. Paul ducks in the closes oor.
_PAUL
"In here!"

59 INT. DINO KENNEL - CONTINUOUS - DAY

The group slams the door behind them and quickly takes in th oom here are several rows of oversized steel cages, apparentl sed for containing young dinosaurs. Many of the cage doors ar tanding open he group races down a lone aisle. Close behind, the rapto URSTS into the room, ROARS s the Raptor gains ground, Udesky and Billy run into one of th pen cages, SLAMMING the door behind them rant, Paul and Amanda duck into another. Before they ca wing the cage door shut behind them, however, the raptor SLAM nto it, driving the door into the cage hey are forced back against a chain-like wall, trapped in  mall triangle space by the advancing door. The angr aptor is now inches away through the cage door hen, suddenly, the raptor looks up. We follow its gaze. The to f their triangular enclose is wide open he eager raptor climbs up the chain-like door. Catching th ail of an idea, Amanda grabs the door and nods to the others.
_AMANDA
"Push!"
They push hard on the cage door, swinging it and the rapto ight through the opening of the cage ow the raptor is trapped in a small triangular space, the doo oing right to the ceiling manda slides the door's bolt through the chain like wall emporarily trapping the dinosaur he raptor struggles desperately, GRAWLING AND SNARLING, bu he cage door seems to be holding s everyone rushes back to the door he raptor begins to make a LOW, HAUNTING MOAN s the others head for the door, Grant lingers a step, listenin o the beast's simple melodic cry. It has the same tones a ame from the model resonating chamber.
_GRANT
"She's calling for help."

60 EXT. COMPOUND - DAY 60

The group exits the rear of the lab building and finds itself i  large equipment yard. The CALL of the raptor is still audibl s they head for the tree line ow they moan is ANSWERED from distant jungle quarters he responses quickly MULTIPLY. To the group's dismay, the oon find themselves virtually SURROUNDED by raptor CRIES bot istant and near rant looks around with amazement. It's vindication of hi heory on raptor communication, but it couldn't come at a wors ime esponding to the growls, a herd of grazing HADROSAURS suddenl lees across the open space. Then, in the distance behind th er  PACK OF RAPTOR merges from the jungles, coming their way.
_GRANT
"Head for the trees!"
From the lab building, the raptor we left imprisoned now BURST ut one of the doors and HOWLS to the pack -- the same cry w eard in the lab he raptor pack moves into the hunting formation. One ALPHA-MAL APTOR. slightly larger than the others, leads the charge up th iddle rant risks a looks back. But doesn't stop running.
_GRANT (cont'd)
"THIS WAY!"
In an effort to escape the oncoming raptors, Grant leads th roup right into the stampeding heard of hadrosaurs uddenly, all is chaos. Hadrosaurs race past, splitting up th roup etting the others get ahead of him, Grant looks back. Much t is dismay, the raptors are ignoring the hadrosaurs ndeed, the pack weaves its way through the herd -- the raptor nly want them n the chaos of the stampede, everyone loses sight of each other p ahead, Billy trips and falls. As he rolls the strap on hi amera bag breaks. He doesn't notice it's missing until he' lready back on his feet and running manda and Paul keep close to each other. Further back, Gran pots Billy's fallen camera back. He grabs it as he runs past ooking back, Billy sees that Grant now has his back...
_BILLY
"ALAN!"
_GRANT
"KEEP GOING!"
They lose sight of each other in the rush.

61-19 OMIT 61-69


69A EXT. EDGE OF THE JUNGLE - DAY 69A

As the hadrosaurs WHIP PAST, Paul and Amanda climb up into  ree. A raptor leaps at Paul, barely missing his leg rying to pull Paul up, Amanda nearly loses her balance. Thi ime, Paul catchers her illy climbs up a nearby tree of his own in sight of Paul and Amanda desky has nearly reached a tree of his own when he find imsel EADED OF y a raptor. He turns to the other way, but find HERE ARE MORE RAPTORS e picks up a fallen branch as these dinosaurs cautiousl pproach. Not more than a few feet away, the leader of the tri tops, peering at him desky swings hard, but the dinosaurs feints. From behind him nother raptor slashes at the back of his legs, severing hi uscles. Udesky CRIES OUT and drops to the ground N THE TREETOP aul, Amanda and Billy can hear him.
_PAUL
"Udesky."
_AMANDA
(Listening)
"He's this way."
From here, the thick branches overlap, forming a kind of
"second floor" above the ground. It's not easy, but you can move
from branch to branch, tree to tree N THE FLOO nable to walk, Udesky attempts to crawl away from the animals he effort clearly causes him great pain. Strangely, th aptors suddenly don't seem interested in him anymore ather, they're "talking" among themselves. Udesky is amazed t ind him self still alive uddenly, one of the raptors SLASHES at him again. But it' elicately not a mortal blow, just a very painful one. Udesk RIES OUT, louder this time N THE TREE earing the new cry, Paul, Amanda and Billy move faster, no inally seeing Udesky on the ground. He's face-down, barel oving but still MOANING he raptors are gone n the lead, Amanda starts to climb down. But Paul grabs her olds her back.
_PAUL
"It's not safe."
_AMANDA
"We have to help him."
_BILLY
"He's right. A predator wouldn't leave a kill wounded."
_AMANDA
"He's not a kill, he's still alive."
She breaks from Paul's grip and drops to the ground. She's onl  foot away from the tree whe LL FOUR RAPTOR ead out from their hiding places. They almost catch her a illy and Paul pull her back up on the lim he raptors stare up at them, angry their plan didn't work.
_PAUL
"They couldn’t climb up, so they were trying to get us to come down."
_BILLY
"They set a trap"
(amazed)
"They actually set a trap."
Bored with waiting, the raptors go back to finish off Udesky aking a meal out of it. Up in the branches, the survivors ar orrified and sickened hen, from the deep in the forest, a new RAPTOR CRY. The feastin aptors look up, listening, then suddenly run off into the dar ungle.
_PAUL
"Where's Grant?"

69B EXT. ELSEWHERE IN THE JUNGLE - DAY 69B

Climbing higher in a tree, Grant is just feet above a growin ack of raptors. He scales one branch, the next, finall eaching a perch that the dinosaurs can't jump to OOKING DOW he entire pack is now standing still, watching him. In th enter, the Alpha Male lets out a sort of BARK. Responding to th ry, the other raptors CALL BACK s terrified as he is, he can't help but be fascinated by thei ommunication. Like a hellish bird song, there's a rhythm to it  structure. They're clearly talking about something nder his breath, Grant is able to mimic its patterns.
_GRANT
"What does that mean? What are you saying?"
Of course they can't answer. They just keep using the same
"phrase."
Ready to ditch Billy's camera bag in order to climb higher - e's had to hold it by the strap -- Grant finds his hand covere ith a runny slime. He looks down at the camera bag, and that' he source. It's oozing out the bottom e unzips the bag to fin  BROKEN RAPTOR EG nside, the white and green yolk still dripping from the piece f the shell. There's another intact egg beside it his is what the raptors where chasing.
_GRANT (CONT'D)
"God damn you, Billy."
Ever the scientist, Dr. Grant tests a theory even in the face o anger: he holds up the intact egg so that the raptors can see it hey suddenly go crazy, howling the same phrase but LOUDER.
_GRANT (CONT'D)
"It means, "Give us the egg," doesn't it? "We want the egg.""
He gently drops the bag to the ground. Although the raptors ar nterested, pulling out the unbroken egg, they're still by no mean lacated. The song may have changed, but they still want Gran ead hey begin to jump at him, eventually, hopping up on eac ther’s backs. It's only a matter of time till they reach him rant moves to climb higher, but sees no branches he can reach nd than he hears the low CREAKING. A CRACK. The branch he' n is starting to give in e looks down at the face of his enemies, knowing he'll b heir next meal. And then  SMALL CANISTE ands at the base of the trees, immediately SPRAYING out a thic loud of oily fog. It's the first o IVE CANISTER hat land in the area, creating a thick cloud. It's not jus moke though something far more caustic s it hits the raptors they immediately recoil, those closes o the canisters SHRIEKING in pain. Tumbling in the dirt here may be a pheremonal element to the mist as well -- the eem panicked, disoriented ack mentality takes over, and after the first ten raptors tak ff running, so do the rest, some tripping over their fee lindly his may be dino-tear gas, but it's not good for humans either p in the tree, Grant's eyes immediately burn from the vapo e squints to see through the fog, where he spot  HUMAN SHAP t the edge of the smoke
_VOICE
"Come on! They'll be back!"
Grant half-climbs, half-falls out of the tree, rushing to ge hrough the heaviest of the smoke  SMALL DIRTY HAN rabs his, pulling him along.

69C EXT. JUNGLE - LATE DAY 69C

Eyes swollen from the gas. Grant stumbles, barely able to see a he other person pulls him along. It's only now we can identif is rescuer a RIC KIRBY he boy he was brought to rescue. A lot has changed in the las ight weeks. It's not just dirt and muck -- he's the filthies hild you've ever seen -- something primal has come out in him omething wild.

69D EXT. INGEN COMPOUND - TWILIGHT 69D

On the far side of the tipped over vehicle, Eric pulls open  atch -- his hiding place. The door opens part way ric motions for Grant to follow.

69E INT. INSIDE THE BUNKER - TWILIGHT 69E

Squeezing in sideways -- it's very tight fit -- Grant find imself in a space no bigger than the inside of a Datsun. lit b  small battery-powered lantern. This is where Eric has bee iding he minute Grant's inside, Eric goes back to work re-sealin he door. This 13-year old boy has become astonishingl fficient at staying alive.
_GRANT
"Eric..."
The boy holds up a hand. He listens for a moment. He doesn' ear anything outside.
_GRANT (CONT'D)
"Eric, your parents are both here."
_ERIC
"In Costa Rica?"
_GRANT
"On the island."
Eric truly can't believe it. He hoped to be rescued but...
_ERIC
"They'll never make it. I mean, they can't manage when the cable goes out."
_GRANT
"You'd be surprised what people can do when they have too."
Eric studies his guest, finally certain he recognizes him.
_ERIC
"You're Alan Grant, aren't you?"
(off surprised reaction)
"I read both of your books."
_GRANT
"Which one do you prefer?"
_ERIC
"The first one. Before you where on the island. You liked dinosaurs back then."
_GRANT
"Back then, they hadn't tried to eat me."
Grant takes a better look around Eric's tiny hideaway mpressed with what he's been able to scavenge. Among the man tems we see another smoke canister, some battery-powere anterns and lots of candy wrappers. This kid's been living o hocolate for weeks.
_ERIC
"When InGen cleared out, they left a lot of stuff behind."
_GRANT
"Any weapons, radios?"
Eric pulls up a long cattle prod to show Grant.
_ERIC
"Found this, but the battery's dead."
_GRANT
"It's a wonder you aren't. I'm amazed, Eric. I  barely lasted 30 hours. You lasted eight weeks."
The line catches Eric strangely. It's the first moment of tru motion we've seen him in.
_ERIC
"Is that all it's been? I thought it was longer."
_GRANT
(trying to be positive)
"The important thing is we both made it. That's something we have in common."
Eric rips into a candy bar. After a moment, he realizes h hould offer one to his guest as well rant takes it. A lone beat. Than, Grant just has to know...
_GRANT (CONT'D)
"Did you read Malcolm's book?"
_ERIC
"Yeah."
_GRANT
"What did you think?"
_ERIC
"I dunno. I mean, it was kind of preachy. Chaos-this, chaos-that. And like, to me, the guy seemed kind of high on himself."
Grant smiles.
_GRANT
"That's two things we have in common."

69F EXT. TREETOPS - NIGHT 69F

The trio is where we left them, perched up in the branches hey're far from safe, but nothing's after them for  hile n Billy's eyes, we can see a storm of guilt raging. But h asn't said anything. Won't say anything.
_AMANDA
"We can't just stop looking. Eric and Dr. Grant are out there somewhere."
_PAUL
"I want to find them too, but we can't do a bit of good right now. For every scary thing we saw in the daylight, I'll bet there ten times more of 'em at night."
(to Billy)
"Am I right?"
_BILLY
"I don’t know."
_PAUL
"I thought you were an expert."
_BILLY
"Dr. Grant was."
_AMANDA
"Well Dr. Grant isn't here, so we're going to have to figure out what to do ourselves."
Amanda is impressed by her own determinations. A long beat.
_AMANDA (cont'd)
"So what do we do?"
No one has the faintest clue.

69G EXT. DEEP IN THE FOREST - NIGHT 69G

VARIOUS SHOTS; The creatures of Isla Sorna walk past in th hadows, some looking up at the light in the trees uddenly, one of the creatures is attacked by another. We hea OLLING, SNARLING, HISSING, just seeing the outline of th ight. Just as fast as it began, the fight is over, the winne nakes on the loser.

69H EXT. TREETOPS - NIGHT (LATER) 69H

Everyone's moved to different branches, trying to settle in fo he night. Paul keeps looking over to the tearful Amanda, abou o say something. He finally does.
_PAUL
"I just want you know, Amanda. It's not your fault what happened."
Amanda looks over, not sure what his absolution.
_PAUL (cont'd)
"Eric has always been headstrong, and you throw Ben Hildebrand into the mix and well..."
_AMANDA
"Well what?"
_PAUL
"Well damn it. I don't speak ill of the dead. What I'm trying to say is, it’s was just a crazy accident. The exact same thing could have happened if he was with me. You can't go beating yourself up about it."
Realizing he's trying his best, Amanda can’t stay angry wit im.
_AMANDA
"This wouldn't happen if he was with you. I mean, you drive five miles below the speed limit. I totaled three cars in fives years."
_PAUL
"That one time was just the bumper."
_AMANDA
"He would have been, safe. Completely, entirely, suffocatingly safe."
(beat)
"I would have him to see more of the world than Enid, Oklahoma. I wanted to see more of the world than Enid, Oklahoma. And so yes, it's my fault that this happened. I'm sorry that you have to be here."
Really looking at her...
_PAUL
"I'm not sorry at all."

69I EXT. INGEN COMPOUND - DAY 69I

Morning on Isla Sorna. A low mist hangs tight to the fores loor as Eric seals up his hideaway for hopefully the last time hey start walking. Eric pulls something out of his pocket hows it off to Grant.
_ERIC
"Know what this is?"
_GRANT
(takes it)
"A raptor claw. I use to have one. A fossil."
_ERIC
"Mine's new."
Grant hands it back ric is becoming more and more a normal thirteen-year old boy here's an innocence to him that's coming back.
_GRANT
"How much of this island have you explored?"
_ERIC
"I stayed pretty close to the compound, Figured if anyone came to look for me, that's where they'd start."
_GRANT
"We need to head for the coast."
_ERIC
"Are you sure?"
_GRANT
"Why?"
_ERIC
"Closer you get to the water, the bigger things get."

69J EXT. JUNGLE - DAY 69J

Billy and Amanda wait for Paul as he comes out of the bushes iking up his shorts rying to take charge...
_BILLY
"We need to stick to the plan. Head for the coast."
_AMANDA
"What about Eric and Dr. Grant?"
_BILLY
"Going to the coast was Alan's idea. If he's alive, that’s where he's headed."
_AMANDA
"What about Eric?"
Billy represses his instinct to say Eric's dead.
_PAUL
(rationalizing)
"He's probably has a better chance by the coast as it is. Figures that all the big dinosaurs would live in the center of the island."
(to Billy)
"Right?"
_BILLY
"Sure."

69K EXT. JUNGLE - DAY 69K

As Grant and Eric walk, both stop, hearing a strange sound. Bu or a change, it's not an ominous one t's a human one  phone is RINGING, very faintly. Without a word to each other rant and Eric decide its coming from the right.

69L EXT. JUNGLE - CONTUNUOUS DAY 69L

Paul is picking the briars out of his socks as they hike isking tripping on every step. Then Amanda stops short. She' he first to hear it HE SAME RINGING fter a beat, everyone else can hear it too. And recongnitio inally lights on Paul's face...
_PAUL
"My phone."
Suddenly, Paul frantically searches his pockets as the other nxiously watch.
_AMANDA
"You had the phone the whole time?"
_BILLY
"Where is it?"
_PAUL
"I don't know. I don't have it with me."
_AMANDA
"When did you have it last?"
_PAUL
"I don't remember"
_AMANDA
"Think."
And Paul wracks his memory...
_PAUL
"The plane. I got a call on the plane, put it in my coat pocket, and..."
Bust suddenly, he stops, his face is lighting with an awfu ealization. Amanda couldn’t bear the wait...
_AMANDA
"What?...WHAT!?"
_PAUL
"I loaned it to Nash. He must have had it on him when he..."
The hideous implication of his words slowly sink in.

69M EXT. JUNGLE - DAY 69M

Still following the faint RINGING, Grant and Eric turn to fin  SAI oving through the low trees. We recognize it as the back of  pinosaurus. We might think it's any random spinosaurus xcept for the RINGING coming from somewhere inside it rant and Eric press back against a tree, keep perfectl till as they hear the THOOOOMB, THOOOOMB, THOOOMB of th reature's footsteps reverberating. It's tail RUSTKES agains he brush t's moving behind them, and it's close e hear the RINGING move from left to right as it passes. S ar, its has no idea they're there ooking across the clearing, Eric is startled to se AUL AND AMAND re no more than 20 yards away, also hiding. An involuntar eflex, Eric calls out...
_ERIC
"Mon! Dad!"
Grant immediately covers the boy’s mouth. But it's to late he dinosaur has stopped. We still can't see it. We don't know ho lose it is aul and Amanda spot Eric with Grant. They're a thousan motions at once: relieved, disbelieving, terrified, overjoyed hey want to run to him, to yell out to him, but the monster i lose rant takes his hand off Eric's mouth. They both sta ompletely silent ll this time, the sat-phone is RINGING han it stops nd after an agonizing beat, the beast moves. At first we'r ot sure which direction it's headed, but finally we can tel ts moving away nce the sail is finally out of sight, Eric breaks from Grant' old and dashes to his parents' arms. They coop him up. Hu im, kiss him, their affection unquenchable. He's crying.
_AMANDA
(reassuring him)
"Sweetheart, you're okay."
(reassuring herself)
"You're okay."
(disbelieving)
"You're okay."
_PAUL
"Never had a doubt. Never did. Us Kirby men, we stick around, huh?"
_ERIC
"We do."
Looking at her grubby son, Amanda licks her shirttail, tryin o rub his face clean.
_PAUL
"Honey, there's not enough spit in the world for that."
She LAUGHS. It's the first times she's laughed in two months illy crosses the distance to Grant.
_GRANT
"We need to keep moving."
_BILLY
"Alan, I want to tell you that I'm so sorry about the..."
_GRANT
"Billy, I can't talk to you now."
He walks off. Billy follows him.
_BILLY
"Please, okay? Just yell at me. Call me an idiot. An asshole. Stupid. Tell me I screwed up because I know I did."
Grant doesn't respond.
_BILLY (CONT'D)
"I thought if we could get a raptor back to the mainland, we could get serious money for it. Enough to fund the digging for 10 years. More. Whatever it took."
Grant shakes his head, disgusted, But doesn't stop.
_BILLY (CONT'D)
"You have to believe me. I did it with the best intentions."
_GRANT
(finally turning on him)
"Some of the worst things imaginable have been done with the best intentions. You rushed in with no thought to the consequences, to yourself or anyone else."
(finally)
"You're no better than the people who built this place."
Grant keeps walking, leaving Billy with his guilt.

70 INT. CANYON BUILDING - DAY 70

The group enters a structure with giant windows designed t ook into the canyon beyond -- only there's nothing to see but  hick fog oward the center of the room, a spiral staircase that leads t  lower level ith Billy lagging, Grant approaches the stairs and peers dow he circular opening in the floor. There is not much to see, jus og, a glint of sunlight.

71 EXT. RIVER CANYON - DAY

Step by step, Grant leads the group down a rusty spira taircase below the observation room. The stairs end in a lowe evel. Although we're technically outside, this whole place fee trangely enclosed here's a thick fog at this level -- clouds, really -- but fa elow we can see the river. And at its banks, a barge.
_GRANT
"We climb down to the barge and follow the river out to the ocean. With any luck, the Costa Rican coast guard will pick us up."
_ERIC
"Then we go home?"
_AMANDA
"Then we go home."
Grant leads everyone down a RAMP to --

72 EXT. LANDING - DAY

A catwalk branches off, a SET OF STAIRS continuing down th long the canyon wall rant starts down the stairs. He's only taken a few steps dow he rusty staircase suddenl REAKS BENEATH HIS FEET aul grabs him in the nick of time. The staircase vanish int he fog. CLANFING AGAINST the canyon wall. After a few mor econds of silence, they hear the CRASH far below.
_AMANDA
"You okay?"
Grant nods and looks in the other direction.
_GRANT
"How about if we try this way?"
Their only other option is a precarious catwalk tha isappears into the mist.
_AMANDA
"Do you think it goes all the way across?"
_GRANT
"One way to find out."
The only way to get his-near-fall is to push ahead. But hi tomach turns at being so high manda follows. The catwalk creaks and groans, listin lightly. She freezes mid-stride.
_GRANT (CONT'D)
(glancing back)
"We'd better do this one at a time."
Amanda steps of and Grant carefully pushes forward isappearing into the thick fog he others listen to the CREAKING of the catwalk until it STOP BRIPTLY ILENCE.
_PAUL
"Dr. Grant?"
More silence. Then, out of the fog, a distant voice call out --
_GRANT (O.S.)
"Come on over. One at a time."
Amanda steps tentatively forwards. Eric is clinging to her.
_AMANDA
"Eric, its okay. You'll be right behind me."
_PAUL
"We're not going anywhere, I promise."
As Paul holds Eric, and Amanda shares a look.
_Amanda
"We're all together now, Eric."
Eric reluctantly releases her mother. Amanda starts to cross.

"That's it Eric. Nice and easy..."

Eric slowly gropes his way forward. He feels a GUST OF WIND an  HEAVY THUD ahead on the catwalk which now sways beneat im egaining his balance, Eric peers forward, but the fog prevent im from seeing more than fifteen feet ahead. There is an EERI ILENCE. Eric calls out timidly.
_ERIC
"Mom?"

Across the canyon, Grant moves across the later support. Wit is hand on the railing, he sends a white, hardened substanc ropping into the mist ooking up, Grant notices a large strut, covered with the sam ubstance. Realizing what it could be.

94 EXT. RIVER BANK - DAY

Paul and Amanda emerge from the water by the canyon wall an ind their son hiding behind a rock, searching the skies fo illy manda takes Eric tightly in her arms, and Paul urges them t eep moving. Up ahead, the mesh of the aviary meets the river ading the shore, Grant now scans the canyon, searching fo illy. It doesn't take long to spot him.

95 EXT. CANYON WALLL - DAY

Billy continues to struggle with the harness but to no avail he doomed young man is suspended high up on the canyon wal ike a modern Prometheus, an entire FLOCK of pteranodon athering around him preparing to peck away his liver. An verything else  MAMMOTH PTERANADON has landed beside him and looks hi traight in the eye he gigantic creature lunges at him. Billy dodges away as bes e can. The pteranodon's frustrated bite severs a crucia uncture on Billy's harness, and Billy is able to wriggle free.

96 EXT. RIVER BANK - DAY

Eric, Amanda, Paul and Grant watch in amazement as Billy is th ast to PLUNGE DOWN into the river.
_GRANT
"He made it!"
Billy bobs to the surface and spots the group downstream. H aves and begins to swim towards them. Soon he nears the shor nd gets to his feet, wading as he comes rant, Paul, Amanda and Eric hurry to meet him rant is overjoyed to see him alive. But his smile quickl ades as he see HE ENTIRE FLOCK OF PTERANODON iving down from above in angry pursuit of their lost prey.
_GRANT (CONT'D)
"Billy, look out!"
Billy glances behind him. He races forward, motioning fro hi ompanions to turn around.
_BILLY
"Get back! Get back!"
Just then Billy is knocked down by the lead pteranodon. I trikes from behind with a brutal, calculated beak to the head illy stumbles and falls to the ground rant rushes forward with Paul right after him. Amanda take ric to safety down river illy SCREAMS as the ENTIRE FLOCK of pteranodons now swarm round him, picking him apart with their beaks and claws.
_GRANT
"Billy!"
_PAUL
"It's no use, Dr. Grant. No use."
Grant can't take his eyes off Billy, whose BLOOD stains th ater rushing by nd now several pteranodons are heading their way. Difficul s it is to leave Billy behind, Grant and Paul make a run for it ust as the pteranodons are about to swoop in for the kill, Ala nd Paul dive back into the river...

97 EXT. THE RIVER - CONTINUOUS DAY

...and resurfaces on the far side of the mesh aviary wall, GASPIN or air. Just behind them, the mammot TERANODO RASHES into the mesh. It tears at the steel, actually rippin t in one place t the dock up ahead, Amanda and Eric have found a rusty aterlogged barge that's somehow still floating. Carrying  arp-covered cage, the boat was meant for transporting dino p and down the river manda pushes them away from the dock as Alan and Paul clim n board.

98 EXT. ON THE BARGE - CONTINUOUS DAY

The current takes the craft downstream, letting us get ou irst good look at the incredible

AVIARY t's a vast, domed mesh structure that spans the entire canyon n all, a feat of remarkable engineering and unmistakabl ubris atching their breath, our four survivors look at the cage the ere caught in.

99 EXT. DOWN RIVER - DAY / LATER

Yanking the starter rope one final time, Paul finally gets th ngine to turn over, PUTTERING along. Amanda is beside him ailing water.
_PAUL
"My own kid was right in front of me and I didn't do a damn thing."
_AMANDA
"You couldn't have made that jump."
_PAUL
"I should have tried. It should have been me on that beach back there, not Billy."
_AMANDA
"How would you have helped Eric?"
(he can't answer)
"He needs you, Paul. He needs us."
_PAUL
"He could have died."
_AMANDA
"But he didn't. And neither did you. And I'm glad about that."

99A UP ON THE BOW 99A

Grant is beside Eric, keeping watch, but also feeling the weigh f Billy's death.
_ERIC
"Do you have any kids?"
_GRANT
"No. Although I've studied them in the wild."
Eric looks over, not sure what that means.
_GRANT (CON'T)
"I have a theory that there's two kinds of boys. Those who want to be astronomers and those who want to be astronauts."
_ERIC
"I want to be an astronaut."
_GRANT
"See, I was the opposite. I never understood why anyone would want to go into space. It's so dangerous. You do one thing wrong and you're dead. The astronomer -- or the paleontologist -- get to study these amazing things from a place of complete safety. And truthfully, everything you really need to learn, you can learn it from the ground."
_ERIC
"But then you never get to go in space."
_GRANT
"Exactly. The difference between imagining how things might be and seeing how they really are. To be able to touch them. That's what Billy wanted to do."
The barge starts to round a bend. On the bow, Grant and Eri re the fist to see something remarkable. Eric GASPS nprepared. We don't know yet what they see.
_GRANT (cont'd)
"I can blame the people who made this island. But I can't blame the people who want to see it. To study it."
At the rear of the barge, Paul just now sees what's ahead. Awe truck, he slows the motor and motions for Amanda to take  ook. And so do we P AHEA he setting sun illuminates an incredible valley filled wit inosaurs. We see armored ANKYLOSAURS with clubbe ails. Duck-billed CORYTHOSAURS. We float under the gigantic rching necks of eighty-foot BRACHIOSAURS ith the mist from the river and the play of light, we'r itnessing a kind of primal Eden.
_GRANT (cont'd)
"How's a boy suppose to resist this?"

100 EXT. FURTHER DOWNSTREAM - NIGHT 100

A FULL MOON passes behind clouds. THUNDER quietly rumbles, an IGHTNING flickers in the distance aul is still at the wheel. The river is narrower here, an autions must be taken to avoid the banks s the barge begins to round another bend. a FAMILIAR HIGH ITCHED SOUND pierces the darkness. Muffled but unmistakable t is the RINGING SAT-PHONE ll exchange looks of sheer PANIC, expecting Spinosaurus t eap out at any moment. Grant scans the river banks.
_GRANT
"Keep quiet."
Paul cuts the motor, and time seems to stop as the four stan osed for action he barge finishes rounding the curve, and the ringing grow OUDER. The suspense is excruciating until finally.. heir eyes widen at some horrifying sight, more horrifyin han anything they've yet seen EVEN MOUNDS OF DINOSAUR DUNG sit on the patch off treeless fla round just beyond the river bank s our friends consider the sight, an idea comes to them all of the lmost simultaneously ith Eric still in the boat, Amanda, Paul, and Alan jump int he river and rush to the bank.

101 EXT. RIVER BANK - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT 101

The three companions sprint towards the source of the RINGING.
_GRANT
"Find it before it stops ringing!"
And bracing themselves and hocking their breath, they PLUNG heir arms into their respective dung-heaps. After a fe oments of this disgusting search...
_PAUL
"I've got something. I think I've got something!"
All turn to Paul. Clearing away the clinging defecation, h olds up to a beeper. And still the phone RINGS eturning to their bleak task, they shovel the excrement wit heir arms. Finally:
_AMANDA
"I've got it! I've got it!"
Grant snatches the RINGING SAT-PHONE from Amanda's hands resses a button, and puts it to his ear.
_RECORDED VOICE (ON PHONE)
"You too can own a time share in beautiful Guadalajara. Enjoy a meal in one of our four star restaurants, explore our coral reefs, or just walk on the beach..."
The Kirby’s hear the recorded voice and let out a collective eavy sigh. Grant shuts off the phone n all the excitement, none of them notice a fierce horne ARNOTAUR right behind them. The giant creature ROARS, read o eat them ut as it gets in close, it smells them. Even a dinosaur won' at something that is covered in shit. After a beat, th arnotaur turns and walks away, back into the jungle.
_PAUL
"Can't help but be a little offended."

102 EXT. BACK ON THE BARGE - NIGHT 102

CLOSE ON the cleaned satellite phone's display. The batter evel indicator is FLASHING.
_PAUL
"Whatever you do, don't call the U.S. Embassy. They won't do a God Damn thing."
_GRANT
"Well, we don't exactly have a Costa Rican phone book here, so it will have to be somebody we know in the states. Someone we can absolutely count on to send help."
_PAUL
(to Amanda)
"Stan."
_AMANDA
"I wouldn't trust Stan with a snowball in a blizzard."
Paul glares at her. Now Eric notices something odd in th iver.
_ERIC
"What's that?"
The others look down in the murky water. Just below th urface  SHIMMERING WAVE OF SILVE asses beneath the boat hen a SINGLE FISH jumps from the water. And another. An nother.
_GRANT
"Bonitas."
_ERIC
"Something must've scared them."
Another roll of THUNDER, this time much closer.
_GRANT
"Get the motor going."
Paul moves the motor and pulls the start cord. The engin putters but won't come to life nd now the phone BEEPS. The battery is getting even weaker rant makes a quick decision and DIALS.
_AMANDA
"Who are you calling?"
But Grant ignores the question. RING. RING.
_GRANT
"Pick up! Pick up!"

103 INT. ELLIE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 103

Wearing his jammies, three-year old Charlie awkwardly picks u he phone with both hands. He has the mouthpiece next to hi ips, but the earpiece is hanging out in space.
_CHARLIE
"Hewwo?"
INTERCU ecognizing who it must be...
_GRANT
"Charlie? Charlie. Get your mother. Right away!"
A long silence. Charlie bites his lip, looks around.
_GRANT (CONT'D)
"Charlie? Are you there?"
_CHARLIE
"Hewwo?"
The sat-phone BEEPS again, this time much LOUDER manda and Eric watch Grant, realizing their fate may hang o his single call. Paul struggles without success to start th otor hen, unseen by the group,  IGANTIC FI ises from the water just fifty yards from the barge. It' eaded right to them and closing fast.
_GRANT
(desperate)
"Charlie! It's the dinosaur man! Go get mommy, okay?"
_CHARLIE
"Okay."
Not sure what to do with the phone, Charlie makes a logica hoice and hangs it back up e walks away to his mom.

104 EXT. BARGE - NIGHT [END INTERCUTTING] 104

Grant realizes he's been cut off. He's about to redial whe HAM he barge is RAMMED, sending everyone tumbling. Grant manage o stay on top of the wheelhouse, but he loses grip on th hone, which falls on deck PINOSAURU ises from the water, towering over the barge. As lightnin LASHES and thunder CRACKS, the dinosaur lets out an ear plitting ROAR t lunges at Grant with gaping jaws. Grant leaps out o he way just in time as the dinosau IPS OF he entire wheelhouse.
_CUT TO:

105 INT. ELLIE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 105

Charlie leads Ellie into the room. Hands her the phone. O ourse, it's just a DIAL TONE.
_ELLIE
"Was somebody on the phone?"
_CHARLIE
"Dinosaur man."
Ellie looks at him with confusion, then quickly checks th aller ID box besides the phone. It's international, and not  umber she recognizes.
_BACK TO:

106 EXT. THE BARGE - NIGHT 106

Grant stays one step ahead of the Spinosaurus as the beast rip part the quickly-sinking boat t spits out the wheelhouse and bites down on the stern of th oat, ripping off a chunk rant is heading up to the other three when he hears the sat hone RING. He spots it, just about to fall into the water ives for it, answering...
_GRANT
"ELLIE!"

106A INT. ELLIES LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 106A

_ELLIE
"Alan?"
She can hear the Spinosaurus ROAR.
_ELLIE (CONT'D)
"Alan? Alan!"
But he's cut off by a SECOND ROAR, the sound of someon CREAMING nd then the line goes dead llie pales. Charlie looks at her with a smile.
_CHARLIE
(imitating)
"Raaaar!"

106B EXT. BACK ON THE BARGE - NIGHT 106B

Dropping the dead phone, Grant scrambles towards the front o he boat and joins Paul, Amanda and Eric, who have taken refug n the dinosaur cage he fearsome beast now lifts the stern of the boat clear out o he water he cage SCRAPES across the deck and SLAMS into the gunwale oppling off the barge an NTO THE RIVER rant and the Kirby’s are still inside.

107 EXT. THE RIVER - UNDERWATER - NIGHT 107

The cage sinks. The closest to the door, Paul manages to get out he other three aren't as lucky. The cage rotates as it descend nd lands on the river bottom with the door side down, trappin hem inside n the cold murky depths, they pull frantically on the bars ebris and equipment float around them aul surfaces out of the breath and disoriented. Spinosauru ushes past the boat. If anyone is going to save his family, i as to be him nd so he dives ushing with all his might, he manages to tip the heav tructure, just enough so Amanda, Eric and Grant can get out aul himself isn't so lucky pinosaurus grabs the cage and Paul, throwing both straight u ut of the water. Paul flies twenty feet away, further from th hore.
_AMANDA
"PAUL!"
_ERIC
"DAD!"
Spinosaurus is going after the heroic Mr. Kirby, who dives wimming underwater. He's trying to lead it away from hi amily.
_GRANT
(looking around)
"Up! Up!"
He points to a heavy crane assembly, designed for lifting cage ff the large boats. Now well accustomed to fleeing o ommand, Amanda sends Eric up first, climbing the scaffoldin ike a jungle gym ll the while, they're trying to spot Paul rant is the last to climb, reaching the first section a pinosaurus returns from the water, SLAMMING into the base o he crane. The whole assembly SHUDDERS, threatening to rip int he water.
_ERIC
"Where's Dad?"
_AMANDA
"Just hold on."
Try as it might, the beast can't climb the crane. So instead i AMS it, SHAKES it, trying to knock them off. Eric slips, bu manda catches him bout to shed his bag to climb higher, Grant finds one las ope. It's the resonation chamber model. A beat before h ecides: It may not be the best choice, but it's the only choice e blows through it, the same EERIE PITCH we heard before. O he third try, he's able to approximate the "egg" cry he hear he raptors give. He keeps it up, repeating over and over pinosaurus stops for a beat, confused How this sound could b oming from a non-raptor. But then keeps SMASHING e can hear the mounting bolts STRAIN. Soon the whole cran ill tip ut not before a MATCHING CRY is heard in the jungle. Gran tops, not certain he heard it. But there it is AGAIN e keeps blowing he crane is close to tipping when a single RAPTOR appear rom the darkness, CHIRP-BARKING at the Spinosaur, who simpl ats away ut then MORE RAPTORS come. And even MORE. Soon there ar ozens gathering, circling rant stops signaling. All three survivors watch wit orrified fascination, knowing their fate is perilous no matte hich side wins ooking at his adversaries, Spinosaurus ROARS. And suddenl he raptors attack pinosaurus easily handles the first few, but like ants the ust keep coming. They climb up his back, slicing, into him wit heir razor-sharp claws.
_GRANT
"Jump! Swim for the far shore!"
All three drop from the crane arm into the water eanwhile, the fight continues. Spinosaurus rallies, shakin ff many of the raptors, but they just keep coming. Thei ooked claws dig in, scraping the meat to the bone pinosaurus puts up a brave fight to the end, but finall ollapses, dead. The raptors continue to shred it to ribbons hen one of the raptors looks over to see the survivor wimming away ut a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. It goes back t ts meal.

107A EXT. FAR SHORE - NIGHT 107A

Grant is trying to move them along. still headed downstream ut Eric won't budge another foot.
_ERIC
"We have to keep looking for Dad. We have to."
_AMANDA
"I know. I know. I want to look for him too."
_ERIC
"then we should..."
She kneels down, facing him. She's just as upset as he is, bu otherhood carries the burden of remaining calm.
_AMANDA
"Let me tell you a few things about you Dad, okay? He's very very very clever, very very brave, and he loves you ever very much."
_ERIC
"He loves you too."
_AMANDA
"Okay. He loves us very very much. And I know that right now more than anything, your Dad would want to know that we're safe. Okay?"
Eric nods.
_AMANDA (CONT'D)
"We're going to get out of this, and everything's going to be all right, I promise."
_A VOICE
"Listen to your mother."
Out of the darkness steps Paul Kirby. Amanda is knocked ove ith surprise. Eric runs to him, nearly tackling him.
_PAUL
"Good thing I've been swimming, huh?"
Amanda hugs him and Eric so tightly they can't breath.
_CROSSFADE TO:

108-109 OMIT 108-109


110 EXT. BEACH - DAY 110

The foursome sit back on the wide beach, one facin ach direction, keeping watch. A light rain is falling, but the on't seem to notice rying to keep his boy's spirit up...
_PAUL
"You remember when we went fishing last summer? And I was trying to put the boat in and the trailer sank? And then the tow truck came and tried to pull it out, but it got dragged in? And the truck driver threatened to knock your Dad's lights out? So I said I was the governor and he believed me?"
Eric really smiles, remembering the day.
_ERIC
"Yeah."
Amanda is smiling too. She had completely forgotten th ncident.
_PAUL
"That was a fun day."
To Paul, after some consideration....
_AMANDA
"We should try fishing again."
_PAUL
"You mean it?"
_AMANDA
"I do. It's worth another shot. And who knows? Things might turn out differently."
Her hand takes his, gently brushing off the wet sand, fingertip ouching. It's a small thing, but it's a start ensing his cue to leave, Grant gets up and starts walking dow he beach. Eric hurries to follow him. He speak onspiratorially, not wanting to alarm his parents.
_ERIC
"The lady you called, how do you know she can help us?"
_GRANT
"She's the one person I could always count on. And she's saved me more times than she realizes. I owe her everything."
A long beat as they walk.
_GRANT (CONT'D)
"It's strikes me now I never told her that."
_ERIC
"You should."
_GRANT
"You're right."
As they keep walking, Grant notices something rammed agains he rocks ahead. It's a speedboat, its hull ripped open from th mpact nd it's not just any boat either -- it's the same Dino-Soa oat that was pulling the parasail. Eric hasn’t seen it yet, s rant stops him.
_GRANT (CONT'D)
"Eric, do you know what happened to the boat? that brought you here? Why did it crash?"
_ERIC
"No. I couldn't see."
_GRANT
"Do me a favor. Go back to your parents for a minute, would you?"
(pre-empting objections)
"They look worried."
Eric nods and heads back to Paul and Amanda. Grant forges on pproaching the speedboat wreckage. He doesn't know what he'l ind, but he needs to look lmost reaching his parents, Eric stops. Looks out over th cean, where he see WO LIGHTS e doesn't say anything for a moment, trying to make sur hey're real. They are. And they're coming closer.
_ERIC
(excited)
"Mom! Dad!"
They look up to see the distant lights, just now making ou ull forms...
_PAUL
"Helicopters. Helicopters!"
He SHOUTS with joy. Paul, Amanda and Eric wave their arms aking as much motion as possible. The helicopters -- bi ilitary choppers -- change direction, heading straight fo hem aul and Amanda embrace, then kiss, the moment getting the bes f the T THE SPEEDBOA rant looks in, prepared to see anything in the wreckage. Bu he cabin is surprisingly intact, just a little blood. There ar hree gashes on the driver's seat back. Grant measures thei pacing with his fingers.
_ERIC
(yelling over)
"Dr. Grant! Helicopters are coming!"
Grant looks down to the wet sand around him, finding a trail o hree-toed tracks.
_ERIC (CONT'D)
"We're safe!"
_GRANT
(to himself)
"No we're not."
THE FIRST CHOPPER lies right overhead. Paul and Amanda are confused, until th econd helicopter starts to land -- the first on is there to over them rant YELLS at the first chopper, trying to wave it away. Bu he noise of the blades is DEAFENDING.
_GRANT (CONT'D)
"NO! STAY BACK! THEY'RE IN THE TREES!"
At the treeline, the upper branches are shaking. At first, i ooks like it's just the wind off the chopper, bu omething more is happening.

A PTERANODO lies up out of the trees, the first of twenty. It's a gorgeou nd terrifying sight.

110A INT. FIRST CHOPPER - DAWN 110A

Terrified, the Costa Rican CHOPPER PILOT veers away, but th teranodons are already on him. They SMASH at the windows rabbing on the skids, The chopper rolls wildly ne over-eager pteranodon sticks his head up to high, gettin ecapitated by the blade.

110B EXT. BEACH - DAWN 110B

As the second chopper touches down on the beach, Eric, Amand nd Paul load in. Grant is running their way.

110C EXT. BY THE TREES - DAWN 110C

Meanwhile, the first copper is losing the battle even as i limbs higher. The helicopter suddenly tips, falling, SMASHIN nto the trees with a massive fireball.

110D INT. SECOND CHOPPER - DAWN 110D

Seeing the explosion, the SECOND CHOPPER PILOT takes off. Eric manda and Paul are on board, but Grant is still running up he helicopter passes right over him.
_AMANDA
(to the pilot)
"You have to go back! We can't leave him!"
Seeing a ladder release by the door, Paul throws the lever. A cord nd-steel-ladder unfurls, dragging across the sand.

110E EXT. THE BEACH - DAWN 110E

Grant chases after us, catching a rung just as it goes over th ater. Behind him, pteranodons are circling the wreckage o he first chopper and starting to go after the second uffeted by the wind, Grant climbs the ladder up towards th hopper. A pteranodon flies up right behind him, trying t ite. It catches Grant's shoulder rant spins to the far side of the ladder. The pteranodon goe o bite him again, but finds it head caught between the rungs s it tries to free itself, it just gets more entangled he entire ladder starts to lift, caught by the updraft from th reature’s wings.

110F INT. SECOND CHOPPER - DAWN 110F

Up with the pilot, Amanda sees the other pteranodons are heade ack to the island, unable to keep up.
_AMANDA
"They're not following."
In back, Paul and Eric get the ladder mechanism to begin t etract. It reels Grant in faster. It also reels in th teranodon, which may be caught, but is still plenty dangerous s Grant reaches the cabin, they shut off the ladder engine he pteranodon is still working its way free, pulling itself close nd closer.
_GRANT
(shouting over the noise)
"We have to cut it! Find something sharp!"
Everyone checking the cabin for a knife, anything sharp inally, Eric hands Grant the raptor claw rant uses it to rip the line. The fibers break and fray, bu he pteranodon keeps coming closer aul throws a wrench at the pteranodon, WHACKING it straigh n the head. It felt good, and damn if it didn't slow it down  ittle rant has cut through the cord. He started on the second whe he pteranodon SNAPS at him, going for his hand. There' owhere for Grant to cut without the pteranodon getting him nd idea, Grant very deliberately places in his hand on the line ulling away at the last moment. The pteranodon itself bite hrough the line.

110G EXT. OCEAN - DAWN 110G

The pteranodon falls away from the helicopter, catching win ust before it hits the water t circles and flies back to Isla Sorna s horrifying as the creature was a moment ago, it's suddenl eautiful again. Each motion of its giant wings is a smal ymphony.

110H INT. COPPER / FLYING - DAWN 110H

Sitting between his parents, Eric looks back at the island i he distance.
_ERIC
"What do you think is going to happen with the dinosaurs?"
_GRANT
"The population will Stabilize eventually. They'll adapt to fit different roles."
ON PAUL AND AMANDA
_PAUL
"Either that, or the government will firebomb it back to the Stone Age."
_AMANDA
"I would completely support that."
ON ERIC AND GRAN ooking back at the island.
_ERIC
"I hope they don't. I want to come back someday."
And Dr. Grant realizes...
_GRANT
"So do I."
