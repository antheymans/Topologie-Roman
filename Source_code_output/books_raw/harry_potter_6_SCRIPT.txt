_SNAPE
"If the Dark Lord has forbidden it, you ought not to speak."

"Put it down, Bella. We mustn't touch what isn't ours."
Bellatrix, DARK CURIO in hand, glowers, sets it bac own.

"You should feel honored, Cissy. As should Draco --"
_NARCISSA
"He's just a boy!"
_SNAPE
"I can't change the Dark Lord's mind. But it might be possible for me to help Draco. To provide some... protection."
Bellatrix eyes Snape keenly.

_SNAPE
"I can try."
_NARCISSA
"Oh, Severus, please, if you"

Snape's eyes shift, meet Bellatrix's challenging gaze.
_BELLATRIX
"Make the Unbreakable Vow."

"You see. It's just empty words. Oh he'll try. He'll give it his best effort. But when it matters most he'll slither back into his hole. Bloody coward..."

Late. Lonely men and women loiter on the platform. At  ood stand, patrons grimly read their TABLOID of choice AMERA TRACKS PAST The Daily Mail, The Sun, The Mirror - ANDS ON... the Daily Prophet. The SILHOUETTE. Th EADLINE: "HARRY POTTER: THE CHOSEN ONE? ut the (unseen) reader is fixated on a SMALLER ITEM ucked at the bottom corner of the back page: "Malfo entenced to Azkaban." TWO PHOTOGRAPHS accompany th iece, one of LUCIUS MALFOY, another of Narcissa an RACO MALFOY as they exit a courtroom. Draco's eyes loo istant, haunted.
_WAITRESS (O.S.)
"Harry Potter. Who's Harry Potter?"
The paper drops, reveals... Harry. He glances up at th OUNG WAITRESS who stands over him. Pretty. Ver retty.
_HARRY
"Oh. Um. No one. Bit of a tosser."
As she leans over to clear his chips wrappings, Harry' aze drifts over the smooth skin of her neck, the spra f freckles across one cheek...
_WAITRESS
"Funny that paper of yours. Couple nights ago, I could swear I saw one of the pictures move."
_HARRY
"Really."
_WAITRESS
"Thought I'd gone round the twist."
She makes a face, smiles. A smile to die for. Starts t o.
_HARRY
"Hey. I was wondering..."
_WAITRESS

"You can tell me all about that tosser Harry Potter."
Harry watches her go, then quickly reaches into his coa nd fumbles out a S'Mints container. Just then.. CONTINUED)

... a LIGHT on the opposite PLATFORM FLICKERS. Harr ooks. It FLICKERS again and this time a small cloud o LITTERING DUST dances over the opposite platform. As  RAIN ROARS past, Harry squints through the flickerin indows and watches the dust transform into... ALBU UMBLEDORE. Leveling his glasses, he peers across th latform, smiles and gives Harry a wave.

13 EXT. OPPOSITE PLATFORM - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER)

As Harry arrives, he finds Dumbledore studying a PERFUM DVERTISEMENT which shows a MODEL with a WAND in he eeth: "Tonight Make a Little Magic With Your Man."
_DUMBLEDORE
"I once knew a Muggle girl from Liverpool with hair like spun silk. No light could resist it..."
(turning)
"You've been reckless this summer, Harry."
_HARRY
"I like riding round on the trains. It takes my mind off... things."
Harry hesitates, notices Dumbledore's hand is ASH BLACK.
_DUMBLEDORE
"Rather unpleasant to behold, isn't it? The tale is thrilling if I do say so myself, but I'm afraid now is not the time to tell it. Take my arm."
(extending it)
"Do as I say."
Harry glances across the platform, sees the freckle aitress appear, eye his empty table. Slowly, he reache ut and -- instantly -- all goes BLACK in a RUSH of SOUN nd FURY, as if Harry had been pitched headlong into  ornado. Seconds later...

14 EXT. VILLAGE SQUARE - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER)

_HARRY
"I just Apparated, didn't I?"
(CONTINUED)

_DUMBLEDORE
"Indeed. And quite successfully I might add. Most people vomit their first time."
_HARRY
"Can't imagine why..."
NEW ANGLE - MOMENTS LATE umbledore leads Harry up a steep narrow street line ith darkened houses.
_DUMBLEDORE
"Welcome to the charming village of Budleigh Babberton, Harry. I assume right about now you're wondering why I've brought you here, am I right?"
_HARRY
(glancing about)
"After all these years, I just sort of roll with it, sir."
Dumbledore smiles mildly, then pauses, his fac arkening. Before them stands a SMALL STONE HOUSE. Bu omething is wrong about the place.
_DUMBLEDORE
"Wand out, Harry."

15 INT. SLUGHORN'S HOUSE - SAME TIME - NIGHT

THROUGH a crack in the front door: Dumbledore and Harr ove swiftly up the walk and enter.
_DUMBLEDORE
"Lumos..."
The tip of Dumbledore's WAND BLAZES. He sweeps th hadows. CALLS OUT.
_DUMBLEDORE
"Horace!"
Nothing. Dumbledore points his wand down a NARRO ALLWAY. Motes of dust dance in the wandlight, bu othing else. He starts down the hallway, toward th PEN DOORWAY at its end. Slowly, the room beyond come NTO VIEW ARRY POTTER... HALF-BLOOD PRINCE - Rev. 11/6/07 10.

16 INT. SLUGHORN'S HOUSE - SITTING ROOM - NIGHT

Utter devastation. A GRANDFATHER CLOCK lays upon th loor, its face cracked. A PIANO sags in the corner eys strewn like teeth upon the rug. A copy of the Dail rophet trembles in the breeze from a half-open window s Harry looks, a DROP of something WET strikes the word
"CHOSEN." His gaze rises.
He GASPS. A substance DARK and GLUTINOUS is spattere pon the ceiling. Dumbledore raises his wand. Th eiling SCREAMS RED. Another drop falls and this on trikes Harry's SCAR. As Harry moves to wipe it away umbledore grabs his hand raining his light on Harry's forehead, Dumbledore flick  blackened finger over the scar. Brings it to hi ongue. Reacts. Turning, his eyes narrow on a VERSTUFFED ARMCHAIR. Moving to it, he JABS his wan nto the plump seat cushion.
_ARMCHAIR
"Merlin's Beard!"
Instantly, the Armchair mutates into HUMAN FORM, thoug riefly gets caught inbetween. After a bit of GRUMBLING EAM-SPLITTING and the POPPING of a cushion button o wo, a FAT OLD MAN (HORACE SLUGHORN) in a pair of WELL ORN lilac pajamas appears.
_SLUGHORN
(rubbing his rump)
"There's no need to disfigure me, Albus!"
_DUMBLEDORE
"I must say, you make a very convincing armchair, Horace."
_SLUGHORN
"It's all in the upholstery."
(patting his stomach)
"I come by the stuffing naturally. What gave me away?"
_DUMBLEDORE
(nodding to the
 ceiling)
"Dragon's blood."
_SLUGHORN
"Yes, well, I couldn't very well use wizard's blood, could I? Oho!"

Slughorn takes a step back, having spotted Harry. Th lood on Harry's forehead only serves to highlight hi car.
_DUMBLEDORE
"Ah yes. Introductions. Harry, this is an old friend and colleague of mine, Horace Slughorn. Horace, this is, well, you know who this is."
(a droll whisper)
"Apparently there's some thought he may be the Chosen One."
Slughorn stares at Harry as if hypnotized.
_DUMBLEDORE
"So why all the theatrics, Horace? You weren't perhaps expecting someone else, were you?"
_SLUGHORN
(blinking)
"S-someone else? I'm sure I don't know what you mean."
Dumbledore raises an eyebrow. Slughorn caves.
_SLUGHORN
"Oh all right! The Death Eaters have been trying to recruit me for over a year. Do you know what that's like? One can only say no to these people so many times before they..."
_DUMBLEDORE
"Take matters into their own hands?"
Slughorn eyes Dumbledore miserably, gestures.
_SLUGHORN
"I never stay anywhere more than a week. The Muggles who own this place are in the Canary Islands."
_DUMBLEDORE
"Well, I think it should be put back in order for them, don't you? Mind?"
(CONTINUED)

Dumbledore raises his wand. Instantly, the grandfathe lock resumes its rightful place, shattered lanterns re gnite and the blood on the ceiling evaporates -- just a he piano keys tumble back into place with a pleasan USICAL run.
_DUMBLEDORE
"That was fun. May I use the loo?"
As Dumbledore heads down the hall, Slughorn calls after.
_SLUGHORN
"Don't think I don't know why you're here, Albus! The answer is still no! Absolutely, unequivocally no!"
Dumbledore doesn't respond. Slughorn glances at Harry he silence is palpable. Awkward. A beat. Then:
_SLUGHORN
"You look very like your father. Except for your eyes. You've got --"
_HARRY
"My mother's eyes, yeah."
_SLUGHORN
(smiling softly)
"Lily. Lovely Lily. She was exceedingly bright -- your mother. Even more impressive when one considers she was Muggle-born."
_HARRY
"One of my best friends is Muggle- born. She's the best in our year."
_SLUGHORN
"Oh, but you mustn't think I'm prejudiced! No, no, no! Your mother was one of my absolute favorites! Look, there she is. Right up front."
Slughorn waves to a dresser crowded with PHOTOGRAPHS.
_SLUGHORN
"All mine, each and every one. Ex- students, I mean. You recognize Barnubas Cuffe, of course, editor of the Daily Prophet."

That is, when I had a house. And Gwenog Jones, captain of the Holyhead Harpies -- free tickets whenever I want them. Of course, I haven't been to a match in some time..."
Harry steps forward, takes a picture of one particula OY, a boy who resembles... Sirius. Seeing Harry thu istracted, he studies him intently, like a rare object.
_SLUGHORN
"Ah yes. Regulus Black. You no doubt know of his older brother Sirius. Died a few weeks ago. I taught the whole Black family except Sirius. Shame. Talented boy. I got Regulus when he came along, of course, but I'd have liked the set."
_DUMBLEDORE
"Mind if I take this? I do love knitting patterns."
Slughorn blinks, looks away from Harry and find umbledore standing there, clutching a MUGGLE MAGAZINE.
_SLUGHORN
"Of course. But you're not leaving?"
_DUMBLEDORE
"I think I know a lost cause when I see one. Regrettable. I would have considered it a personal triumph had you consented to return to Hogwarts, Horace. You are, like my friend Mr. Potter -- one of a kind."

"Indeed they are."

18 EXT. STREET (BUDLEIGH BABBERTON) - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER)

Dumbledore leads Harry back toward the Village Square.
_HARRY
"Sir, exactly what was that all --"
_DUMBLEDORE
"You are talented, famous and powerful -- everything Horace values. Professor Slughorn is going to try to collect you, Harry. You would be his crowning jewel. That is why he is returning to Hogwarts. And it is crucial he return..."
Harry looks intrigued by this last statement, but befor e can pursue it, Dumbledore glances ruefully at th oon.
_DUMBLEDORE
"I fear I may have stolen a wondrous night from you, Harry. She was, truthfully, very pretty. The girl."
_HARRY
"It's alright, sir. I'll go back tomorrow, make some excuse --"
Harry stops. Dumbledore is shaking his head.
_DUMBLEDORE
"You'll not be going back to Little Whinging tonight, Harry."

Mrs. Weasley throws her hands up over her face.

As Riddle's fingers touch the box, the flames engulfin he wardrobe vanish, but the box continues to SHAKE - he only sound in the now-silent room.

"Is there anything in that box you ought not to have?"

_SLUGHORN
"Of course. It's only natural that you should want to know more. I'm afraid I must disappoint you, Harry. When I first met young Mr. Riddle, he was simply a quiet, albeit brilliant, boy committed to becoming a first-rate wizard. Not unlike the others I've known. In fact, not unlike... you. If the monster existed, it was buried deep within."

16-YEAR-OLD TOM RIDDLE and five other BOYS. The CRYSTAL

HOURGLASS sits on a side table.
_TOM RIDDLE
"Sir, is it true that Professor Merrythought is retiring?"
Slughorn chuckles, wags a sugar-encrusted finger a iddle.
_SLUGHORN
"Now, Tom, I couldn't tell you if I knew, could I? I must say, m'boy, I'd like to know where you get your information. More knowledgeable than half the staff, you are."

 laugh)
"By the way, thank you for the pineapple -- you're quite right, it is my favorite -- how is it you knew?"

Riddle smiles but his expression suggests intuition ha othing to do with it. Slughorn chuckles uneasily.

"Good gracious, look at the time. Off you go, boys, or Professor Dippett will have us all in detention. Lestrange, Avery, don't forget your essays..."
As the others file out, Slughorn busies himself with som apers when -- Ping! -- he turns, finds Riddle stil here, standing by the crystal hourglass.
_SLUGHORN
"Look sharp, Tom. You don't want to be caught out of bed after hours..."
_TOM RIDDLE
"I know a secret shortcut or two."
_SLUGHORN
"Yes, I imagine you do. Something on your mind, Tom?"
_TOM RIDDLE
"Yes, sir. I couldn't think of anyone else to go to. The other professors, well, they're not like you. They might... misunderstand."

"Go on."
Riddle slips off the RING on his left hand, begins t oll it between his fingers. It is set with a BLAC TONE.

"I was in the library the other night, in the Restricted section, and I read something rather odd, about a bit of rare magic, and I thought perhaps you could illuminate me..."

"This is perhaps the most important memory I've collected. It's also a lie."
(off Harry's look)
"This memory has been tampered with. In this case by the person whose memory it is, our friend Professor Slughorn."
_HARRY
"But why would he tamper with his own memory?"
_DUMBLEDORE
"I suspect he is ashamed of it."
_HARRY
"Why?"

"Why indeed."
Dumbledore trails his withered fingers in the Pensieve.

As the tiny ones scurry out, Harry is revealed, waitin ust outside the door. He enters. For a moment lughorn merely HUMS over his briefcase, unaware hen...

_SLUGHORN
"Yes? And exactly what was this rare magic."
_HARRY
"I'm not sure... That is, I don't recall the name... exactly. But it got me wondering... Are there some kinds of magic you're not allowed to teach?"
Slughorn looks up, eyes Harry carefully.
_SLUGHORN
"I'm a Potions Professor, Harry. Perhaps your question would best be posed to Professor Snape."
_HARRY
"Yes, well, we don't exactly see eye-to-eye, sir. What I mean to say is, he's not like you. He might... misunderstand."
Recognition flickers in Slughorn's eyes. A glint o ear.
_SLUGHORN
"There can be no light without the dark. And so it is with magic. Myself, I have always strived to live within the light. I suggest you do the same."
Slughorn gathers his briefcase, starts to exit.
_HARRY
"Did you say the same to Tom Riddle, sir? When he came asking questions."
Slughorn freezes in the doorway, then slowly turns.

"Yes, sir. It's just, well, Dumbledore once said that fear of a name only increases fear of the thing itself. It seemed sensible."

"With all due respect, Dumbledore sometimes forgets that most of us do not possess powers so great that we can risk offending the most dangerous Dark Lord who ever lived."

TWO AURORS, twin SILHOUETTES, patrol the grounds. Harr pproaches, about to intersect their paths when, at th ast second, something on the ground catches his eye.

Harry HUMS placidly. Up ahead, a FIGURE ripples beyon he steamy panes of the Greenhouse. It's Slughorn unched over a PLANT whose TENDRILS coil eerily esisting his attentions. Snip! He stealthily removes  prig, looks up and JUMPS.
_SLUGHORN
"Merlin's beard, Harry!"
_HARRY
"Sorry, sir. I should've announced myself. Cleared my throat. Coughed. You probably feared I was Madam Sprout."
_SLUGHORN
"Well, yes, actually --"
(paranoid)
"Why would you think that?"
_HARRY
"Just the general behavior, sir. The sneaking around. The jumping when you saw me. By the way, those Tentacula leaves -- they're quite valuable, aren't they?"
_SLUGHORN
"Ten galleons a leaf to the right buyer -- not that I'm familiar with such back alley transactions. One hears rumors is all. My own interests are purely academic, of course."
_HARRY
"Personally, these plants have always kind of freaked me out."
Harry gives a little SHIVER of the shoulders, smiles lughorn cocks his head, studies him oddly.
_SLUGHORN
"Exactly how did you get out of the castle, Harry?"

"Through the front doors, sir. I'm off to Hagrid's, you see. He's a very dear friend and I felt like paying him a visit. So if you don't mind, I'll be going."

Harry appears over a rise, strolling happily along.. hen Slughorn appears, huffing and puffing to keep up.
_SLUGHORN
"Harry, I must insist you accompany me back to the castle immediately!"
_HARRY
"That would be counterproductive, sir."
_SLUGHORN
"And what makes you say that?"
_HARRY
"No idea."
Slughorn frowns impatiently -- then stops, blinks.

Harry, Hagrid and Slughorn sit at the massive kitche able, which is strewn with EMPTY WINE BOTTLES. Hagri nd Slughorn are feeling no pain, while Harry looks clear yed, focused.
_HAGRID/SLUGHORN
"To the place he'd known as a lad, They laid him to rest with his hat inside out and his wand snapped in two, which was sad..."
As they finish, both men CHUCKLE. Hagrid tops of veryone's mug with a bit more wine. Harry brings hi ug to his lap... then slyly pours it into the bucket a is feet.

"I had `im from an egg, yeh know. Tiny little thing he was when he hatched. No bigger'n a Pekinese."

Thunk! Hagrid's great shaggy head hits the table nstantly, he is SNORING, so DEEPLY his MUG shimmie cross the table. Slughorn smiles, regards Harry, wh erely stares back. Slughorn averts his eyes. Suddenl ervous. A WIND rises outside. Windowpanes rattle.
_SLUGHORN
"It was a student who gave me Francis. One spring afternoon I discovered a bowl upon my desk with a few inches of clear water. There was a flower petal floating upon the surface. As I watched, the petal sank, but just before it touched bottom... it transformed. Into a wee fish. It was beautiful magic, wondrous to behold. The petal had come from a lily."
Hearing "lily," Harry looks up. Slughorn nods.
_SLUGHORN
"Your mother. The day I came downstairs, the day I found the bowl empty... was the day she..."
Slughorn falters, pain etching his face.
_SLUGHORN
"I know what you want. But I can't give it to you. It will ruin me..."
Harry studies Slughorn a moment, thinking, then speaks.
_HARRY
"Do you know why I survived? The night I got this."
Slughorn looks up, sees Harry pointing to his scar.
_HARRY
"Because of her. Because she sacrificed herself. Because she refused to step aside. Because her love was more powerful than Voldemort."

"Please don't say his --"

_HARRY
"I'm not afraid of the name, Professor. And I'm not afraid of him. And you shouldn't be either. She didn't just die for me that night. She died for you too. She died for everyone who's ever woken in the middle of the night afraid a Death Eater waited on their doorstep."
Slughorn gazes into the guttering candle before him.
_HARRY
"Professor. I'm going to tell you something, something others have only guessed at. It's true. I am the Chosen One."
Slughorn looks up. Harry nods.
_HARRY
"Only I can kill him. But in order to do so, I need to know what Tom Riddle asked you that night in your office all those years ago. And I need to know what you told him."
Slughorn's eyes well with tears, his hands tremble.
_HARRY
"Be brave, Professor. Be brave like my mother. Otherwise you disgrace her. Otherwise she died for nothing. Otherwise, the bowl remains empty forever."
Slughorn shakes his head, staring into the candle inally, slowly, he removes his wand.
_SLUGHORN
"Don't think too badly of me once you've seen it. You don't know what he was like... even then."
Slughorn fishes out a tiny vial -- the one with the WOR - but his hand is shaking so violently, Harry has t ake it. Slowly, Slughorn raises his wand, touches it t is temple and withdraws a LONG, SILVER THREAD. Harr xtends the vial and... it drops within.

Dumbledore holds the vial in wonderment. The worm hang n eerie suspension.

"Sir, is it true that Professor Merrythought is retiring?"
Slughorn chuckles, wags a sugar-encrusted finger a iddle.
_SLUGHORN
"Now, Tom, I couldn't tell you if I knew, could I? I must say, m'boy, I'd like to know where you get your information. More knowledgable than half the staff, you are."

 laugh)
"By the way, thank you for the pineapple -- you're quite right, it is my favorite -- how is it you knew?"
_TOM RIDDLE
"Intuition."
_SLUGHORN

"Good gracious, is it that time already? Off you go, boys, or Professor Dippett will have us all in detention. Lestrange, Avery, don't forget your essays..."

"I know a secret shortcut or two."
_SLUGHORN
"Yes, I imagine you do. Something on your mind, Tom?"
_TOM RIDDLE
"Yes, sir. I couldn't think of anyone else to go to. The other Professors, well, they're not like you. They might... misunderstand."
_SLUGHORN
"Go on."
_TOM RIDDLE
"I was in the library the other night, in the Restricted section, and I read something rather odd, about a bit of rare magic and I thought perhaps you could illuminate me. It's called, as I understand it... a Horcrux."
Slughorn's weak smile evaporates altogether.
_SLUGHORN
"Excuse me?"
_TOM RIDDLE
"Horcrux. I came across the term while reading and I didn't fully understand it."
_SLUGHORN
"I'm not sure what you were reading, Tom, but that's very Dark stuff, very Dark indeed."
_TOM RIDDLE
"Yes, sir. Which is why I came to you. I mean no disrespect to the rest of the staff, but I thought if anyone could tell me... it would be you."
Slughorn frowns, clearly disturbed, then speaks quietly CONTINUED ARRY POTTER... HALF-BLOOD PRINCE - Rev. 11/6/07

"A Horcrux is an object in which a person has concealed part of their soul."
_TOM RIDDLE
"Yes, I thought it might be something like that. But I don't understand how that works, sir."
_SLUGHORN
"One splits one's soul and hides part of it in an object. By doing so, you are protected should you be attacked and your body destroyed."
_TOM RIDDLE
"Protected?"
_SLUGHORN
"That part of your soul that was hidden, lives on. In other words, you cannot die."
Riddle nods and TURNS AWAY, staring at himself in th IRROR on the wall opposite. A hint of RED glints in hi yes.
_TOM RIDDLE
"How does one split his soul, sir?"
_SLUGHORN
"I think you can guess the answer to that, Tom."
_TOM RIDDLE
"Murder."
_SLUGHORN
"Yes. Killing rips the soul apart. It is a violation against nature. After, one is never the same."
_TOM RIDDLE
"Out of curiosity, sir -- can you only split your soul once? For instance, isn't seven the most powerfully magical number --"
_SLUGHORN
"Seven! Merlin's beard, Tom! Isn't it bad enough to think of killing one person? To rip the soul into seven pieces..."
