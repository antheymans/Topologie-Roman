_Screenplay by Dan O'Bannon

_SYNOPSIS
En route back to Earth from a far part of the galaxy, the crew of th tarship SNARK intercepts a transmission in an alien language riginating from a nearby storm-shrouded planet ankind has waited centuries to contact another form of intelligen ife in the universe -- they decide to land and investigate. Thei earch takes them to a wrecked alien spacecraft whose doors gape ope - it is dead and abandoned. Inside they find, among other strang hings, the skeleton of one of the unearthly space travellers ertain clues in the wrecked ship lead them across the hostile surfac f the planet to a primitive stone pyramid, the only remnant of  anished civilization. Beneath this pyramid they find an ancient tom ull of fantastic artifacts. Lying dormant in the tomb are centuries ld spores, which are triggered into life by the men's presence.  arasite emerges and fastens itself to one of the men's faces -- an annot be removed n examination by the ship's medical computer reveals that th reature has inserted a tube down his throat, which is depositin omething inside him. Then it is discovered that the parasite's bloo s a horribly corrosive acid which eats through metal -- they dare no ill it on the ship ltimately it is dislodged from its victim and ejected from the ship nd they blast off from the Hell-planet. However, before they can sea hemselves into suspended animation for the long voyage home,  orrible little monster emerges from the victim's body -- it has bee rowing in him, deposited there by the parasite... and now it is loos n the ship  series of ghastly adventures follow. They trap it in an air shaf nd a man has to crawl down the shaft with a flamethrower -- it tear  man's head off and runs away with his body -- a man is crushed i he air lock door and the ship loses most of its air in a terrifi indstorm -- another man is burned to death and then eaten by th reature -- and another is woven into a cocoon as part of the alien' izarre life cycle inally there is only one man left alive, alone on the ship with th reature, and only six hours till his air runs out; which leads to  limax of horrifying, explosive jeopardy, the outcome of whic etermines who will reach Earth alive -- man or alien.

FADE IN XTREME CLOSEUPS OF FLICKERING INSTRUMENT PANELS. Readouts and digita isplays pulse eerily with the technology of the distant future herever we are, it seems to be chill, dark, and sterile. Electroni achinery chuckles softly to itself bruptly we hear a BEEPING SIGNAL, and the machinery begins to awaken ircuits close, lights blink on AMERA ANGLES GRADUALLY WIDEN, revealing more and more of th achinery, banks of panels, fluttering gauges, until we reveal NTERIOR - HYPERSLEEP VAUL  stainless steel room with no windows, the walls packed wit nstrumentation. The lights are dim and the air is frigid ccupying most of the floor space are rows of horizontal FREEZE OMPARTMENTS, looking for all the world like meat lockers OOM! FOOM! FOOM! With explosions of escaping gas, the lids on th reezers pop open lowly, groggily, six nude men sit up.
_ROBY
"Oh... God... am I cold... "
_BROUSSARD
"Is that you, Roby?"
_ROBY
"I feel like shit... "
_BROUSSARD
"Yeah, it's you all right."
Now they are yawning, stretching, and shivering.
_FAUST
(groans)
"Ohh... I must be alive, I feel dead."
_BROUSSARD
"You look dead."
_MELKONIS
"The vampires rise from their graves."
This draws a few woozy chuckles.
_BROUSSARD
(shakes his fist in the
 air triumphantly)
"We made it!"
_HUNTER
(not fully awake)
"Is it over?"
_STANDARD
"It's over, Hunter."
_HUNTER
(yawning)
"Boy, that's terrific."
_STANDARD
(looking around with a grin)
"Well, how does it feel to be rich men?"
_FAUST
"Cold!"
This draws a LAUGH.
_STANDARD
"Okay! Everybody topside! Let's get our pants on and get to our posts!"
The men begin to swing out of the freezers.
_MELKONIS
"Somebody get the cat."
Roby picks a limp cat out of a freezer NTERIOR - CONTROL ROO his is a fantastic circular room, jammed with instrumentation. Ther re no windows, but above head level the room is ringed b iewscreens, all blank for the moment here are seats for four men. Each chair faces a console and i urrounded by a dazzling array of technology TANDARD, ROBY, BROUSSARD, and MELKONIS are entering and finding thei eats.
_BROUSSARD
"I'm going to buy a cattle ranch."
_ROBY
(putting down the cat)
"Cattle ranch!"
_BROUSSARD
"I'm not kidding. You can get one if you have the credit. Look just like real cows, too."
_STANDARD
"All right, tycoons, let's stop spending our credit and start worrying about the job at hand."
_ROBY
"Right. Fire up all systems."
They begin to throw switches, lighting up their consoles. The contro oom starts to come to life. All around the room, colored light licker and chase each other across glowing screens. The room fill ith the hum and chatter of machinery.
_STANDARD
"Sandy, you want to give us some vision?"
_MELKONIS
"Feast your eyes."
Melkonis reaches to his console and presses a bank of switches. Th trip of viewscreens flickers into life n each screen, we see BLACKNESS SPECKLED WITH STARS.
_BROUSSARD
(after a pause)
"Where's Irth?"
_STANDARD
"Sandy, scan the whole sky."
Melkonis hits buttons. On the screens the images all begin to pan AMERA MOVES IN ON ONE OF THE SCREENS, with its moving image of  tarfield XTERIOR - OUTER SPAC LOSE SHOT OF A PANNING TV CAMERA. This camera is remote controlled urning silently on its base AMERA BEGINS TO PULL BACK, revealing that the TV camera is mounted o he HULL OF SOME KIND OF CRAFT hen the pullback is finished, WE SEE THE FULL LENGTH OF THE STARSHIP
"SNARK," hanging in the depths of interstellar space, against a
background of glimmering stars NTERIOR - BRIDGE
_ROBY
"Where are we?"
_STANDARD
"Sandy, contact traffic control."
Melkonis switches on his radio unit.
_MELKONIS
"This is deep space commercial vessel SNARK, registration number E180246, calling Antarctica air traffic control. Do you read me? Over."
There is only the HISS OF STATIC.
_BROUSSARD
(staring at a screen)
"I don't recognize that constellation."
_STANDARD
"Dell, plot our location."
Broussard goes into action, punching buttons, lighting up all hi nstruments.
_BROUSSARD
"I got it. Oh boy."
_STANDARD
"Where the hell are we?"
_BROUSSARD
"Just short of Zeta II Reticuli. We haven't even reached the outer rim yet."
_ROBY
"What the hell?"
Standard picks up a microphone.
_STANDARD
"This is Chaz speaking. Sorry, but we are not home. Our present location seems to be only halfway to Irth. Remain at your posts and stand by. That is all."
_ROBY
"Chaz, I've got something here on my security alert. A high priority from the computer... "
_STANDARD
"Let's hear it."
_ROBY
(punches buttons)
"Computer, you have signalled a priority three message. What is the message?"
_COMPUTER
(a mechanical voice)
"I have interrupted the course of the voyage."
_ROBY
"What? Why?"
_COMPUTER
"I am programmed to do so if certain conditions arise."
_STANDARD
"Computer, this is Captain Standard. What conditions are you talking about?"
_COMPUTER
"I have intercepted a transmission of unknown origin."
_STANDARD
"A transmission?"
_COMPUTER
"A voice transmission."
_MELKONIS
"Out here?"
The men exchange glances.
_COMPUTER
"I have recorded the transmission."
_STANDARD
"Play it for us, please."
Over the speakers, we hear a hum, a crackle, static... THEN  TRANGE, UNEARTHLY VOICE FILLS THE ROOM, SPEAKING AN ALIE ANGUAGE. The bizarre voice speaks a long sentence, then fall ilent he men all stare at each other in amazement.
_STANDARD
"Computer, what language was that?"
_COMPUTER
"Unknown."
_ROBY
"Unknown! What do you mean?"
_COMPUTER
"It is none of the"
dialect spoken by technological man."
There is a pause, then EVERYBODY STARTS TALKING AT THE SAME TIME.
_STANDARD
(silencing them)
"Just hold it, hold it!"
(glares around the room)
"Computer: have you attempted to analyze the transmission?"
_COMPUTER
"Yes. There are two points of salient interest. Number one: it is highly systematized, indicating intelligent origin. Number two: certain sounds are inconsistent with the human palate."
_ROBY
"Oh my God."
_STANDARD
"Well, it's finally happened."
_MELKONIS
"First contact... "
_STANDARD
"Sandy, can you home in on that beam?"
_MELKONIS
"What's the frequency?"
_STANDARD
"Computer, what's the frequency of the transmission?"
_COMPUTER
"65330 dash"
Melkonis punches buttons.
_MELKONIS
"I've got it. It's coming from ascension"

_STANDARD
"Dell -- show me that on a screen."
_BROUSSARD
"I'll give it to you on number four."
Broussard punches buttons. One of the viewscreens flickers, and  mall dot of light becomes visible in the corner of the screen.
_BROUSSARD (CONT'D)
"That's it. Let me straighten it out."
He twists a knob, moving the image on the screen till the dot is i he center.
_STANDARD
"Can you get it a little closer?"
_BROUSSARD
"That's what I'm going to do."
He hits a button. The screen flashes and a PLANET APPEARS.
_BROUSSARD (CONT'D)
"Planetoid. Diameter, 120 kilometers."
_MELKONIS
"It's tiny!"
_STANDARD
"Any rotation?"
_BROUSSARD
"Yeah. Two hours."
_STANDARD
"Gravity?"
_BROUSSARD
"Point eight six. We can walk on it."
Standard rises.
_STANDARD
"Martin, get the others up to the lounge."
INTERIOR - MULTI-PURPOSE ROO he entire crew -- STANDARD, ROBY, BROUSSARD, MELKONIS, HUNTER, an AUST -- are all seated around a table, with Standard at the head.
_MELKONIS
"If it's an S.O.S., we're morally obligated to investigate."
_BROUSSARD
"Right."
_HUNTER
"I don't know. Seems to me we came on this trip to make some credit, not to go off on some kind of side trip."
_BROUSSARD
(excited)
"Forget the credit; what we have here is a chance to be the first men to contact a nonhuman intelligence."
_ROBY
"If there is some kind of alien intelligence down on that planetoid, it'd be a serious mistake for us to blunder in unequipped."
_BROUSSARD
"Hell, we're equipped --"
_ROBY
"Hell, no! We don't know what's down there on that piece of rock! It might be dangerous! What we should do is get on the radio to the exploration authorities... and let them deal with it."
_STANDARD
"Except it will take"
years to ge a reply back. Don't forget how far we are from the Colonies, Martin."
_BROUSSARD
"There are no commercial lanes out here. Face it, we're out of range."
_MELKONIS
"Men have waited centuries to contact another form of intelligent life in the universe. This is an opportunity which may never come again."
_ROBY
"Look --"
_STANDARD
"You're overruled, Martin. Gentlemen -- let's go."
INTERIOR - BRIDG he men are strapping in, but this time it is with grim determination.
_STANDARD
"Dell, I want greater magnification. More surface detail. I want to see what this place looks like."
_BROUSSARD
"I'll see what I can do."
He jabs his controls. The image on the screen ZOOMS DOWN TOWARD TH LANET; but all detail quickly vanishes into a featureless grey haze.
_STANDARD
"It's out of focus."
_ROBY
"No -- that's atmosphere. Cloud layer."
_MELKONIS
"My God, it's stormy for a piece of rock that size!"
_ROBY
"Just a second."
(punches buttons)
"Those aren't water vapor clouds; they have no moisture content."
_STANDARD
"Put ship in atmospheric mode."
EXTERIOR - "SNARK" - OUTER SPAC he great dish antenna on the SNARK folds down against the main bod f the ship, and other parts flatten out, until the ship has assume n aerodynamic form NTERIOR - BRIDGE
_STANDARD
"Dell, set a course and bring us in on that beam."

_STANDARD
"Activate lifter quads."
_BROUSSARD
"Activated. Vertical drop checked. Correcting course. On tangential course now, orbiting."
(brief pause as he
 studies his instruments)
"Crossing the terminator. Entering night side."
EXTERIOR - "SNARK" - IN ORBI eneath the orbiting SNARK, night's curtain rolls across the planet escending at an angle, the SNARK drops down into the thick atmospher f the planetoid NTERIOR - BRIDGE
_ROBY
"Atmospheric turbulence. Dust storm."

"Turn on navigation lights."
EXTERIOR - "SNARK ydroplaning down through the pea-soup atmosphere, a set of brillian ights switches on, cutting through the dust, but hardly improvin isibility NTERIOR - BRIDGE
_BROUSSARD
"Approaching point of origin. Closing at 20 kilometers,"
and slowing Ten. Five. Gentlemen, we are directly above the source of the transmission."
_STANDARD
"What's the terrain down there?"
_BROUSSARD
"Well, line of sight is impossible due to dust. Radar gives me noise. Sonar gives me noise. Infrared -- noise. Let's try ultraviolet. There. Flat. It's totally flat. A plain."
_STANDARD
"Is it solid?"
_BROUSSARD
"It's... basalt. Rock."
_STANDARD
"Then take her down."
_BROUSSARD
"Drop begins... now! Fifteen kilometers and dropping... twelve...  ten... eight and slowing. Five. Three. Two. One kilometer and slowing. Lock tractor beams."
There is a LOUD ELECTRICAL HUM and the ship shudders.
_ROBY
"Locked."
_BROUSSARD
"Kill drive engines."
The engines fall silent.
_ROBY
"Engines off."
_BROUSSARD
"Nine hundred meters and dropping. 800. 700. Hang on gentlemen."
EXTERIOR - SURFACE OF PLANET - NIGH he night-shrouded surface is a hell of blowing dust. The SNARK hover bove it on glowing beams of light, dropping down slowly anding struts unfold like insect legs NTERIOR - BRIDGE
_BROUSSARD
"And we're... down."
EXTERIOR - SURFACE OF PLANET - NIGH he ship touches down, heavily; it rocks on huge shock absorbers NTERIOR - BRIDG he whole ship VIBRATES VIOLENTLY FOR AN INSTANT -- then all th anels in the room flash simultaneously and the LIGHT'S GO OUT.
_BROUSSARD
"Jesus Christ!"
The lights come back on again.
_STANDARD
"What the hell happened?"
_ROBY
(hits a switch)
"Engine room, what happened?"
_FAUST
(over, filtered)
"Just a minute, hold it, I'm checking."
_ROBY
"Has the hull been breached?"
_BROUSSARD
"Uh... "
(scans his gauges)
"No, I don't see anything. We've still got pressure."
There is a BEEP from the communicator. Then:
_FAUST
(over, filtered)
"Martin, this is Jay. The intakes are clogged with dust. We overheated and burned out a whole cell."
_STANDARD
(strikes his panel)
"Damn it! How long to fix?"
_ROBY
(into microphone)
"How long to fix?"
_FAUST
(over, filtered)
"Hard to say."
_ROBY
"Well, get started."
_FAUST
(over, filtered)
"Right. Talk to you."
_STANDARD
"Let's take a look outside. Turn the screens back on."
Melkonis hits buttons. The screens flicker, but remain black.
_BROUSSARD
"Can't see a blessed thing."
EXTERIOR - SHIP - NIGH nly a few glittering lights distinguish the ship from the absolut arkness around it HE WIND MOANS AND SCREAMS. DUST BLOWS IN FRONT OF THE TINY GLIMMERIN IGHTS NTERIOR - BRIDGE - NIGHT

"Kick on the floods."
EXTERIOR - SHIP - NIGH  ring of FLOODLIGHTS on the ship come to life, pouring blinding ligh ut into the night hey illuminate nothing but a patch of featureless grey ground an louds of blowing dust. The wind shrieks NTERIOR - BRIDGE - NIGHT
_ROBY
"Not much help."
Standard stares at the dark screens.
_STANDARD
"Well, we can't go anywhere in this darkness. How long till dawn?"
_MELKONIS
(consults his instruments)
"Well... this rock rotates every two hours. The sun should be coming up in about 20 minutes."
_BROUSSARD
"Good! Maybe we'll be able to see something then."
_ROBY
"Or something will be able to see us."
They all look at him.

The men (Standard, Roby, Broussard, an elkonis) are sitting and standing around the room, drinking coffe nd staring at the screens, which reveal only the billowing dust.
_ROBY
"There could be a whole city out there and we'd never see it."
_BROUSSARD
"Not sitting on our butts in here, that's for sure."
_STANDARD
"Just settle down. Sandy, you get any response yet?"
_MELKONIS
(pulls off his earphones)
"Sorry. Nothing but that same damn transmission, every"
seconds. I'v tried every frequency on the spectrum."
_BROUSSARD
"Are we just going to sit around and wait for an invitation?"
Roby gives Broussard a black look, then stabs a button on his consol nd speaks into the mike.
_ROBY
(into mike)
"Hello, Faust!"
_FAUST
(over, filtered)
"Yeah!"
_ROBY
"How's it coming on the engines?"
INTERIOR - ENGINE ROO aust is seated at an electronic workbench, brightly lit, speakin nto a wall intercom.
_FAUST
"I never saw anything as fine as this dust... these cells are all pitted on a microscopic level. I have to polish these things smooth again, so it's going to take a while. Okay?"
INTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY
_ROBY
"Yeah, okay."
(puts down the mike)
_STANDARD
"Sandy... how far are we from the source of the transmission?"
_MELKONIS
"Source of transmission is to the northeast... about 300 meters."
_ROBY
"Close... "
_BROUSSARD
"Close enough to walk to!"
_STANDARD
"Martin, would you run me an atmospheric?"
_ROBY
(punches buttons and
 consults his panels)
"10% argon, 85% nitrogen, 5% neon...  and some trace elements."

"Nontoxic... but unbreathable. Pressure?"
_ROBY
"Ten to the fourth dynes per square centimeter."
_STANDARD
"Good! Moisture content?"
_ROBY
"Zero. Dry as a bone."
_STANDARD
"Any microorganisms?"
_ROBY
"Not a one. It's dead."
_STANDARD
"Anything else?"
_ROBY
"Yeah, rock particles. Dust."
_STANDARD
"Well, we won't need pressure suits, but breathing masks are called for. Sandy -- can you rig up some kind of portable unit that we can use to follow that transmission to its source?"
_MELKONIS
"No problem."
_BROUSSARD
"I volunteer for the exploration party."
_STANDARD
"I heard you. You want to break out the side arms?"
INTERIOR - MAIN ARM LOCK - DA tandard, Broussard and Melkonis enter the lock. They all wear gloves oots, jackets, and pistols roussard touches a button and the inner door slides silently shut ealing them into the lock hey all pull on rubber full-head oxygen masks.
_STANDARD
(adjusting the radio on his
 mask)
"I'm sending. Do you hear me?"
_BROUSSARD
"Receiving."
_MELKONIS
"Receiving."
_STANDARD
"All right. Now just remember: keep away from those weapons unless I say otherwise. Martin, do you read me?"
INTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY
_ROBY
"Read you, Chaz."
INTERIOR - MAIN AIR LOCK - DAY
_STANDARD
"Open the outer door."
Ponderously, the outer lock door slides open. ORANGE SUNLIGHT stream nto the lock, and clouds of dust swirl in. We hear the MOANING OF TH IND OUTSIDE  mobile stairway slides out of the open hatchway, and clunks as i its the ground tandard walks out into the storm, followed by the others XTERIOR - PLANETOID - DA he three men trot down the gangplank to the surface of the planet heir feet sink into a thick layer of dust and loose rock he men huddle together, looking around. The wind screams and tugs a heir clothes. Nothing can be seen.
_STANDARD
"Which way, Sandy?"
Melkonis is fiddling with a portable direction-finder.
_MELKONIS
(pointing)
"That way."
_STANDARD
"You lead."
Melkonis walks into the blinding dust clouds, followed closely by th thers.
_STANDARD
"Okay, Martin. We're on our way."
INTERIOR - BRIDGE - DA oby is the sole occupant of the bridge. He is huddled over hi onsole, smoking a cigarette and watching three moving blips on  creen.
_ROBY
"Okay, Chaz, I hear you. I've got you on my board."
_STANDARD
(over, filtered)
"Good. I'm getting you clear too. Let's just keep the line open."
EXTERIOR - PLANETOID - DA he three men plough their way through a limbo of yellow dust an hrieking wind. With their rubbery masks and deliberate movements hey look like deep-sea divers at the bottom of a murky ocean elkonis leads the column, following the compass on the directio inder.
_STANDARD (CONT'D)
"Can't see more than three meters in any direction out here. We're walking blind, on instruments."
They wade on, following Melkonis. Abruptly he halts.
_STANDARD (CONT'D)
"What's wrong?"
_MELKONIS
"My signal's fading."
He studies the direction finder NTERIOR - BRIDGE - DA oby is listening intently to the dialogue from the helmet radios.
_MELKONIS (CONT'D)
(over, filtered)
"It's the dust, it's interfering... "
His concentration is so great that he does NOT NOTICE HUNTER COMING U EHIND HIM.
_MELKONIS (CONT'D)
(over, filtered)
 ... Hold it, I've got it again. It's
"over that way."
Standing DIRECTLY BEHIND ROBY, Hunter speaks.
_HUNTER
"What's happening?"
Startled out of his wits, Roby GASPS and whirls around to face Hunter.
_ROBY
(startled silly)
"Hell!"
Hunter stares at Roby, whose momentary terror dissolves int mbarrassed anger XTERIOR - PLANETOID - DA he three men push their way through the storm. Melkonis stops again tudies the direction finder.
_MELKONIS
"It's close, real close."
_STANDARD
"How far?"
_MELKONIS
"We should be almost on top of it. I just can't quite... "
Suddenly, Broussard grabs Standard's arm and points. The others star n the direction he is pointing EVERSE ANGLE - THEIR POINT-OF-VIE hrough the dense clouds of swirling dust we can just barely make ou ome kind of HUGE SHAPE s we watch, the dust clears slightly, REVEALING A GROTESQUE SHI ISING FROM THE SHIP LIKE SOME GIGANTIC TOADSTOOL. It is clearly o on-human manufacture NGLE ON THE ME hey are struck dumb by the sight of the craft. Finally, Standar inds his voice.
_STANDARD
"Martin, uh, we've found it."
_ROBY
(sharply -- over, filtered)
"Found what?"
_STANDARD
"It appears to be some sort of spacecraft. We're going to approach it."
They start toward the alien ship NTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY
_STANDARD (CONT'D)
(over, filtered)
"There are no signs of life. No lights... no movement... "
Roby and Hunter are listening with hypnotic concentration.
_STANDARD (CONT'D)
(over, filtered)
"We're, uh, approaching the base."
EXTERIOR - BASE OF TOADSTOOL SHIP - DA  strangely shaped DOOR yawns open at the base of the ship. Dust an and have blown in, filling the lower part of the entrance ith great caution, the men approach the entrance and group around it.
_STANDARD (CONT'D)
"Appears to be a door hanging open, the entrance is clogged with debris."
_BROUSSARD
"Looks like a derelict."
_STANDARD
"Martin, we're going in. I'm going to hold the conversation to a minimum from here on."
INTERIOR - ALIEN SHIP - DA he doorway is a glowing geometric blur of light against blackness pewing dust. In the darkness of the chamber are huge, formles hapes tandard, Broussard and Melkonis appear silhouetted against th oorway. They switch on flashlight-like devices called "DATASTICKS" nd step in.

Carefully, peering around, they pick their way past the indistinc achinery.
_MELKONIS
"Air lock?"
_STANDARD
"Who knows?"
_BROUSSARD
"Let's try and find the control room."
As they move their lights around, they can see that the walls eiling, and machinery are FULL OF HUGE, IRREGULAR HOLES.
_MELKONIS
"Look at these holes. This place looks like Swiss cheese."
Broussard shines his light up into a huge hole in the ceiling.
_BROUSSARD
"This hole goes up several decks -- looks like somebody was firing a military disintegrator in here."
They all peer up the hole into darkness.
_STANDARD
"Climbing gear."
Standard draws out a stubby spear gun with a graplon attached to it e aims it up into the hole and fires he graplon is launched up into darkness, trailing a thin wire. Ther s a dull CLUNK, and the wire dangles.
_BROUSSARD
"I'll go first."
_STANDARD
"No, you'll follow me."
Standard attaches the wire to a powered gear box on his chest, an resses a button. With a mechanical whine, he is pulled up into th ole, using his feet for leverage where he can roussard attaches the wire to his own chest unit NTERIOR - CONTROL ROOM OF ALIEN SHI his chamber is totally dark as Broussard arrives at the top of th ole tandard stands with his flashlight/camera ("datastick") tracing  eam through the hanging dust roussard unclips himself from the climbing wire, then raises his ow ight. At that moment, Melkonis arrives at the top of the hole HEIR LIGHTS SCAN THE ROOM. The beams are clearly visible as column f light in the floating dust. They reveal heavy, odd shapes roussard stumbles over something. He shines his light down on it t is a large, glossy urn, brown in color, with peculiar markings roussard stands it upright. It has a round opening in the top, and i mpty uddenly, Melkonis lets out a grunt of shock. Their lights hav lluminated something unspeakably grotesque: A HUGE ALIEN SKELETON EATED IN THE CONTROL CHAIR hey approach the skeleton, their lights trained on it. IT IS  ROTESQUE THING, BEARING NO RESEMBLANCE TO THE HUMAN FORM.
_MELKONIS
"Holy Christ... "
Standard shines his light on the console at which the hideous skeleto s seated. He moves his light closer and peers at the panel.
_STANDARD
"Look at this... "
They approach.
_STANDARD (CONT'D)
"Something has been scratched here...  into the veneer. See?"
Traced raggedly onto the surface of the panel, as by the point of  harp instrument, is a small triangle:

IMAGE -- scrawledtriangle.jpg

Hearing something, Broussard flashes his light across the room. As th eam scans the walls, it briefly touches on SOMETHING THAT MOVES elkonis convulsively yanks out his pistol.
_MELKONIS
"LOOK OUT, IT MOVED!"
Standard knocks his hand down.
_STANDARD
"Keep away from that gun!"
Standard shoulders himself in front of the others. Then, slowly, h egins to move toward the far side of the room hey approach a console on the wall, training their lights on it here is a machine. On the machine, a small bar moves steadily bac nd forth, sliding noiselessly in its grooves.
_STANDARD (CONT'D)
"Just machinery."
_BROUSSARD
"But functioning."
Melkonis looks down at his direction finder.
_MELKONIS
"That's where the transmission is coming from."
He throws a switch on the direction finder -- with a crackle and  um, the UNEARTHLY VOICE fills their earphones.
_BROUSSARD
"A recording. A damned automatic recording."

"The way I figure it, they landed here for repairs or something, then they couldn't take off again. Maybe the dust ruined their engines. They set up an S.O.S. beacon, but nobody came. So they died."

"Jay, we've got a problem. I was wondering if there was any way you could shortcut the repairs and give us immediate takeoff capability."
_FAUST

"Why, what's wrong?"
_ROBY
"The computer's translated the alien signal, and it's kind of alarming."
_FAUST
"What do you mean?"

Row after row of pictograms stretc rom floor to ceiling, some epic history in an unknown language. Hug eligious symbols dominate one wall paced at intervals are stylized stone statues, depicting grotesqu onsters, half anthropoid, half octopus.
_BROUSSARD
"It's unbelievable! It's like some kind of tomb... some primitive religion! Hey, is anybody there? Do you read me? Standard!"

They all have sealed lids. H hines his light on one of them; then he lays his gloved hand on it e lifts his mask radio to his lips.
_BROUSSARD
"I don't know if you can hear me, but the place is full of large bottles or jars, just like the one we found on the other ship -- except these are all sealed. Also they're soft to the touch."

"No, I told him to be out in ten minutes. It's been much longer. Let's get him out of there."
Standard pulls himself up and crouches precariously on the edge of th unnel. He begins to fiddle with the winch mechanism from whic roussard's line dangles.
_STANDARD (CONT'D)
"The line's slack. Christ, do you think the idiot unhooked himself?"
He switches on the winch motor. With a whine, it begins to reel th ine in. After a moment, the line TIGHTENS WITH A JERK -- and th otor slows down, laboring under the added weight.

Standard punches some buttons, and on the monitors, a kind of X-ra mage in vivid colors appears, depicting Broussard's HEAD AND UPPE ORSO he parasite is clearly visible on Broussard's face. In X-ray, th reature is a maze of complicated biology. But the shocking thing i hat, in X-ray, we can see that Broussard's jaws are forced wide open nd THE PARASITE HAS EXTRUDED SOME KIND OF LONG TUBE, WHICH IS STUFFE NTO HIS MOUTH AND DOWN HIS THROAT, ending near his stomach.
_ROBY
"Look at that."
_HUNTER
"What is it -- I can't tell anything --"
_ROBY
"It's some kind of organ -- it's inserted some kind of tube or something down his throat."
_HUNTER
(turning sick)
"Oh... God... "
Hunter bends over and RETCHES.
_ROBY
"I think that's how it's getting oxygen to him."
_HUNTER
"It doesn't make any sense. It paralyzes him... puts him into a coma... then keeps him alive."
_MELKONIS
"We can't expect to understand a life form like this. We're out of our back yard. Things are different here."
_HUNTER
"Well, can't we kill it? I mean, we can't leave the damn thing on him."
_MELKONIS
"We don't know what might happen if we tried to kill it. At least right now it's keeping him alive."
_HUNTER
"How about cutting it off? We can't pull it loose, but we can cut off everything but the bottom layer, where it's stuck to his face."
_STANDARD
"You're right... we can't stand here and do nothing."
Standard picks up his dusty breathing mask and pulls it over his head hen he pulls back on his bulky gloves. Finally, he presses a switc nd Broussard slides back out of the booth.
_STANDARD (CONT'D)
(muffled in his mask)
"Somebody give me a scalpel."
Melkonis takes a glittering surgical blade from a slot in the wall nd carefully passes it to Standard lumsily because of the gloves, Standard manipulates the knife in hi and till he has a decent grip on it. Then he flicks a little butto ith his thumb. The scalpel begins to hum tandard advances on the parasite. The others draw back nervously oby reaches over and draws yet a longer blade from the rack, an olds it inconspicuously at his side tandard bends over the parasite. Carefully, he touches the scalpel t he extreme end of one of the tentacles, where it curves toward th ack of Broussard's head ffortlessly, the electronic blade slides through the alien tissue mmediately, a urine-like fluid begins to flow from the wound.
_STANDARD (CONT'D)
(muffled)
"I've made an incision... it's not reacting... but some kind of yellowish fluid is leaking out of the wound... "
The noxious-looking liquid drips down onto the bedding next t roussard's head. Instantly, it starts to hiss, and a thin stream o moke curls up from the stain.
_STANDARD (CONT'D)
(muffled)
"Hold it, this stuff's smoking!"
The others REACT nervously y now, the yellow fluid has eaten a hole through the bunk bed and ha ripped down onto the floor below. The metal floor begins to bubbl nd sizzle, and more smoke rises he men start to COUGH.
_MELKONIS
"God, that smoke's poisonous!"
_HUNTER
(pointing)
"It's eating a hole in the floor!"
Abruptly, the men jostle their way out of the room and huddle in th orridor outside, coughing their lungs out tandard, who is masked, remains. Frantically, he attempts to put  andage on the wound, but the fluid instantly melts the bandage, an n the process, some of the stuff gets on Standard's gloves. The egin to smoke rantically Standard leaps back, pulling off the smouldering gloves hen he runs out into the corridor and yanks off his mask NTERIOR - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE INFIRMARY
_STANDARD
"That stuff's eating right through the metal! It's going to eat through the decks and right out through the hull!"
By this time Standard has started to run for the stairs NTERIOR - CORRIDORS IN SHI ollowed by the others, Standard frantically clangs down the stairs t he level below.
_STANDARD
"There! Look!"
A droplet of the fluid is sizzling on the ceiling. It oozes down an rips to the floor t bubbles on the floor.
_MELKONIS
"Jesus, what can we put under it?"
Standard and Hunter charge down the stairs to the level below NTERIOR - LEVEL BELO tandard and Hunter move cautiously down the corridor, looking up a he ceiling.
_STANDARD
(pointing)
"There. Should be coming through about there."
_HUNTER
"Careful, don't get under it!"
INTERIOR - LEVEL ABOV oby and Melkonis crouch by the spot on the floor where the aci izzles.
_MELKONIS
"Christ, that stinks."
Roby fishes a pen out of his pocket and probes into the hole in th loor.
_ROBY
"Seems to have stopped penetrating."
Hunter comes charging up the steps.
_HUNTER
"What's happening up here?"
_ROBY
"I think it's fizzled out."
Hunter approaches and looks. Roby straightens up, starts to put th en back in his pocket, then changes his mind and stands holding it b he end.
_MELKONIS
"I never saw anything like that in my life... except molecular acid."
_HUNTER
"But this thing uses it for blood."
_MELKONIS
"Hell of a defense mechanism. You don't dare kill it."
Standard comes up the stairs.
_STANDARD
"It's stopped?"
_MELKONIS
"Yes, thank heaven."
_STANDARD
"We're just plain lucky. That could have gone right through the hull -- taken weeks to patch it."
_MELKONIS
"Reminded me of when I was a kid and the roof leaked -- everybody running for the pots and pans."
_ROBY
"My God, what about Broussard?"
They turn and run up the stairs NTERIOR - INFIRMAR hey all come into the room (Roby carrying the partially melted pen) roussard is still motionless on the bunk, with the thing on his face.
_ROBY
"Did it get on him?"
Standard approaches and peers at Broussard's head.
_STANDARD
"No, thank God... just missed him."
_MELKONIS
"Is it still dripping?"
_STANDARD
(examining it)
"It appears to have healed itself."
_HUNTER
"It makes me sick to see him like that."
_MELKONIS
"Isn't there some way we can get it off him?"
_STANDARD
"I don't see how. But let's do what we can for him."
Standard presses a button, and Broussard slides back into th iagnostic coffin. He presses more buttons, and the displays light u gain, showing different parts of Broussard's body.
_STANDARD (CONT'D)
"I think we'd better get some intravenous feeding started. God knows what that thing is leaching out of him."
Standard operates some controls, and the machine begins to invad roussard's body, sliding needles into him.
_ROBY
(studying the screens)
"Look there, what's that stain on his lungs?"
The X-ray reveals a spreading dark blot in the vicinity of Broussard' hest. In the center, the stain is completely opaque.
_MELKONIS
"It appears to be a heavy fluid of some sort... it blocks the X-rays... "
_ROBY
"That tube must be depositing it in him."
_MELKONIS
"Could be some kind of venom, or poison... "
_HUNTER
"This is horrible."
_ROBY
"Hey! what about the film?"
_STANDARD
"What film?"
_ROBY
"Broussard had film in his datastick, didn't he? We can see what happened to him."
INTERIOR - MULTI-PURPOSE ROO gain we are watching slides in the darkened room. This time Standard oby, Melkonis, and Hunter are watching the sequence of photograph aken automatically by Broussard's datastick as he probed the tomb he camera reveals the "urns." The climax of the sequence of still omes when THE CREATURE LEAPS OUT OF THE "URN" TOWARD THE CAMERA - nd after that the camera drops to a useless angle and proceeds t how a series of meaningless blurs. Then the reel ends.
_HUNTER
"That must have been when he got it."
_ROBY
"The same thing must've happened to the creatures on the other ship...  except they took one of those jars on board, and opened it there."
_MELKONIS
(clicks back through the
 slides to a picture of
 one of the "urns")
"At first I thought they were jars too, or artifacts anyway. But they're not. They're eggs, or spore casings. Let's go back to the heiroglyphics."
CLICKETYCLICKETYCLICK -- Melkonis accelerates through the slides in  lur, stopping at the one he wants -- which shows a strip o eiroglyphs on the wall of the tomb.
_STANDARD
"I personally can't make any sense out of it... "
CLICK. CLICK. Melkonis is changing the slides as they talk, showin ifferent angles on the glyphs.
_MELKONIS
"It's a crude symbolic language -- looks primitive."
_HUNTER
"You can't tell -- that kind of stuff could represent printed circuits... "
_STANDARD
"That sounds a little fanciful... "
_MELKONIS
"Primitive pictorial languages are based on common objects in the environment, and this can be used as a starting point for translation... "
_ROBY
"What common objects?"
_HUNTER
"Listen, hadn't somebody better check on Broussard?"
_STANDARD
(rising)
"I'll do it. The rest of you continue."
_HUNTER
(rising)
"I'll come with you."
INTERIOR - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE INFIRMAR tandard and Hunter come down the passageway.
_STANDARD
"You know, it's fantastic -- the human race has gone this long without ever encountering another advanced life form, and now we run into a veritable zoo."
_HUNTER
"What do you mean?"
_STANDARD
"Well, those things out there aren't the same, you know -- the spaceship and the pyramid. They're from different cultures and different races. That ship just landed here -- crashed like we did. The pyramid and the thing from it are indigenous."
_HUNTER
"How could anything be indigenous to this asteroid? It's dead."
_STANDARD
"Maybe it wasn't always dead."
They arrive at the infirmary NTERIOR - INFIRMAR he door slides open, and they step into the room. Hunter activate he bed, and it slides out of the wall HERE IS A LONG, HORRIFIED PAUSE.
_HUNTER
"It's gone."
They rush to Broussard's prone form. THE PARASITE IS GONE FROM HI ACE roussard is still unconscious, but he is breathing. HIS FACE I OVERED WITH SUCKER MARKS.
_HUNTER
"Now we're in for it."
_STANDARD
"The door was closed. It must still be in here."
They immediately grow very tense. Hunter starts edging toward th oor. Standard grabs his arm.
_STANDARD (CONT'D)
"No, don't open the door. We don't want it escaping."
_HUNTER
(very nervous)
"Well, what the hell good can we do in here? We can't grab it -- it might jump on us --"
_STANDARD
"Maybe we can catch it."
Standard picks up a stainless steel tray with a lid.
_STANDARD (CONT'D)
"As long as we're careful not to damage it... "
Tray in one hand, lid in the other, Standard begins moving slowl round the room. There are very few places to hide e bends down and peers under the bunk s he is down on his hands and knees, WE SEE ONE TENTACLE OF TH HING, VIBRATING ON A LEDGE JUST ABOVE STANDARD e rises, and HIS SHOULDER BRUSHES THE TENTACLE. THE PARASITE DROPS T HE FLOOR.
_STANDARD
(leaping back)
"Shit!"
But the thing is not moving. It lies motionless on the floor, it entacles curled up. Its color has faded to a dead-looking grey ithout taking his eyes off the thing, Standard reaches behind him an akes a long probe from the wall. He prods the thing; it does no espond.
_STANDARD (CONT'D)
"I think it's dead."
With great care, he uses the probe to fish the motionless parasit nto the tray. Then he quickly closes the lid NTERIOR - LABORATOR tandard, Roby, and Melkonis have the parasite spread-eagled on  tainless steel table, with a bright light on it. It is belly-side up earing gloves, Standard probes at the thing with an instrument.
_STANDARD
"Look at these suckers -- no wonder we couldn't get it off him."
_ROBY
"Is that its mouth?"
_MELKONIS
"More likely that organ -- the tube- like thing -- fits up in there."
With a pair of needle-nosed pliers, Standard fishes in the flesh perture. Carefully, he extracts the end of the tube-organ.
_ROBY
"Ugh."
Suddenly, it starts to FALL APART IN THE PLIERS.
_STANDARD
"Quick -- it's decomposing -- gimme something to grab it with!"
It begins to SMOKE AND BUBBLE oby grabs a long pair of tongs from the wall and thrusts them a tandard -- who throws down the pliers, snatches the tongs and seize he thing in the tongs t is smouldering and dripping acid on the floor.
_STANDARD (CONT'D)
"Christ! Let's get it out of here!"
Carrying the thing, he heads for the door NTERIOR - CORRIDORS IN SHI he men run down the passageways, Standard carrying the dripping thin n the tongs. It leaves little smoking droplets on the floor NTERIOR - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE AIR LOC hey come running up to the airlock. Roby stabs the button and th nner door slides open. By the time Standard is in the lock, Roby i lready on the intercom:
_ROBY
(shouts into intercom)
"For Chrissake, open the main lock!"
INTERIOR - AIR LOCK - DA oby stumbles in as the inner door closes; and with a heavy whine, th hick surface door rumbles open. Orange sunlight billows in, followe y the inevitable dust tandard HURLS THE CARCASS OUT, tongs and all XTERIOR - BASE OF SHIP - DA he parasite hits the ground and begins to sink into the dust mouldering and fuming NTERIOR - AIR LOCK - DA he outer door rolls shut.
_ROBY
(slumping against the
 wall)
"My God, it's lethal even when it's dead!"
Melkonis gets down on his knees and studies the small burn-holes i he floor tandard opens the inner door and steps out into the corridor. There e activates the wall intercom and punches out a combination NTERIOR - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE AIR LOCK
_HUNTER
(over intercom,
 filtered)
"Yes?"
_STANDARD
"How's Broussard?"
_HUNTER
(over, filtered)
"He's running a fever."
_STANDARD
"Still unconscious?"
_HUNTER
(over, filtered)
"Yes."
_STANDARD
"Can you do anything for him?"
_HUNTER
(over, filtered)
"The machine will bring his temperature down. His vital functions are strong."
_STANDARD
"Good."
He switches off the intercom.
_STANDARD (CONT'D)
(suddenly exhausted)
"I need some coffee."
He turns and walks away NTERIOR - MULTI-PURPOSE ROO he cat is strolling around as Roby and Melkonis drop into seats tandard draws a cup of coffee from the machine.
_MELKONIS
"These day and night cycles are totally disorienting. I feel like we've been here for days, but it's only been how long?"
_ROBY
(stroking the cat)
"About four hours."
_STANDARD
(staring into his coffee
 cup)
"I'm sorry to say it looks like you were right in the first place, Martin. We never should have landed here."
_ROBY
"Look, I'm not trying to rub anybody's nose in anything. The important thing is just to get away from here as fast as possible."
_STANDARD
"I can't lean on Faust any harder -- he's been working non-stop on the engines."
_ROBY
"If we knew exactly what happened to the beings on the other ship --"
_MELKONIS
"We do know that."
_ROBY
"Yeah?"
_MELKONIS
"They never made it off the planet. The parasites won."
This brings a CHILLY SILENCE.
_ROBY
"Where did the parasites come from?"
_STANDARD
"They seem native to the planet. It's got an atmosphere and a dense gravity. It's dead now, but once it must have been fertile."
_MELKONIS
"No. It's just too small to support fauna as big as the parasites. If there were a native ecology, it would have to be microscopic."
_ROBY
"Couldn't the pyramid have been built here by space travellers?"
_STANDARD
"Too primitive. It's a pre- technological construction. That slab was engineered by an Iron-Age culture at best."
_MELKONIS
"They're from a dead civilization; they're spores from a tomb. God knows how long they've been here."
_ROBY
"I think we better take another look at those heiroglyphs."
Suddenly the door opens and Faust sticks his head in. He is covere ith dirt and grime.
_FAUST
"Hey, guess what?"
_STANDARD
"What?"
_FAUST
"The engines are fixed."
EXTERIOR - PLANETOID - DA he SNARK's engines cough and then with a ROAR BEGIN TO BELCH OU TREAMS OF SUPERHEATED AIR, cutting through the tulgy dust he ship roars and vibrates like a huge beast, capable of unlimite ower NTERIOR - BRIDGE - DA hey are all at their posts.
_STANDARD
"Switch on tractor beams."
There is a hair-tingling ELECTRICAL HUM which permeates the whol hip, and it begins to float, like a cork in water.
_STANDARD (CONT'D)
"Lock tractor beams."
The pitch of the hum changes, and the ship levels itself.
_STANDARD (CONT'D)
"Retract landing struts."
EXTERIOR - SHIP - DA he ship is hovering above the ground on beams of shimmering force he landing struts fold up under the belly of the ship NTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY
_STANDARD
"Take us up."
_ROBY
(into intercom)
"Up one kilometer, Jay."
EXTERIOR - PLANETOID - DA he SNARK begins to levitate up into the sky, on the beams of light NTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY
_STANDARD
"Switch on lifter quads."
A POWERFUL, DEEP THROBBING BEGINS. THE SHIP VIBRATES XTERIOR - "SNARK" - DA he hovering SNARK begins to accelerate through the chokin tmosphere NTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY
_STANDARD
"Engage artificial gravity."
Roby throws a switch, and the ship LURCHES.
_ROBY
"Engaged."
_STANDARD
"Let's take her into an escape orbit."
The men get busy with switches.
_ROBY
"I'm altering our vector now; should give us an easy escape velocity --"
A HUGE TREMOR RUNS THROUGHOUT THE SHIP.
_ROBY & MELKONIS
(in concert)
"What was that?"
In answer, THE COMMUNICATOR BEEPS.
_FAUST
(over, filtered)
"This dust is getting clogged in the intakes again!"
_STANDARD
"Just hold us together till we're in space, that's all!"
The pitch of the engines changes, deepens XTERIOR - SKY - DA he SNARK swoops up at an acute angle into the boiling clouds isibility is zero NTERIOR - ENGINE ROO aust is pulling on a gasmask, because the engine chamber is beginnin o fill with dust. He turns on a huge exhaust unit which begins t uck up some of the dust NTERIOR - BRIDGE - DA n the screens, nothing but clouds. Then, ANOTHER TREMOR SHUDDER HROUGH THE SHIP. The men no longer speak; their expressions are grim et, and sweating; they are watching their instruments. Periodicall hey mutter technical instructions to each other XTERIOR - SHIP - DA bruptly the ship CLEARS THE TOP OF THE CLOUD LAYER AND BURSTS OU NTO STAR-SPRINKLED SPACE, trailing a wake of dust behind it NTERIOR - BRIDGE - OUTER SPAC hey all CHEER.
_ROBY
(pounds his panel)
"We made it! Damn, we made it!"
_STANDARD
"You bet we made it. Martin, set course for Irth and accelerate us into stardrive."
_ROBY
"With great pleasure."
Roby begins to punch buttons.
_MELKONIS
"I feel like an escapee from Hell."
_DISSOLVE TO:
EXTERIOR - SHIP AT LIGHT SPEED - LATE he ship's speed is so great that there is perceptible movement in th niverse all around here is a strange corona effect which causes the stars approachin he ship to appear blue, and the receding ones to be red. This i edshift, made visible because of their incredible velocity NTERIOR - BRIDGE - OUTER SPAC hey are unstrapping.
_ROBY
"That's the part that always makes me feel like I'm gonna puke -- when we accelerate into light speed."
_STANDARD
"Quit complaining; we're in space."
They rise and head out of the room NTERIOR - CORRIDO s they walk along.
_STANDARD
"I think the best thing to do with Broussard is to just freeze him as he is. It'll arrest the progress of his disease, and he can get complete medical attention when we get back to the Colonies."
_ROBY
"We'll have to go into quarantine, maybe for quite a while."
_STANDARD
"That's okay, he can remain in hypersleep until they're ready to treat him."
They enter the infirmary NTERIOR - INFIRMAR s they enter the room, THEY ARE SHOCKED TO SEE BROUSSARD SITTING U n BED -- AWAKE.
_BROUSSARD
(hoarsely)
 ... Mouth's so dry... can I have some
"water... "
Instantly, Roby brings him a plastic cup of water. Broussard gulps i own in a swallow.
_BROUSSARD (CONT'D)
"More."
Roby quickly fills a much bigger container and hands it to Broussard ho greedily consumes the entire thing. Then he sags, panting, on th unk.
_STANDARD
(softly)
"How do you feel, Dell?"
_BROUSSARD
(weakly)
"Wretched. What happened to me?"
_STANDARD
"Don't you remember?"
_BROUSSARD
"Don't remember nothing. Can't hardly remember my name."
_ROBY
"Are you in pain?"
_BROUSSARD
"Not exactly, just feel like somebody's been beating me with rubber hoses for about six years."
Melkonis laughs at this remark. Broussard smiles faintly at him.
_STANDARD
"Hell, you're in great shape, you've got your sense of humor back!"
_BROUSSARD
"God I'm hungry."
_ROBY
"Dell, what's the last thing you can remember?"
_BROUSSARD
 ... I don't know... 
_ROBY
"Do you remember the pyramid?"
_BROUSSARD
"No. Just some horrible dreams about smothering. Where are we?"
_STANDARD
"We're going home. We're in hyperspace."
_MELKONIS
"We're going into the freezers now."
_BROUSSARD
"I'm really starving; can we get some food before we go into the freezers?"
_STANDARD
(laughs)
"I think that's a pretty reasonable request."
INTERIOR - MULTI-PURPOSE ROO he entire crew is seated around the table, eating huge portion reedily. The cat eats from a dish on the table.
_HUNTER
"Boy do I feel a lot better. It's a straight shot back to the Colonies, and then we can start taking bids on the paydirt. Any bets on the top bid?"
_FAUST
(chewing)
"Well, we should at least be able to each buy our own planet."
They all CHUCKLE.
_MELKONIS
"I'm going to write a book about this expedition. I'm going to call it"
 "The Snark Log."
_STANDARD
(stiffly)
"The commander normally has first publication rights."
_MELKONIS
"Maybe we could write it together."
_ROBY
"First thing I'm going to do when we get back is eat some biological food."
_MELKONIS
"What's the matter, you don't like this stuff?"
_ROBY
"Tastes like something you'd feed a chicken to make it lay more eggs."
_STANDARD
"Oh it's okay. I've had better cag than this, but I've had worse too, if you know what I mean."
_FAUST
"I kind of like it."
_ROBY
"You like this shit?"
_FAUST
"It grows on you."
_ROBY
"You know what they make this stuff out of?"
_FAUST
(annoyed)
"Yes, I know what they make it out of, so what? It's food now. You're eating it."
_ROBY
"I didn't say it was bad for you, it's just kind of sickening, that's all."
_HUNTER
"Do we have to talk about this kind of crap at the dinner table?"
Suddenly, unexpectedly, BROUSSARD GRIMACES AND GROANS.
_STANDARD
"What's wrong?"
_BROUSSARD
(his voice straining)
"I don't know... I'm getting these CRAMPS!"
The others stare at him in alarm. Another GROAN is torn from his lips e clutches the edge of the table with his hands, his knuckle hitening.
_STANDARD
"Breathe deeply."
_BROUSSARD
(screaming)
"OH GOD IT HURTS SO BAD!"
_ROBY
"What Dell -- what?"
Broussard's face is screwed up into a mask of agony, and he i rembling violently from head to foot.
_BROUSSARD
(incoherent shriek)
"OhmygooaaAAAHHHHH!!!"
A RED SMEAR OF BLOOD BLOSSOMS ON THE CHEST OF BROUSSARD'S TUNIC HEIR EYES ARE ALL RIVETTED TO BROUSSARD'S CHEST AS THE FABRIC OF HI UNIC IS RIPPED OPEN, AND A HORRIBLE NASTY LITTLE HEAD THE SIZE OF  AN'S FIST PUSHES OUT verybody SCREAMS and leaps back from the table. The cat spits an olts he disgusting little head lunges, comes spurting out of Broussard' hest trailing a thick, wormlike tail -- splattering fluids and bloo - lands in the middle of the dishes and food on the table -- an curries away while the men are stampeding for safe ground hen they finally regain control of themselves, it has escaped roussard lies slumped in his chair, a huge hole in his chest pouting blood. The dishes are scattered and the food is covered wit lood and slime.
_HUNTER
"Oh, no. Oh, no."
_FAUST
"What was that? What the Christ was that?"
_MELKONIS
"It was growing in him the whole time and he didn't even know it!"
Slowly, they gather around Broussard's gutted corpse.
_ROBY
"That thing used him for an incubator!"
EXTERIOR - SHIP - OUTER SPAC  hatch slides open on the side of the ship, and Broussard's wrappe ody tumbles silently out N ELECTRONIC BASS DRUM BEATS A DIRGE as Broussard drifts int ternity NTERIOR - CORRIDOR he entire remaining crew is walking toward the bridge.
_MELKONIS
"We can't go into hypersleep with that thing running around loose."
_HUNTER
"We'd be sitting ducks in the freezers."
_ROBY
"But we can't kill it. If we kill it, it will spill all its body acids right through our hull and out into space."
_FAUST
"Shit... "
_STANDARD
"We'll have to catch it and eject it from the ship."
_MELKONIS
(sighs)
"Well, I kind of hate to point it out, but all our supplies are based on us spending a strictly limited amount of time out of suspended animation... and as you know, we used up most of that time in harvesting."
_STANDARD
"We've got about a week left, right?"
_HUNTER
"And then we run out of food and oxygen."
_FAUST
"The water will still recycle."
_ROBY
"We won't need it then."
_STANDARD
"All right, so that's what we've got. A week. It's plenty of time."
_ROBY
"But if we haven't caught it in a week, then we have to go into the freezers anyway."
They enter the bridge NTERIOR - BRIDGE
_STANDARD
"So does anybody have any suggestions?"
_FAUST
"We could put on our pressure suits and blow all the air out of the ship. That would kill it."
_STANDARD
"No, we can't afford to lose that much oxygen. We're going to have to flush it out."
_MELKONIS
"How?"
_STANDARD
"Room by room, corridor by corridor."
No one likes this thought.
_MELKONIS
"And what do we do when we find it?"
_STANDARD
"We'll have to trap it somehow. If we had a really strong piece of net, we could bag it."
_FAUST
"We could cut a section out of that metallite netting. It won't hold up to that acid, but aside from that it's pretty strong."
_ROBY
"We have to avoid injuring it. What we really need is some electric animal prods."
_HUNTER
"I think I could cobble something together. A long metal rod with a battery in it. Give it a hell of a shock."
_STANDARD
"Good. Get on it. But first, I'm issuing a standing order: from this moment forth, every one of us will wear protective garments, including helmets. Let's get down to the locker and change."
They start for the exit XTERIOR - OUTER SPAC he SNARK continues on its way through the weird vortex of hyperspace NTERIOR - CORRIDORS IN SHI tandard is walking purposefully along the corridor, alone. He i armented in an unusual outfit which makes him look like a rio oliceman, including clear plastic helmet e reaches a corner and turns. But this new passageway has a differen ravity orientation -- Standard seems to be walking down a vertica all e makes yet another disorienting turn, and now he is walking upside own. He reaches a set of steps and climbs up them -- or rather, dow hem NTERIOR - VENTRAL OBSERVATION DOME - VIEW OF OUTER SPAC elkonis is seated in the dome, upside-down, peering down into space e also wears the protective suit tandard, upside-down, climbs into the dome. It is dark and eeri ere, under the stars of interstellar space. A few glowing panel rovide the only illumination.
_STANDARD
"I thought I'd find you here."
_MELKONIS
"I was thinking of a line from an old poem: "Water, water everywhere, but not a drop to drink." All that space out there, and we're trapped in this ship."
_STANDARD
"That's the one about the albatross, right?"
_MELKONIS
"We can't even radio for help; the carrier wave wouldn't reach its destination till long after we'd died and turned to dust. We are utterly, absolutely alone. Can anybody really visualize such a scale of distances? Halfway across Creation... "
_STANDARD
"We came out there, we'll go back. A long time by the clock, but a short time to us."
_MELKONIS
"Time and space have no meaning out here. We're living in Einsteinian equation."
_STANDARD
"I can see you're putting your spare time to good use."
(leans forward and taps
 him on the knee)
"Let me tell you something: you keep staring at hyperspace for long enough, they'll be peeling you off a wall. I've seen it happen."
_MELKONIS
(smiles at him)
"We're the new pioneers, Chaz. We even have our own special diseases."
_STANDARD
"Come on -- let's go above and see how they're coming with the gear."
INTERIOR - BRIDG he whole crew has assembled. Faust is unfolding several yards o himmering metallic netting unter hands out five thin rods, like metal broom handles.
_HUNTER
"These have portable generators in them. They're insulated down to here -- just be careful not to touch the end."
He demonstrates by touching the tip of one of the rods to a meta bject. A blue spark leaps.
_FAUST
"Might even incinerate the damn thing."
_STANDARD
(sharply)
"I hope not."
_HUNTER
"Don't worry, it won't damage it, it'll just give it a little incentive."
_STANDARD
"How do we locate the creature?"
_FAUST
"With these."
He picks up a small portable unit.
_FAUST (CONT'D)
"Tracking device. You set it to search for a moving object... It hasn't got much range, but when you get within a certain distance, it starts beeping."
Standard takes the device and studies it.
_STANDARD
"These will be very useful. At least we won't have to go digging around in closets with our bare hands. All right, here's the battle plan: we're going to break into two teams and start systematically covering the ship. Whoever finds it first, catches it in the net and ejects it from the nearest airlock. Clear?"
_ROBY
"Even simple."
Standard shoots him a vicious look, then continues:
_STANDARD
"For starters, let's make sure the bridge is safe."
Faust takes the device and turns it on. He scans it around the room.
_FAUST
"It's clear."
_STANDARD
"All right -- Roby and Melkonis will go with Faust. Hunter and I will make up the second team."
They start doling out the equipment.
_STANDARD (CONT'D)
"We'll all carry communicators. We want to keep in constant touch."
INTERIOR - CORRIDORS IN SHI elkonis and Roby carry the net, while Faust walks directly behind it arrying the tracking device. He continually scans it from side t ide.
_FAUST
"Nothing yet... nothing... we can move pretty fast as long as there's nothing on the tracker."
INTERIOR - OTHER CORRIDOR tandard and Hunter move silently along. Standard is forced to serve  ouble function, carrying one edge of the net and the tracker as well NTERIOR - CORRIDOR oby's team is moving at a fairly brisk pace, when:
_FAUST
"Hold it."
Faust's tracker is BEEPING, and a small light flashes.
_FAUST (CONT'D)
"I've got something."
Immediately, they grow very tense and start looking around.
_ROBY
"Where's it coming from?"
_FAUST
(peers closely at tracker
 and frowns)
"Machine's screwed up, I can't tell. Needle's spinning all over the dial."
_MELKONIS
"Is it malfunctioning?"
Faust turns the tracker on its side, and the needle stabilizes.
_FAUST
"No, just confused. It's coming from below us."
They all look down at their feet NTERIOR - MAINTENANCE LEVE oby, Melkonis, and Faust come carefully down a set of crude meta tairs, into a drab, functional section of the ship he corridors in this level are lit by rows of bare bulbs in th eiling. The effect is ugly and confining hey stop at the foot of the stairs and move into position, spreadin he net across the corridor.
_ROBY
"Okay."
_FAUST
(looking at tracker and
 nodding down the passageway)
"That way."
They begin to walk down the passageway, footsteps clanging on the ra etal flooring. It is extremely dark.
_ROBY
"What happened to the lights?"
_FAUST
"Bulbs burned out, nobody bothered to replace 'em."
They switch on the helmet lights AMERA FOLLOWS THEM AROUND A COUPLE OF TURNINGS, AND THEN:
_FAUST (CONT'D)
"Hold it."
They all stop quickly, almost stumbling.
_FAUST (CONT'D)
(whispering)
"It's within"
meters.
Roby and Melkonis heft the net, each keeping his prod in hand. Faust rod in one hand and tracker in the other, has the unpleasant job o pproaching the source of the signal e moves with great care, in a half crouch, ready to leap back at an econd, prod extended, constantly glancing at the tracker he tracking device leads him right up to a small hatch or door in on all ehind his plastic mask, sweat is pouring down Faust's face as he set own the tracker and reaches for the little door. He raises the prod rasps the door handle, yanks it open, and jams the electric pro nside ITH A NERVE-SHATTERING SQUALL, A SMALL CREATURE COMES FLYING OUT O HE CABINET, EYES GLARING, CLAWS FLASHING nstinctively, they throw the net over it, but:
_ROBY
(very annoyed)
"Oh, hold it!"
They open the net and release the creature. IT IS THE CAT. Hissing an pitting, it scampers away.
_MELKONIS
"We're making fools of ourselves!"
Roby's COMMUNICATOR BEEPS.
_ROBY
(into communicator)
"Yes!"
_STANDARD
(over, filtered)
"We've got it up here! It's trapped! Get up here fast!"
_ROBY
"Where are you?"
_STANDARD
(over, filtered)
"Food-storage room!"
_ROBY
"We're coming!"
They dash for the stairs NTERIOR - CORRIDORS IN SHI oby, Faust, and Melkonis charge down the hallways until they arriv t NTERIOR - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE FOOD STORAGE ROO tandard and Hunter are waiting for them, in hysterics.
_HUNTER
"We saw it inside and slammed the door on it! It's in there now!"
On the other side of the door, CRASHING AND BANGING can be heard.
_ROBY
"What's it doing, having a seizure?"
_STANDARD
"It started crashing around right after we locked it in."
_ROBY
"Now what?"
_STANDARD
"I guess we open the door and net it."
_HUNTER
"I hate to open that door."
Again the thing can be heard CRASHING AROUND INSIDE.
_STANDARD
"It looks completely different from the first one -- it's more like a worm with legs... and tentacles."
_FAUST
"Well we better do something."
_HUNTER
"Maybe we don't have to. It's trapped in there. We could just leave it in there all the way back to Irth."
_STANDARD
(snaps)
"Don't be an idiot."
_FAUST
"I know what we can do. We can pump poison gas into the room and kill it. Through those ventilator slots there."
He indicates a row of slots in the bottom of the door.
_ROBY
"Hey, wait a minute! That's all our food supplies in there! We can't pump poison gas all over them!"
_STANDARD
"Once we kill the thing we won't need the food any more -- we can go straight into hypersleep. Also, it sounds like that thing is already doing a pretty good job on our supplies; it may be fouling them all."
_ROBY
"You win."
_FAUST
"Somebody gimme a hand, I'll get the stuff."
INTERIOR - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE FOOD LOCKER - LATE AMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL THAT they are fastening a large funnel haped device over the ventilator grill at the bottom of the door his funnel is attached to a thick hose, which runs back to a larg etal tank with pressure gauges.
_STANDARD
"Get those masks on."
They pull on gas masks.
_ROBY
"This stuff's deadly -- I hope we know what we're doing."
_STANDARD
"Go ahead, Jay."
Faust turns on the machine. It begins to throb as it pumps the ga hrough the hose and into the room mmediately, THE CRASHING NOISES RISE IN CRESCENDO, AND THE THING CA E HEARD SCREECHING AND SQUEALING hen the sounds stop altogether.
_STANDARD (CONT'D)
"Shut it off."
Faust shuts off the pump.
_ROBY
"Now what?"
_STANDARD
"What do you think? Now we go in."
Standard steps to the door and opens it. A thick cloud of gas billow ut NTERIOR - FOOD STORAGE ROO he room is thick with the poison gas. The men look like insects i heir gasmasks he food packages are ripped to shreds, and foodstuffs are scattere ll over the floor.
_FAUST
"Looks like he helped himself."
Carefully, the men poke through the garbage, net and prods raised hen Hunter points.
_HUNTER
"God damn it."
They all look where he is pointing. In the wall, A VENTILATOR GRIL AS BEEN RIPPED OPEN.
_HUNTER (CONT'D)
"It escaped."
They move to the shredded ventilator and shine their lights into it.
_ROBY
"Where does that go?"
_FAUST
"All over the ship; we'll have to check the charts to know for sure."
_STANDARD
"Then let's go and do it."
They head for the door.
_HUNTER
"Have we got any food at all left in the ship?"
They slam the door shut and seal it NTERIOR - BRIDG he screens are showing them a schematic of the ship's system o entilator shafts.
_FAUST
"That one section of the ventilator shaft has only two outlets -- you notice? The food storage room on one end --"
_HUNTER
"-- And the cooling unit on the other."
_STANDARD
"So it's trapped in between -- now we have to drive it out."
_FAUST
"Poison gas... "
_HUNTER
"We can't pump poison gas down into the cooling unit! It'll flood the whole ship!"
_STANDARD
"The only other thing I can think of is for somebody to crawl in there and flush it out."
_ROBY
"Are you crazy?"
_STANDARD
"The man would need protection, obviously -- as well as some way to drive the thing before him."
_FAUST
"How about a flamethrower? That wouldn't poison the air."
_MELKONIS
"So one of us goes into the airshaft and drives the thing along --"
_STANDARD
"While the rest of us wait down in the cooling unit with the net."
_HUNTER
"Sounds like a rough one."
_STANDARD
"Got a better idea?"
Hunter shrugs.
_ROBY
"So the only question left is: who gets to crawl down the airshaft?"
_STANDARD
"Let's be democratic."
He tears five small sheets of paper from a pad on his console. On on f them, he draws a large X. Then he wads each piece of paper into  iny little ball e rolls the paperballs between his hands and tosses them on the tabl ike dice.
_STANDARD (CONT'D)
"Martin, take one."
Roby picks one up and unfolds it. It is blank elkonis picks up another and opens it. Again blank aust picks up a ball, and Standard immediately picks his own up. The re both blank hey all look at Hunter, who has not yet unfolded his.
_STANDARD (CONT'D)
"Open it up, Cleave."
INTERIOR - FOOD STORAGE ROO unter is strapping on an oxygen mask and a flame thrower. Faust i elping him inally, Faust hands him a tracking device.
_FAUST
"Well, uh... good luck. I hope you won't need me, but if you do, I'm here."
_HUNTER
(grimly)
"Right."
Hunter turns and climbs into the ventilator opening, which is jus arge enough to crawl through NTERIOR - AIR SHAF t is completely dark in the shaft. Hunter reaches up and turns on hi elmet light. Then he switches on his radio.
_HUNTER
"Hey, do you guys read me down there?"
INTERIOR - CLIMATE CONTROL ROO tandard, Melkonis and Roby are spreading out the net. We hear the hu f huge cooling plants, and their hair ruffles. Large airshafts ru ff in different directions.
_STANDARD
"Yeah, we're getting into position."
INTERIOR - AIR SHAFT
_HUNTER
"Okay, I'm starting now."
He begins to crawl forward into the narrow metal tunnel. He turns  orner fter a couple more tight turns, THE TRACKER SUDDENLY BEEPS unter twitches. He raises his flamethrower and FIRES A BLAST INTO TH ARKNESS. It roars loudly in the confined tube, and the air instantl eats up. Smoke drifts back into his face. He begins to sweat NTERIOR - CLIMATE CONTROL ROO oby points to a large rectangular opening in one wall.
_ROBY
(pointing)
"There. That's where it's got to come out."
He throws a switch, and a large metal panel rises and seals off th pening.
_ROBY (CONT'D)
"That's a flip-flop gate to channel the air, but we can use it to trap the thing."
_STANDARD
"Right now let's keep it closed."
Melkonis is setting up a little portable unit with a screen on it. Th creen shows a section of the ship's schematic.
_MELKONIS
"I've got Hunter... and something else as well, in front of him."
_STANDARD
"Are they close?"
_MELKONIS
"They're on the next level up."
_STANDARD
"Let's get moving with this net."
They lift the net up, holding it in front of the opening NTERIOR - AIR SHAF unter is still crawling on hands and knees. Up ahead, he can see tha he shaft takes an abrupt downward turn e crawls toward the down angle, then fires another blast from hi lamethrower hen he starts crawling down, head first hen he is nearly upside-down, the shaft takes yet another turnin hich puts him into a nearly impossible position, almost immobilized hen the tracker starts BEEPING LIKE CRAZY rantically, he fumbles the flamethrower around, but the space i arrow -- it is difficult maneuvering. He hears a HISSING CRY u head, and claws scrambling on metal hen he has the weapon into position, and sprays another letha laming burst toward the sound NTERIOR - CLIMATE CONTROL ROO elkonis is staring at his screen.
_MELKONIS
"They're getting pretty close now."
_STANDARD
"All right, then -- when it gets to the other side of the door, you sing out, then drop the door. Okay?"
_MELKONIS
"Okay."
_STANDARD
(to Roby)
"And you and I will bag it, and then we'll take it to the ventral air lock, got it?"
_ROBY
(tensely)
"Uh-huh."
INTERIOR - AIR SHAF unter is huddled against a wall of the shaft, clutching th lamethrower.
_HUNTER
(whispers)
"Hey, you guys."
INTERIOR - CLIMATE CONTROL ROOM
_STANDARD
(into communicator)
"Yes!"
INTERIOR - AIR SHAFT
_HUNTER
(whispering)
"I don't think this shaft goes on too much farther... anyway it's getting pretty hot in here... "
INTERIOR - CLIMATE CONTROL ROOM
_STANDARD
(into communicator)
"Okay, our screens show you as being near to the opening. We'll open it up, then we'll cue you and you can start blasting. That'll drive it right out. You don't have to go any farther."
INTERIOR - AIR SHAFT
_HUNTER
"Good."
He readies the flamethrower NTERIOR - CLIMATE CONTROL ROOM
_STANDARD
"Okay, get ready."
He and Roby heft their respective ends of the net, crouched to catc he small creature when it darts out. Melkonis picks up his electri rod.
_STANDARD (CONT'D)
"Open the vent, Sandy."
Melkonis reaches over and throws the switch. The metal gate drop own, opening up the shaft  SIX-FOOT MONSTROSITY STANDS IN THE OPENING. GHASTLY BEYON MAGINATION, SQUAMOUS, COVERED WITH TENTACLES, IT HOPS DOWN LIKE A VER-SIZED BIRD AND GRABS MELKONIS IN RAZOR-SHARP TENTACLES elkonis lets out a horrible shriek, and the thing grabs his head i ne claw and TWISTS IT OFF LIKE A MAN PULLING THE HEAD OFF A CHICKEN HEN THROWS IT TO THE FLOOR WITH AN AUDIBLE CLUNK LUTCHING MELKONIS' BODY TIGHTLY AGAINST ITSELF, IT TURNS AND BOUND OWN THE HALL. MELKONIS' HEADLESS BODY IS STILL KICKING AND STRUGGLIN S THE MONSTER LEAPS HEAD-FIRST INTO ANOTHER AIR SHAFT tandard and Roby are left standing in shock. After a moment, Hunte limbs out of the shaft.
_HUNTER
"What happened? Where is it?"
They break from their paralysis, and run toward the opening th reature just leaped into. It is another shaft, going down int arkness.
_STANDARD
(awed)
"How did it get so big?"
_ROBY
"By eating our food supplies."
_HUNTER
"Where's Melkonis?"
INTERIOR - FOOD STORAGE ROO aust is still waiting.
_FAUST
(into his communicator)
"Hey, are you guys still there? What's going on?"
_STANDARD
(over, filtered)
"Meet us on the bridge. Be careful -- it's huge now."
_FAUST
"Right."
Faust lets himself out of the food storage room and carefully lock he door behind him NTERIOR - CORRIDOR tandard, Roby and Hunter are rapidly ascending toward the bridge.
_HUNTER
"You mean his body was still kicking when it ran off with him?"
_ROBY
"It was horrible -- horrible. Like a chicken."
INTERIOR - BRIDG tandard, Roby and Hunter enter and drop into chairs. Faust follow hortly. They all look blank, stunned.
_FAUST
"What happened? Where's Sandy?"
_ROBY
"Dead."
_FAUST
"Dead!"
_ROBY
"It's monstrous -- it grew, like some horrible tapeworm. We were completely unprepared."
_FAUST
"It's still in the ship?"
_STANDARD
"We'd better seal off the lower maintenance level; at least trap it there."
(throws a switch;
 circuitry lights up)
_HUNTER
"At least it can't get up here now."
_ROBY
"Two down, four to go."
_STANDARD
(angrily)
"What's that supposed to mean?"
_ROBY
"Nothing."
_HUNTER
"Listen, it sure didn't like this flamethrower."
_STANDARD
"That's right -- we can't kill it on the ship, but we can at least keep it at bay -- and maybe drive it into the air lock."
_HUNTER
"Thing is, I'm about out of fuel."
_FAUST
"There's some more combustible fuel down in the storage lockers next to the lounge."
(rises)
"I'll go get it."
_STANDARD
"No, I don't want us separated."
_FAUST
"You just sealed it off; it can't get to that section."
_ROBY
"Don't count on it."
_HUNTER
"We sure need this flamethrower."
_STANDARD
"All right... but do not go below decks."
_FAUST
"Right."
(heads for the door)
_STANDARD
"And be right back."
	Faust exits.
_ROBY
"I think it's time we took a hard look at those heiroglyphs."
Roby begins to punch buttons; the photographs of the heiroglyphic ppear on some of the screens.
_ROBY (CONT'D)
"Can you make out any pattern in all that?"
_STANDARD
(baffled)
"Well... yes... there's a pattern... but it's meaningless to me."
_ROBY
"I know it looks like a senseless jumble, but if you look closely, there are recognizable forms."
_HUNTER
"Recognizable! In that?"
_ROBY
"In symbolic form... very stylized...  but if you stare at it, you can see some of the different creatures we've been dealing with."
_HUNTER
"Well... I suppose that star-shaped thing could be the parasite that got on Broussard. Is that what you mean?"
_ROBY
"And right next to it, that oval design with the markings -- it's a dead ringer for the spore casings."
_STANDARD
"That next thing there -- six legs, tentacles -- that's the thing we saw in the food locker."
_ROBY
"So the next step should be --"
_HUNTER
"-- The big one. And there it is."
Out of meaningless geometric symbols on a wall, it has become possibl o recognize each stage in the alien's life cycle.
_ROBY
"This is all the same creature. We're seeing the different stages in its life-cycle."
_STANDARD
"Then that tomb... must have been some kind of fertility temple... where they stored their eggs, and maybe held mating rituals... "
_HUNTER
 ... And Broussard got caught in their
"reproductive cycle."
_ROBY
"You will notice, though, that there are no more phases. Only four forms are shown. After that the pattern repeats."
_STANDARD
"Which presumably means... "
_ROBY
 ... More spores coming.

_ROBY
"How much oxygen did we lose?"
Standard rises unsteadily and peers at the gauges.
_STANDARD
"We've got six hours left."
_HUNTER
(groans)
"Oh my God."
_STANDARD
"Does anybody know what happened?"
_ROBY
"I saw it. Faust got himself jammed in the air lock door. His body held it open."
_STANDARD
"Can we get to him?"
_ROBY
"No, I had to seal off a whole section. We'd lose too much of our remaining air if we opened the connecting door."

_ROBY

"Poor kitty; puss puss puss."

"At least we're rid of the damn monster. It must have been the first thing sucked out of the ship."
_ROBY
"No such luck. I saw it running down one of the corridors."
_HUNTER
(groans)
"Oh no! We can't fight this thing! There's only six hours of air left -- we're dead men!"
_STANDARD
"I don't buy that. There's still time to destroy it and get ourselves in the freezers."
_HUNTER
"How?"
_STANDARD
"It's time for drastic remedies."
_ROBY
"It was time for that a couple days ago."
_STANDARD
"That kind of remark is pointless. Now come on -- I want to hear every suggestion you can come up with, no matter how wild."
_HUNTER
"We can't kill it on board. It's huge now and must have tremendous amounts of that acid in its body."
_ROBY
"I've got an idea, but you're not going to like it."
_STANDARD
"Let's hear it."
_ROBY
"Okay. First we shut down all the cooling systems on the stardrive engines."
_STANDARD
"That'll blow the ship up."
_ROBY
"Right... but it'll take a few minutes for the engines to overheat and melt down the core. In the meantime, we get in the lifeboat and leave the ship."
_HUNTER
"Blow the ship up?"
_ROBY
"And the creature with it. We can make it back to Irth in the lifeboat."
_STANDARD
"But the lifeboat can't accelerate to light speed."
_ROBY
"Doesn't matter -- we're already at light speed. And when we get back to the Colonies, they'll pick us up in the network."
_HUNTER
"What about all the minerals and elements in the cargo hold? That's the only reason we came out here. We'd have to abandon them all. We'd be broke."
_ROBY
"Our lives are more important. Anyway, we can take a small amount of the most valuable stuff with us on the lifeboat."
_STANDARD
"No, it won't work and I just realized why. There's only one hypersleep freezer on the lifeboat. Only one of us could survive."
_ROBY
"Yeah... I forgot."
_STANDARD
"But the idea's good, if we could just turn it around somehow."
They think.
_STANDARD (CONT'D)
"If we could just get the creature into the lifeboat, we could launch it into space and blow it up."
_HUNTER
"Good! That's good!"
_STANDARD
"We can load the lifeboat up with explosives and trigger them remotely, once the lifeboat is in space."
_ROBY
"I think it's going to be almost impossible to drive it up into the lifeboat."
_HUNTER
"We can use the flamethrower."
_ROBY
"It's not going to work."
_STANDARD
"You can't say that; I think it's a good plan."
_HUNTER
"The flamethrower needs more fuel."
_STANDARD
"Right. We've got a lot to accomplish. Let's get moving."
INTERIOR - MINING & CARGO BA he three men come down steps into this rather dirty area of the ship  lot of tools and large items of machinery are stored around ONG RACKS OF SHELVES ARE STOCKED WITH METAL CONTAINERS OF VARIOU HAPES. Each container is well packed and labelled.
_HUNTER
"Which explosive should we use?"
_STANDARD
"I'd suggest the N-13 sticks. They're portable, and they can be radio detonated."
Hunter begins to unlock a locker and draw out long, red sticks lik roomhandles, with tiny printing on them eanwhile, ROBY IS STARING AT THE ROWS OF METAL CANNISTERS. He touche ne of them.
_ROBY
"You know, it's funny -- this stuff we went to so much trouble to dig up -- this treasure, the paydirt -- it'll make it back to Irth just fine -- even if we're not with it."
_STANDARD
"Here, carry these."
Hunter takes an armload of the red broomsticks, and stumbles.
_ROBY
(grabbing at him)
"Hey watch it!"
_STANDARD
(grinning)
"It's stable; it doesn't hurt to drop it."
They begin to carry the explosives up the steps NTERIOR - CORRIDO he three men are carrying their equipment along the hallway, whe unter's tracker suddenly BEEPS.
_HUNTER
"Hold it!"
They all stop. The tracker BEEPS AGAIN. Hunter puts down his stuff an oints the tracker around.
_HUNTER (CONT'D)
(nodding up some steps)
"Up there."
They all look at each other. Standard puts down his bundle and pick p the flamethrower.
_ROBY
"So what do we do? Do we ignore it and finish loading the explosives into the boat -- or do we flush it out now?"
_STANDARD
"Now. If we can get it into the boat, we won't have to blow it up -- we can just eject it into space."
Standard hefts the flamethrower and starts up the steps NTERIOR - DIM STAIRWEL tandard's face is tense as he advances up the circular steps uddenly, a METALLIC TAPPING SOUND is heard. He freezes hen he continues up XTERIOR - DORSAL OBSERVATION DOME - VIEW OF OUTER SPAC he view of interstellar space is spectacular. As Standard comes u he steps, the METALLIC TAPPING is heard again tandard looks around. Then he sees it -- BROUSSARD'S CORPSE FLOAT UTSIDE THE GLASS OF THE DOME. It is tangled in some rigging, and th ovement of the machinery causes the cadaver to tap on the glas eriodically.
_STANDARD
(shouts)
"You can come up! It's safe!"
The others come up the steps.
_ROBY
(spying the corpse)
"Oh -- Jesus --"
Broussard's corpse is blue and bloated where the wrappings have tor oose. Bumping against the glass, he looks like he wants to come in.
_STANDARD
"The ship's gravitational attraction must have drawn him back."
_HUNTER
(horrified)
"Should we go outside and bring him in?"
_STANDARD
"No... the risk is too great. Perhaps after we've destroyed the thing."
Glancing back, the men retreat from the observation dome. Broussar emains against the glass, peering in with dead eyes NTERIOR - NOSE OF SHI he floor slopes upward slightly here as the corridor funnels in an nds in the entrance to a narrow passageway or crawl-way. Thi assageway connects the nose of the ship with the lifeboat he three men come up to the entrance to the passageway, carrying th quipment. They duck in and walk the short distance to the lifeboat NTERIOR - LIFEBOA he passageway connects into the rear of the lifeboat. It is a xtremely simple, stripped-down vehicle; even the metal struts an eams-are exposed. A single hypersleep freezer takes up a fair amoun f floor space. It is an escape-craft, nothing more.
_STANDARD
(pointing)
"Along the base of the walls there."
They begin to stack the red broomsticks against the base of the wall n both sides of the lifeboat, and to wire them into position tightly.
_HUNTER
"This should do it."
_ROBY
"I should hope so! And we'd better make sure it's pretty far from the ship when we blow it."
_STANDARD
"It will be."
_HUNTER
(surveys the craft uneasily)
"What we really need is some red meat in here for bait."
_ROBY
"Well, if we had some, I'd eat it. I'm starting to get hungry."
By this time, they are exiting NTERIOR - NOSE OF SHIP
_STANDARD
"Well... now we have to herd that thing up here."
_HUNTER
(nervously)
"Whoever's doing the herding is gonna have their hands pretty full. I think somebody should stay by the lifeboat to slam the door on the thing once it's inside, and to serve as... as... "
(searches for a word)
_ROBY
"Isn't "bait" the word you used?"
_HUNTER
"Hey look, somebody has to have his hands free to lock the creature in the lifeboat!"
_STANDARD
"Yes, and maybe launch the boat and blow it too... if the others are injured."
_ROBY
"Who gets the privilege?"
INSERT: THREE CRUMPLED PIECES OF PAPER. Three hands pick them up NGLE ON ROBY. He unfolds his paper, turns it so the others can se t. It has a big X on it NOTHER ANGLE - SHORTLY LATER. Hunter is showing Roby a small devic ike a transistor radio.
_HUNTER
"Just keep your finger off the button till she's way away from the ship, that's all."
_ROBY
"Is it armed?"
_HUNTER
"If you press the button right now, it will blow the whole nose of the ship off."
_ROBY
"Thanks for the thought."
(puts detonator in his
 breast pocket)
_STANDARD
"All right, Martin, we'll be in touch with you on the communicator."
_ROBY
"And you'll let me know when you've got it coming this way... "
_STANDARD
"And you stand aside while we drive it in, then shut the hatch, launch the boat, and --"
_ROBY
"Kablooey."
Hunter's face twitches nervously at this.
_STANDARD
"Come on; we haven't much time, air is a factor."
They leave the nose of the ship, Standard carrying the flamethrower unter the tracker oby settles himself at the controls, runs through them briefly t amiliarize himself. Using a switch, he opens and closes the lifeboa oor a couple of times. It slams open and shut quite rapidly e presses a few buttons and sets the launch button to "READY. hen STANDARD'S VOICE comes from the communicator:
_STANDARD
(over, filtered)
"We've got something on the tracker... got to be it, it's too big for the cat."
This is a VERY SPOOKY SCENE, ROBY ALONE BY THE LIFEBOAT, LISTENING T HE VOICES ON THE COMMUNICATOR.
_HUNTER
(over, filtered)
"It's coming from down there."
Roby hears various tinny sound effects, rustlings, clunkings reathing, etc NTERIOR - CORRIDOR IN SHI tandard has the flamethrower at the ready, and Hunter is staring a he tracker.
_HUNTER
"It must have stopped moving. I'm not getting anything."
_STANDARD
"Let me go first; you stay behind me."
Carefully, Standard advances down the corridor. Then THE CREATURE POP UT OF HIDING BEHIND HUNTER, AND PICKS HIM UP UNTER SCREAMS tandard whirls around, sees the thing clutching Hunter. It holds hi ff to one side, as though to keep Standard from getting at him tandard doesn't know what to do.
_HUNTER
"The flamethrower!"
_STANDARD
"I can't, the acid will pour out!"
At that moment the creature TAKES A BITE OUT OF HUNTER, WHO SCREAMS I ORTAL AGONY tandard can take it no longer; he raises the flamethrower and fire - BUT THE CREATURE SWINGS HUNTER AROUND AS A SHIELD AND HUNTE ATCHES THE FULL BLAST OF THE FLAME tandard instantly stops firing, but now Hunter is a kicking ball o lame, held out at arm's length by the monster NTERIOR - NOSE OF SHI oby is listening to all this on the communicator. He can hear th hrieks and crashing noises hen the communicator goes dead, and all he hears is a rush of static.
_ROBY
"Hello? Standard? Hunter?"
He waits quite a while for a response, but we can see from hi xpression that he expects none e drops his face into his hands. When he lifts his head again, he ha anaged to summon a certain amount of resolve NTERIOR - CORRIDORS IN SHI oby walks along watching the tracker, carrying a pistol in the othe and. He comes across Standard's flamethrower, lying on the floor. H icks it up, substituting it for the pistol hen he continues to follow the tracker; it takes him down the step nto the maintenance level NTERIOR - MAINTENANCE LEVE oby follows the device for a short distance until it indicates tha he source of the signal is directly under his feet. Looking down, h ees that he is standing on a square metal plate etting down on his hands and knees, he removes the heavy plate evealing a black opening with a ladder going down ubstituting the tracker for a flashlight, but still carrying th lamethrower, Roby starts down the ladder NTERIOR - DARK STORAGE ROO hining the light around into the darkness, Roby descends the meta adder to the floor HE PLACE IS A HORRIBLE LAIR, FULL OF BONES, HAIR, SHREDS OF FLESH IECES OF CLOTHING, AND SHOES omething moves in the darkness -- Roby turns his light on it ANGING FROM THE CEILING IS A HUGE COCOON. It appears to be woven fro ome fine, white, silk-like material, and it is slowly undulating lamethrower ready, Roby approaches the cocoon. As he gets clos nough, he sees that the cocoon is semi-transparent and THE BODY O TANDARD IS INSIDE IT nexpectedly, Standard's eyes open, and focus on Roby -- who jump iolently.
_STANDARD
(a feeble whisper)
"Kill me... "
_ROBY
(sickened)
"What did it do to you?"
_STANDARD
(moves his head slightly)
"Look... "
Roby turns his light where Standard indicates. Another cocoon dangle rom the ceiling, but this one looks a little different. It is smalle nd darker, with a harder shell. In fact, it looks almost EXACTLY LIK HE SPORES IN THE TOMB.
_STANDARD (CONT'D)
(whispering)
"That was Melkonis... it ate Hunter... "
_ROBY
(looking around for a tool)
"I'll get you out of there."
_STANDARD
"No... don't... "
_ROBY
"But I can save you -- get you to the Autodoc!"
_STANDARD
"No good... it's eaten too much of me... "
_ROBY
(in horror)
"What can I do?"
_STANDARD
"Kill me... "
Roby stares at him in horror, then bends down and takes a closer loo t him. REACTING, he straightens back up, raises the flamethrower, an prays a molten blast. When the entire room is in flames, he turns an crambles back up the ladder NTERIOR - MAINTENANCE LEVE oby drops to his knees and gasps for breath, trying not to throw up t length, he regains control of himself XTERIOR - OUTER SPACE - AT LIGHT SPEE he SNARK appears to hang motionless, with planets and star cluster olling past in the infinite distance NTERIOR - BRIDG oby is putting the cat into a metal, vacuum-sealed catbox, with  ittle oxygen tank on it.
_ROBY
"Kitty go bye-bye."
He seals the catbox, then turns on the oxygen. There is a faint his f pressurized air. Wild-eyed, the cat peers out of a little window i ront. It YOWLS e picks up the pressurized catbox and leaves the bridge NTERIOR - MINING & CARGO BA arrying the catbox and a shoulder bag (and of course th lamethrower), Roby goes quickly to the nearest rank of meta annisters.
_ROBY
(reading from labels)
"What'll it be, Kitty? Here -- how about some Tacitum-35, ten kilos of it. This'll buy us an island on some nice planet."
Putting the invaluable cannister into the shoulder bag, he hurrie ack up the steps NTERIOR - ENGINE ROO atbox in one hand, flamethrower in the other, Roby enters the engin oom, containing the massive stardrive engines e puts down his parcels and approaches the main control board for th ngines. Studying the instructions, he begins to close switches, on y one  SIREN BEGINS TO HONK THROUGHOUT THE SHIP.
_COMPUTER
"Attention! The cooling units for the stardrive engines are not functioning! Engines will overload in"
minutes, 50 seconds! Attention!
Finally Roby closes the last switch. Shaking with nervousness, h urriedly picks up catbox, bag and flamethrower and hurries out of th ngine room NTERIOR - CORRIDORS IN SHI oby hurries on, listening to the siren.
_COMPUTER
"Attention! Engines will overheat and main core will melt in"

The hatch door SLAMS SHUT, locking the thing in th ifeboat.

Indecisive, Roby stares at the lifeboat "LAUNCH" button. The thing ca e heard fumbling around in the passageway inally, he turns and bolts back toward the engine room NTERIOR - CORRIDORS IN SHI ike a maniac, Roby runs through the ship, level after level, poundin own stairwells, his footsteps clanging metallically throughout th hip as he sprints for the engine room.

INTERIOR - ENGINE ROO he door crashes open and Roby comes running in. The room is full o moke and the engines are whining dangerously. It is extremely hot i he room; Roby instantly breaks out in sweat e runs to controls and begins throwing back on the cooling uni witches till THE SIREN CONTINUES.

Roby pushes a button and speaks into it.
_ROBY
"Computer! I've turned all the cooling units back on! What's wrong?"
_COMPUTER
"The reaction has proceeded too far. The core has begun to melt. Engines will overload in"
minutes seconds."
A look of terror comes onto Roby's face. He turns and runs from th ngine room NTERIOR - CORRIDORS IN SHI gain, Roby must run through all the levels of the ship, this tim p the stairs, exhausted, stumbling, while the computer counts down:
_COMPUTER

INTERIOR - NOSE OF SHI eeling, gasping for breath, Roby staggers into the vestibule wher he lifeboat is berthed. He grabs the flamethrower and turns it towar he passageway t is then he realizes that THE LIFEBOAT DOOR IS OPEN AGAIN uickly, he glances around to see if the creature might be behind him hen he advances on the passageway NTERIOR - PASSAGEWA ripping with sweat, his face a mask of fear, Roby enters th assageway, flamethrower gripped tightly in his hands. He is goaded o y the siren and the computer:
_COMPUTER
"Attention! Engines will explode in 90 seconds!"
He makes it all the way to the end of the passageway, then sticks hi ead into the lifeboat NTERIOR - LIFEBOA IS POINT-OF-VIEW as he quickly scans the lifeboat, reveals that it i MPTY NTERIOR - PASSAGEWA mmediately, he turns and dashes back to the head of the passageway here he grabs the catbox and bag, then runs back into the lifeboat.

"Attention! Engines will explode in 60 seconds!"

He is no sooner in th eat than he hits the "LAUNCH" button XTERIOR - NOSE OF SHIP - OUTER SPAC he retainer clips drop away, and with a blast of ramjets, TH IFEBOAT IS LAUNCHED AWAY FROM THE "SNARK.

It squats, then pulls out its trophy -- a man's arm t begins to eat the arm, watching Roby is first thought is for the flamethrower -- unfortunately, it lies o he floor right next to the monster. Next he glances around for an lace to hide. His eye falls on a tiny locker containing a space suit ith the door standing open e begins to edge toward the locker. The creature rises. He freezes t throws down the arm. With that, Roby dives for the open locke oor, hurls himself inside, and slams the door shut NTERIOR - SPACESUIT LOCKE here is a clear glass panel in the door, and the thing puts its fac ight up to the glass, peering in at Roby.

 ... So it looks like I'll make it
"back to the Colonies on schedule after all. I should be to the frontier in another 250 years or so, and then with a little luck the network will pick me up. I'm not as rich as I was a couple days ago -- but I'm not exactly broke either. Incidentally, I did manage to salvage one souvenir out of this whole mess."
He reaches down into the carrying bag he brought on board, and pull ut the ALIEN SKULL.
_ROBY (CONT'D)
"Poor Yorick here should go at least partway toward proving I'm not a crank. I wish it was him we'd met in the first place -- things might have turned out different."
He puts the skull down on a shelf and locks a glass lid over it.
_ROBY (CONT'D)
"This is Martin Roby, executive officer, last survivor of the commercial vessel SNARK, signing off. Come on, cat, let's go to sleep."
Roby leans forward and switches off the recorder. Then he rises and arrying the cat, walks to the hypersleep freezer, which stands open e climbs in and stretches out on his back, holding the cat agains is chest.
