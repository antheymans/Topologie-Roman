Dallas begins to fiddle with the wench mechanism.

Pause.
_LAMBERT

Dallas switches on the winch motor ith a whine, it begins to reel the line in fter a moment the line tightens with a jerk he motor slows, laboring under added weight.
_DALLAS

Lambert gives her a curt nod sh turns attention to the instrumentation.
_RIPLEY
"Somebody fill me in."

They study the monitors.

_BRETT 
"It's got something down his goddamn throat."
_ASH
"That must be how it's getting oxygen to him."
_RIPLEY
"It doesn't make sense. It paralyzes him, puts him into a coma, then keeps him alive."
_PARKER
"Let's kill it. We can't leave the damn thing on him."
_ASH
"I don't know. At the moment the Creature is keeping him alive. If we remove it we might terminate Kane..."
_DALLAS
"I don't think so. Let's take the chance and cut it off him."

Ripley checks the opening sh straightens up tarts to put the pen back in his pocket hanges his mind and stands holding it by the end.
_ASH
"I've never seen anything like that, except molecular acid..."
_BRETT

The machine begins to process Kane's body.

The X-ray reveals a spreading dark blot in the chest cavity t the center, the stain is completely opaque.

"Same way everything else happens. Orders from the Company."

"Standard procedure is do what they tell you... Besides, I only know about flying... I haul cargo for a living."

_RIPLEY
"Did you ship out with Ash before."

"First time. I went five hauls with another science man. Then two days before we left Thedus, replaced him with Ash."

"Maybe we could cut some kind of special lines to the tanks. Brett and I are pretty good practical engineers...We got us back up you know."
_RIPLEY
"All by yourselves."
_ASH
"I hate to point this out but it might be better off without oxygen. It lived that way long enough."
_RIPLEY
"There's another problem. How do we find it. There's no visual communication on B and C decks. All the screens are out."
_DALLAS
"We're going to have to flush it out."
_ASH
"Sounds great...but how."
_DALLAS
"Room by room, corridor by corridor."

One of those suggestions that nobody likes.
_LAMBERT
"And what do we do when we find it."

_RIPLEY
"Trap it somehow."
_BRETT
"If we had a really strong piece of net, we could bag it... I could put something together. A long metal rod with a battery in it. Only take a few hours."
_LAMBERT
"Why do we listen to this meathead."
Dallas turns it over.
_DALLAS
"He might be right..."
EXT. OUTER SPAC he Nostromo continues through the vortex NT. INFIRMAR allas enters sh working at a read-out section.
_DALLAS
"I want to talk."
_ASH
"I'm a little busy at the moment."
Pause.
_DALLAS
"I don't care."
Pause.
_ASH
"All right, go ahead."
_DALLAS
"Why did you let the Alien survive inside Kane."
_ASH
"I'm not sure you're getting through to me."
_DALLAS
"Mother was monitoring his body. You were monitoring Mother. You must have had some idea of what was going on."
_ASH
"What are you trying to say."
A long moment.
_DALLAS
"You want the Alien to stay alive"
 ...I figure you have a reason.

_ASH
"Name one."
_DALLAS
"Look, we both work for the same company. I just want to know what's going on."
_ASH
"I don't know what the hell you're talking about. And I don't like any of the insinuations. The Alien is a dangerous form of life...I don't want it to stay alive any more than you do."
_DALLAS
"You're sure."
_ASH
"Yeah, I'm sure. You should be too."
Dallas walks out sh watches him go tares in his direction a long while...

INT. NARCISSU allas seated in the shuttle craft taring at the myriad lights of outer space ipley climbs beside him.
_RIPLEY
"I thought I'd find you here."

Dallas continues to stare.
_DALLAS
"Are the nets finished."
Pause.
_RIPLEY
"We've got an hour...Look I need some relief."
_DALLAS
"Why did you wait until now."
Ripley leans forward.
_RIPLEY
"Let me tell you something. You keep staring out there long enough, they'll be peeling you off the wall."
Ripley begins taking off her boots.
_DALLAS
"We're the new pioneers, Ripley. We even get to have our own special disease."
_RIPLEY
"I'm tired of talking."
She rises and removes her upper garments.
_DALLAS
"You waited too long."
_RIPLEY
"Give it a try anyway."
Clothing removed is arms move around her NT. BRIDG he crew has assembled rett unfolds several yards of asbestos netting ands out five thin rods ach of them like metal broom handles.
_BRETT
"I put portable generators in each of these. They're insulated down here. Just be goddamn careful not to get your hand on the end."
He touches the tip to a metal object  blue spark leaps.
_BRETT
"It won't damage the little bastard unless its skin is a lot thinner than ours...It'll just give it a little incentive."
_LAMBERT
"Now if we could only find it."
Ash picks up a portable unit.
_ASH
"I've taken care of that...tracking device. You set it to search for a moving object...It hasn't much range but when you get within a certain distance it starts beeping."
Ripley takes the tracker from Ash's hand.
_RIPLEY
"What's it key on."
_ASH
"Micro changes in air density. Keep it pointed ahead of you."

_DALLAS 
"We'll break into two teams. Whoever finds it first catches it in the net and ejects it from the nearest air lock."
(pause)
"For starters, let's make sure the bridge is safe."
Parker turns on his unit cans it around the room.
_LAMBERT
"We seem to be okay...If this damn thing works."
_DALLAS
"Ash and myself will go with Lambert. Brett and Parker will make up the second team. Ripley, you command it."
They start doling out the equipment.

"Channels are open on all decks. We'll be in constant touch."

"Hold it. I've got something."
Parker and Brett grow tense tart looking around.
_BRETT
"Where's it coming from."
Ripley peers closely at the tracker.
_RIPLEY
"Machine's screwed up. I can't tell. Needle's spinning all over the dial."
_BRETT
"Goddamn, malfunction."
Ripley turns the tracker on its side he needles stabilize.
_RIPLEY
"No, just confused. It's coming from below us."
They all look down at their feet NT. MAINTENANCE - "C" LEVE ipley, Parker and Brett come down ladder onto an endles ily corridor hey stop at the foot of the companionway.. hey move down corridor into darkness.

They switch on lights ove around two turns.

They stop quickly, almost stumbling.

"We should have killed it...Now we might pick it up on the tracker again."
_RIPLEY

_LAMBERT 
"Now what."
_PARKER
"Blast the rotten bastard with a laser and take our chances."

_RIPLEY
"No. At its present size it's  holding enough acid to tear a hole in this ship as big as this room."
_ASH
"It wouldn't do any good. It's self-regenerating. You saw that when we operated on it."
_RIPLEY 
"The only plan that's going to work is the same one we had before. Drive it into an air lock and blow it out into space."
_PARKER
"Drive it...The son-of-a-bitch is huge."
_LAMBERT
"For once he has a point. How do we drive it."
_RIPLEY
"The science department should be able to help..."
_ASH
"According to Mother, he's a primitive form of encephlepod..."

_LAMBERT
"How come it's a he."
_ASH
"Just a phrase. As a matter of fact he's both, bisexual or hermaphrodite to be precise."

_DALLAS
"Skip its sex life. How do we kill it."
_ASH
"It seems to have adapted to an oxygen-rich atmosphere and it's certainly adapted well for its nutritional requirements. The only thing we don't know about is temperature."
_RIPLEY
"Curious isn't it...That the Alien is an encephlepod..."
_ASH
"What's so curious about that."
_RIPLEY
"It's curious because lower species can't adapt as quickly as higher ones. And this one's doing very well. A real survivor. Might even have as good a chance as we do."
_ASH
"You're getting paranoid again."
_RIPLEY
"All right. What about the temperature. What happens if we change it."
_ASH
"Let's give it a try. Most animals retreat from fire."
Pause.
_PARKER
"I can hook up a couple of incinerating units in about fifteen minutes."

_DALLAS
"This could work for us. The duct comes out at the starboard air lock. There's an exit on the way. But we can close that off. Then we drive it into the air lock and blast it into space."
_LAMBERT
"Yeah. All you have to do is crawl in the vent with it, find your way through the maze and hope it's afraid of fire."
