THE LOST WORLD
JURASSIC PARK
EXT. TROPICAL LAGOON - DA  135-foot-luxury yacht is anchored just offshore in a ropical lagoon. The beach is a stunning crescent of whit and at the jungle fringe, utterly deserted.
ISLA SORNA

miles southeast of Nublar
Two SHIP HANDS, dressed in white uniforms, have set up  icnic table with three chairs on the sand and are carefull aying out luncheon service -- fine china, silver, crysta ecanters with red and white wine AUL BOWMAN, fortyish, sits in a chair off to the side eading. MRS. BOWMAN, painfully thin, with the perpetuall urprised look of a woman who's had her eyes done more tha nce, supervises the settings of the table he looks up and sees a little girl, CATHY, seven or eigh ears old, wandering off down the beach.
_MRS. BOWMAN
"Cathy! Don't wander off!"
Cathy keeps wandering.
_MRS. BOWMAN (cont'd)
"Cathy, come back! You can look for shells right here!"
Cathy gestures, pretending she can't hear.
_BOWMAN
(eyes still in his book)
"Leave her alone."
_MRS. BOWMAN
"What about snakes?"
_BOWMAN
"There's no snakes on a beach. Let her have fun, for once."
FURTHER DOWN THE BEACH athy keeps wandering away, MUTTERING to herself as he arents' quarreling voices fade in the distance.
_CATHY
"Please be quiet, please be quiet please be quiet..."
Rounding a curve in the beach, her parents disappear from vie ehind her. A RUSTLING sound draws her attention, and sh urns, toward where the thick jungle foliage gives way to th and  large bush, maybe twelve feet tall, is moving, its branche waying and shaking. Curious, Cathy walks up to the bush hich abruptly stops moving  small, lizard-like animal, dark green with brown stripe long its back, steps out from the bush. Only about a foo all, it stands on its hind legs, balancing on its thick tail t walks upright, bobbing its head like a chicken.
_CATHY
"Well, hello there!"
The animal (a COMPSOGNATHUS) just stares at her. Cathy squat own on her haunches.
_CATHY (cont'd)
"What are you? A little bird or something?"
She opens her hand. She's got a handful of goldfish crackers.
_CATHY (cont'd)
"Are you hungry? You want a goldfish?"
The compy bobs forward a few steps, cautiously.
_CATHY (cont'd)
"Come on. I won't hurt you."
The compy draws closer. Cathy holds the cracker in the pal f her hand. The compy gets closer still - - and hops numbly up onto Cathy's palm. Her arm dips a bi nder the weight, but it's not that heavy, and she holds it u asily. It bobs its head, scarfs up the goldfish, and eat t nchanted, Cathy breaks into an enormous grin and returns he and, calling back over her shoulder.
_CATHY (cont'd)
"Mom! Dad! You gotta come see this! I found something!"
She turns back hirty more compys have come out onto the sand. They'r tanding there, bobbing anxiously, staring at her from a fe eet away. Cathy's smile fades he turns her head slowly to the right. TWENTY MORE COMPY ave come in from that side, forming a semi-circle, bobbin nd CHIPPING as they surround her.
_CATHY (cont'd)
(terrified)
"What do you guys want?"
BACK ON THE BEACH he table is set. Mrs. Bowman calls out.
_MRS. BOWMAN
"Cathy, sweetheart! Lunch is ready!"
From around the curve of the beach, a flock of birds bolt rom the jungle trees as Cathy's shrill SCREAMS suddenl ierce the air.
_MRS. BOWMAN
"PAUL!"
She takes off, running down the beach, Mr. Bowman leaps out o is chair and follows, and all available deck hands race of o help, kicking up geysers of sand behind them OWN THE BEACH rs. Bowman stops dead in her tracks when she rounds the ben n the beach. We don't see what she sees, but we hear th renzied SQUEAKING of the strange compys. Mr. Bowman and th ands race past her to help Cathy as Mrs. Bowman lets loose  orrified, slack-jawed SCREAM, her mouth a perfect oval.
_DISSOLVE TO:
INT. BOARD ROOM - DA rs. Bowman's screaming face dissolves slowly over th AWNING face of a bored CORPORATE EXECUTIVE, TWENTY OTHE XECUTIVES sit around a conference table in the boardroom of  onied corporation. All are in expensive suits, most are ove ixty. There are rows of BACKBENCHERS too, whispering in thei awyers who sit behind their clients, whispering in thei ars. Empty coffee cups and fast food containers on the tabl int that everyone's been here a long time  familiar VOICE resounds through the boardroom as we mov own the long table, pat the grim faces of the board members.
_VOICE (O.S.)
"The hurricane seemed like a disaster at the time, but now I think it was a blessing, nature's way of freeing those animals from their human confines. Of giving them another chance to survive, but this time as they were meant to, without man's interference."
The source of the voice is JOHN HAMMOND, the founder of InGe nd creator of Jurassic Park. But he's not in the room. Hi mage is on a closed circuit TV screen, which has been wheele p to the end of the table nd he doesn't look good. He's terribly infirmed, propped u n bed, his face pale and drawn, medical equipment BEEPIN round him.
_HAMMOND (cont'd)
"There are some corporate issues that are not about the bottom line. We have so much still to learn about those creatures. A whole world of intricate, interlocking behaviors, vanished everywhere -- except for Site B. Please. Let's not do what is good for more men at the expense at what is best for all mankind."
The CHAIRMAN, seventyish, nods awkwardly to the television.
_CHAIRMAN
"Thank you, John. Mr. Ludlow?"
He turns to PETER LUDLOW, late thirties, a man with th nxious look of someone who insists the buck stop on his desk udlow flips open a file, pulls out a stack of black and whit ight by tens, and tosses them on the table.
_LUDLOW
(an accent similar to
_Hammond's)
"These pictures were taken in a hospital in Costa Rica forty-eight hours ago, after an American family on a yacht cruise stumbled onto Site B. The little girl will be fine, but her parents are wealthy, angry, and very fond of lawsuits. But that's hardly new to us, is it?"
(takes a paper from the
 file)
"Wrongful death settlements, partial list: family of Donald Gennaro, 36.5 million dollars; family of Robert Muldoon, 12.6 million. Damaged or destroyed equipment, 17.3 million. Demolition, de-construction, and disposal of Isla Nublar facilities, organic and inorganic, one hundred and twenty-six million dollars. The list goes on, gentlemen -- research funding, media payoffs. Silence is expensive."
He's warming up. Not a bad performer.
_LUDLOW (cont'd)
"This corporation has been bleeding from the throat for four years. You, our board of directors, have set patiently and listened to ecology lectures while Mr. Hammond signed your checks and spent your money. You have watched your stock drop from seventy-eight and a quarter to nineteen flat with no good and in sight. And all along, we have held a significant product asset that we could have safely harvested and displayed for profit. Enormous profit."
He reaches out to a model on the table and gives it a shove ending it sliding down the length of the table in front o hem. It's a mini-mall version of a zoo. Cages hold tin eplicas of various kinds of dinosaurs while Boy Scout troop nd Tourists look on in wonder.
_LUDLOW (cont'd)
"Enough money to wipe out four years of lawsuits and damage control and unpleasant infighting, enough to not only send our stock back to where it was but to double it. And the one thing, the only thing standing between us and this asset is a born-again naturalist who happens to be our own CEO. Well, I don't work for Mother Nature. I work for you."
Two of his Backbenchers distribute documents from a stack udlow takes one and reads from it.
_LUDLOW (cont'd)
 "Whereas the Chief Executive
"Officer has engaged in wasteful and negligent business practices to further his own personal environmental beliefs -- Whereas these practices have  affected the financial performance of the company by incurring significant losses -- Whereas the shareholders have been materially harmed by these losses -- Thereby, be it resolved that John Parker Hammond should be resolved from the office of Chief Executive Officer, affective immediately." Mr. Chairman, I move the resolution be put to an immediate vote. Do I have a second?"
_BOARD MEMBER
"I second the motion, Mr. Chairman, Please poll the members by a show of hands."
The CHAIRMAN signs heavily, feeling like a traitor. He can' ear to look at Hammond on the TV monitor.
_CHAIRMAN
"All those in favor of InGen Corporate Resolution 213C, please signify your approval by raising your right hand."
It starts slowly, guiltily, but every hand in the room goe p. Ludlow sits back, victorious. Hammond, furious, raise is right hand, which holds a remote control, and points it a he TV screen. It goes blank.

Scrap iron and steel lies everywhere omewhere inside the shed, a phone RINGS he WHOOSH of the arc welder shuts off. DIETER STARK, a bi arrel-chested man of forty or so, his face streaked with soo nd grime, steps outside with a cordless phone, a cigarett angling from his lips.

SUBWAY CAR - NIGH ALCOLM finds a seat on the crowded subway car and sits down e looks awful. Tired. Weathered. He notices a CURIOUS MA cross from his is staring at his. Malcolm looks away. Th urious Man still stares. Nervy, the Curious Man gets up an pproaches.
_MALCOLM
(under his breath)
"Shit."
The Curious Man sits down next to Malcolm, grinning.
_MAN
"You're him, aren't you?"
_MALCOLM
"Excuse me?"
_MAN
"The guy. The scientist. I saw you on TV."
(conspiratorially)
"I believed you."
No response from Malcolm. The guy leans in even closer.
_MAN (cont'd)
"Roooooarr."
_MALCOLM
(a withering look)
"I was misquoted. I was merely speculating on the evolutionary scenario of a Lost World. I never said I was in any such place."
He gets up and moves to another seat on the car, away from th urious Man. As he sits down, he notices two other COMMUTER cross from him are staring at him e looks at them. They looks away e pulls the collar of his coat up tight around him. Nowher o hide NT. JOHN HAMMOND'S APARTMENT - NIGH  UNIFORMED BUTLER has a question:
_BUTLER
"Whom shall I tell Mr. Hammond is calling?"
MALCOLM stands in the foyer of an expensively decorated Par venue apartment.
_MALCOLM
"Ian Malcolm"
A door opens and a little dog comes YAPPING out of the back t bounds straight at Malcolm, GROWLING, jaws SNAPPING. I unges - - and Malcolm BATS it away with one swift swing of his cane he dog rolls across the floor and slinks away, WHINING. Th utler looks at Malcolm disapprovingly.

_BUTLER
"Not an animal lover?"
_MALCOLM
"Not really."
INT. HAMMOND'S BEDROOM - NIGH ALCOLM enters a darkened bedroom. JOHN HAMMOND lies in th ed we saw earlier, on the other side of the room edical equipment has been disguised as well as possible amon he furniture and flowers, but the sheer abundance of it tell s that whatever has stricken him is going to win this battle.
_HAMMOND
"Ian! Don't linger in the doorway like an ingenue, come in, come in!"
Malcolm steps further into the room.
_HAMMOND (cont'd)
"It's good to see you. It really is. How's the leg?"
_MALCOLM
"Resentful."
_HAMMOND
"When you have a lot of time to think, it's funny who you remember. It's the people who challenged you. It is the quality of our opponents that gives our accomplishments meaning. I never told you how sorry I was about what happened after we returned."

Noticing Hammond's deteriorated condition, Malcolm finds i ard to sustain anger.

_MALCOLM
"I didn't know you -- weren't well."
 
_HAMMOND
"It's the lawyers. The lawyers are finally killing me."
 
_MALCOLM
"They do have motives. Why did you want to see me? Your message said it was urgent."
 
_HAMMOND
"You were right -- and I was wrong. There! Did you ever think you'd hear me say that? Spectacularly wrong. Instead of observing those animals, I tried to control them. I squandered an opportunity and we still know next to nothing about their lives. Not their lives as man would have them, behind electric fences, but in the wild. Behavior in their natural habitat, the impossible dream of any paleontologist. I could have had it, but I let it slip away."
(pause)
"Thank God for Site B."
 
Malcolm just looks at him for a long moment.

_MALCOLM
"What?"
 
_HAMMOND
(a spark in his eye)
"Well? Didn't it all seem a trifle compact to you?"
 
_MALCOLM
"What are you talking about?"

_HAMMOND
"The hatchery, in particular? You know my initial yields had to be low, far less than one percent, that's a thousand embryos for every single live birth. Genetic engineering on that scale implies a giant operation, not the spotless little laboratory I showed you."
_MALCOLM
"I don't believe you."
_HAMMOND
"Isla Nublar was just a showroom, Ian, something for the tourists, Site B was the factory floor. We built it first, on Isla Sorna, eight-some miles from Nublar."
_MALCOLM
"No, no, no, no, no, no . . ."
_HAMMOND
"After the accident at the park, a hurricane wiped out our facility on Site B. We had to evacuate and leave the animals to fend for themselves. And they did. For four years I've fought to keep them safe from human meddling, now I want you to go there and document them."
_MALCOLM
"Are you out of your mind? I still have nightmares, my reputation's a joke, my leg is shot -- you think I need more of that?"
_HAMMOND
"It would be the most extraordinary living fossil record the world has ever seen."
_MALCOLM
"So what?"
Hammonnd picks up a thick file folder from the night table nea o him and open it on his lap. Inside, there are memos harts, maps and photographs.
_HAMMOND
"I've been putting this together for over a year."
(MORE)
"I have personal suggestions for your entire team, phone numbers, contact people. They won't believe you about what they're going to see, so don't bother trying to convince them. Just use my checkbook to get them there. I'll fund your expedition through my personal accounts, as such money and equipment as you need, but only if you leave immediately. If we hesitate, all will be lost."
_MALCOLM
"John . . ."
_HAMMOND
"You'll need an animal behaviorist, someone with unimpeachable credentials. I believe you already know Sarah Harding. She's got theories about parenting and nurturing among hunter/scavengers I bet she'd be dying to prove on a scale like this. If you convince her to go, it'll be a major coup. When she publishes, the scientific community must take it seriously."
Malcolm just shakes his head, flipping through the file sadly.
_HAMMOND
"Your documentation, you should use forensic photographic methods, Hasselbladt still cameras, high definition video. When the trick photography analysts take your evidence apart, make it impossible for them to say there was enhancement or computer graphic imaging. Oh, this is very important -- avoid the island interior at all costs. Stick to the outer rim. Everything you need to know can be found there. Vindication lies on the outer rim."
Malcolm gently closes the file and pushes it back to Hammond.
_MALCOLM
"I'm not going, John."
_HAMMOND
(fatigue returning)
"Ian, you are my last chance to give something of real value to the world. I can't walk so far and leave no footprints; die and leave nothing with my name on it. I will not be known only for my failures. And you will not allow yourself to go down in history as a lunatic. You're too smart. You'e too proud. Dr. Malcolm. Please. This is a chance at redemption. For both of us. There's no time to equivocate, we must seize it now, before --"
He stops, staring over Malcom's shoulder. Malcom turns ETER LUDLOW, still in his overcoat, is standing in th oorway to the bedroom. He looks back and forth from Hammon o Malcolm suspiciously.
_LUDLOW
"Hello, Uncle John. Dr. Malcolm."
Malcolm doesn't answer. He seems to know Ludlow, and dislike im.
_LUDLOW (cont'd)
"Did I interrupt something?"
Malcolm turns back to Hammond.
_MALCOLM
"Find someone else."
_CUT TO:
INT. HAMMOND'S APARTMENT/FOYER - NIGH n the foyer, LUDLOW hands MALCOLM his coat, just a trifl udely, and shepherds him to the door.
_LUDLOW
"So, you two were just, uh, telling old campfire stories, were you?"
_MALCOLM
"Do me a favor. Don't pretend for a second that you and I don't know the truth. You can convince Time magazine and the Skeptical Inquirer of whatever you want, but I was  there."
_LUDLOW
"You signed a non-disclosure agreement before you went to the island that expressly forbade you from discussing anything you saw. You violated that agreement."
_MALCOLM
"You cost me my livelihood. That on which I relied to support my children."
_LUDLOW
"If your university felt you were causing it embarrassment by selling wild stories to Hard Copy, I hardly see how I am to--"
_MALCOLM
"I didn't tell anything, I told the truth."
_LUDLOW
"You version of it."
_MALCOLM
"There are no versions of the truth! This isn't a corporate maneuver, it's my life."
_LUDLOW
"We made a generous compensatory offer for your injuries."
_MALCOLM
"It was a payoff and an insult. InGen never--"
_LUDLOW
"InGen is my livelihood, Dr. Malcolm, and I will jealously defend its interests. People will know what I want them to know when I want them to know it."
Ludlow tosses something to Malcolm, hard. It sails across th oyer, upright, and Malcolm reaches out and catches it wit ne hand. It's his cane.
_LUDLOW (cont'd)
"Don't forget that."
Malcolm stares at him for a long moment. Finally, he turn nd walks away ut he does not out of the apartment. Instead, h alks directly past Ludlow, crosses the living room, and step ack into Hammond's bedroom, closing the door behind him wit  determined CLICK NT.

"You. Tell me, Roland, when was the last time you answered your phone?"
_ROLAND
"Last time I plugged it in, I suppose. Why?"
Behind them, the group of TOURISTS, all men, laughs loudly ne of them, the MOST OBNOXIOUS TOURISTS, berates the WAITRESS.
_AJAY
"I got a call from a gentleman who's going to Costa Rica, or thereabouts. If he's to be believed, it's a most, uh, unique expedition. And very well-funded."
_ROLAND
"Well, I'm a very well-funded old son of a bitch. You go."
The Most Obnoxious Tourist bellows for the Waitress. Hi uddies LAUGHS. Roland throws a glance, annoyed.
_AJAY
"But alone? We always had great success together, you and I."
_ROLAND
"Just a little bit too much, I think."
_AJAY
"How do you mean?"
_ROLAND
"A true hunter doesn't mind if the animal wins. If it escapes. But there weren't enough escapes from you and me, Ajay. I've decided to spend a bit less time in the company of death. Maybe I just feel too close to it my--"
The Waitress comes to the Tourists' table and the Mos bnoxious Tourist actually paws her ass. Roland is out of hi hair in a second.
_ROLAND (cont'd)

"Excuse me."
Romand walks over to the Tourists' table, says something t he Waitress in the local dialect, and she walks away, behin im. He stares down at the Most Obnoxious Tourist.

"You, sir -- are no gentleman."

"Is that supposed to be an insult?"
_ROLAND
"I can think of none greater."
The Tourist looks at his Buddies and laughs.
_TOURIST
"Buzz off, you silly old bastard."
_ROLAND
"What do I have to do to pick a fight with you, bring your mother into it?"
_TOURIST
"Are you kidding? I could take you with one arm tied down."
_ROLAND
"Really?"
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FLOOR he Waiter finishes tying a man's wrist to his belt in th ack of his pants with a napkin. He pulls the knot tight an he man turns around t's Roland, with his arm tied down. The Tourist stand cross from him.
_TOURIST
"I mean my arm."
POW! Roland punches him square in the jaw. The Touris eels, stunned. Enraged, he lunges at Roland, swinging wit oth arms oland bobs, neatly ducking the punches, waits for the Touris o turn around, and POPS him thrice in the face. The Touris pins and goes down to the floor, face first. A cloud o awdust and a loud CHEER from the locals rise up in the bar ACK AT HIS TABLE oland drops the napkin on the table and sits back down wit jay. In the background, the Tourist's Buddies hurriedl arry their fallen cohort out of the bar.

"You broke that idiot's jaw for no reason other than your boredom. Tell the truth, Roland. Aren't you even interested in knowing this expedition's quarry?"

_MALCOLM
"Very hurtful. Your mother tell you to say that?"
_KELLY
"No, Dad. I have thoughts of my own once in a while."
From the construction floor, EDDIE calls out.
_EDDIE (o.s.)
"Dr. Malcolm!"
Malcolm looks at her, trying to make peace. Quickly.
_MALCOLM
"Is that kid still bothering you?"
_KELLY
"Which one?"
_MALCOLM
"You know, at the bus stop. With the hair?"
_KELLY
"That was about a year ago."
_MALCOLM
"Well, is he?"
_KELLY
"No. Richard talked to his parents."
_MALCOLM
"That Richard."
_EDDIE (o.s.)
"Ian, come here a minute!"
_KELLY
(to Malcolm)
"I could come with you."
_MALCOLM
"Out of the question. You'd miss the gymnastics trials. You've been training for that for a year."
_KELLY
"I don't care about the trials, I want to be with you. I could be your research assistant, like I was in Austin."
_MALCOLM
"This is nothing like Austin. Forget about it."
_KELLY
"You like to have kids, you just don't want to be with them, do you?"
He looks at her, hurt. Eddie calls out a third time mpatient now. Grateful for the escape, Malcolm gets up an eads for the door. He pauses guiltily.
_MALCOLM
"I'm not like you wan me to be. I've what I can be."
He leaves NT. MAIN FLOOR - DA hile MALCOLM and EDDIE argue over something in th ackground, KELLY circles around the trailers and looks up a he windows. They're all made of tempered glass, fine wir esh inside it. She looks around, to see if anybody' atching. They're not, so she quickly slips inside the fron railer NT. TRAILER - DA nside, the trailer is a miracle of planning and design. It' ivided into sections, for different laboratory functions he main area is a biological lab, with specimen trays issecting pans, and microscopes that connect to vide onitors ext to it there's an extensive computer section, a bank o rocessors, and a communications section. All the la quipment is miniaturized and built into small tables tha lides into the walls. Everything is bolted down he notices a large map on the wall. Off the coat of Cost ica, there is an area that has been circled in heavy blac nk elly puts a finger on the map, crossing westward, through th acific Ocean. Thegre are dozen s of islands out here, but i he highlighted region, there is a semi-circle of five atanceros. Muerte. Tacano. Pena. And Sorna. Underneat he whole island chain, there is a bold legend.
"The Five Deaths," it says.
Slowly, an ocean barge starts to chug its way across th ace of the map, leaving a wake that rolls the printed letter f those three ominous words.
_DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. OPEN SEA - DA he map dissolves slowly away as the barge SPALASEHS throug ive foot ocean swells in the open sea. The barge is cramme ith equipment, the AAV, trailers, a jeep, and the members o alcolm's team N THE BOAT ALCOLM stands in the bow, riding the choppy seas. Next t im, DR. JUTTSON, fortyish, holds onto the railing easick. He SHOUTS over the DRONE of the boat's engines.
_JUTTISON
(as the waves pound the
 boat)
"Couldn't -- we just -- airlift -- into the -- island?"
_MALCOLM
"Dr. Harding insisted we go by sea! Helicopters are too disruptive. These aren't piles of bones you'll be studying this time, Dr. Juttson, they live, they breathe, and they react!"
Juttson looks at him skeptically - - and throws up T THE BACK OF THE BOAT ICK VAN OWEN, a good-looking American in his lat wenties, is sitting amid a pile of video cameras and othe hotographic equipment, playing with a Game Bow. SARA ARDING, dressed in field gear, sits down next to him.
_SARAH
"So what's your story, Nick?"
_NICK
"I was a cameraman for Nightline for six years, been freelance since '91. Do a lot of work for Greenpeace."
_SARAH
"That must be interesting. What drew you there?"
_NICK
"Women. 'Bout eighty percent female in Greenpeace."
_SARAH
"Very noble of you."
(of the noisy Game Boy)
"You don't think you're bringing that thing onto the island, do you?"
Nick grins and shuts it off.
_NICK
"Hey, I wouldn't want to spook the woolly mammoths."
_SARAH
"You think this is all a joke?"
_NICK
"Oh, please. How am I supposed to keep a straight face when --"
(gestures to the
 black-clad Malcolm)
"-- Johnny Cash here tells me I'm going to Skull Island?"
_SARAH
(not amused)
"Ian's a very good friend of mine."
_NICK
"He doesn't need a friend, he needs a shrink."
_SARAH
"I believe in him."
But her face says even she has her doubts.
_NICK
"Come on, there's only one reason any of us are here. His check cleared."
She looks at him.
_SARAH
"Drop the cynical pose. You can't pull it off while playing Donkey Kong."
The boat's CAPTAIN, a Costa Rican, points ahead and SHOUTS t hem.
_CAPTAIN
"There it is!"
They all turn and look out over the bow. Up ahead, shear eddish-gray cliffs of volcanic rock rise dramatically out o he fog-heavy ocean.
_CAPTAIN (cont'd)
"Isla Sorna!"
The boat ROARS ahead, plowing into a heavy wreath of fog. Th ist swirls and encircles it XT. ISLAND FIORD - DA  narrow inlet cuts through the steep cliffs, leading to th sland interior. The barge bursts through the fog at th outh of the fiord and heads deeper into the island XT. LAGOON - DA ush green plants drip everywhere in this verdant lagoon ulfurous yellow steam issues from the ground, bleaching th earby foliage white. In the distance one can hear the crie f JUNGLE BIRDS he boat is now beached and the CREW flips the tarps off th AV, the jeep, and the trailers. The trucks back down  arrow ramp and onto the soft clay shore at the edge of th agoon. There is a large three-toad animal imprint in th lay at the water's edge, and the AAV backs right over it wapping its track for the animal's ALCOLM is at the edge of the water with the CAPTAIN.
_MALCOLM
"Be back in three days, but keep the satellite phone on and your radio tuned to the frequency I specified in case we need you sooner."
_CAPTAIN
"Don't worry. I've lived around here all my life, these islands are completely --"
In the distance, they hear the faint, strange ROAR of a ver arge animal. The Captain looks at Malcolm, eyes wide.
_CAPTAIN (cont'd)
"-- safe."
_CUT TO:
EXT. GRASSY PLAIN - DA he jeep tows the double trailer to the edge of a grassy plai ust beyond the lagoon, overlooking the interior of th sland. The noon sun is high overhead; below, the valle himmers in midday heat DDIE connects a flexible cable to the jeep's power winch an licks it on. The cable turns slowly in the sunlight. Movin long the length of it, we see the cable leads to a pile o luminum, some kind of strut assembly painted a camouflag olor s the winch pulls the cable tight, the jumble of thin strut egins to move, slowly rising into the air. The emergin tructure climbs, spidery, struts unfolding, fifteen feet int he air. The light house at the top (the cage that wa ested back at Eddie's workshop) is now just beneath th owest branches of the nearby trees, which almost conceal i rom view ICK lights a cigarette and carelessly tosses the match on th round. Malcolm notices.
_MALCOLM
"Listen. I know you all have probably concluded that I'm out of my mind."
Is it our imagination, or did the trees behind Malcolm jus way slightly?
_MALCOLM (cont'd)
"That's all right, for now. But just humor me and be careful."
No, it's not our imagination, there they go again. Whol rees shivering and swaying from left to right and bac gain.
_MALCOLM (cont'd)
"Even if you think I'm harmless and deluded, I promise --"
Now the trees CREAKS and GROAN as they sway. Everyone has see t, and now Malcolm turns around too.
_MALCOLM (cont'd)
"-- this place is for real."
_CUT TO:
INT. DOUBLE TRAILERS - DA t's quiet inside the trailers that serve as their comman ost/living quarters. The books are lined up neatly on th helves. The computers sit, booted up and awaiting dat nput ll the way in the back, past the spare tires and lif reservers and canned food and bottled water, up in on torage bin all the way on top, there's a RUSTLING SOUND  plastic student ID card pops out in the cracks under th in's door. A photograph in the lower right hand corner o he card is visible -- it's Kelly, Malcolm's twelve-year-ol aughter he card wriggles against the lock and, with a soft CLICK, th oor pops open. KELLY herself tumbles out, wrapped in severa lankets and carrying a mason jar half full of a yellowis iquid. We can guess he leaps to her feet, blinks the light out of her eyes, an olts to the back of the trailer as fast as she possibly can he races through a narrow door and SLAMS it shut  sign on the door says "RESTROOM." Inside, a SIGH of relie s heard.
_CUT TO:
EXT. JUNGLE TRAIL - DA long a stream bed, the jungle trees still shiver. NICK load  three quarter inch tape into his heavy video camera an hews anxiously on a piece of gum. SARAH and DR. JUTTSON ar eside him as the group nervously follows the GROANING fores rees to their right t the rear, EDDIE and MALCOLM walk side by side. Eddie i arrying a heavy silver rifle, an aluminum canister hangin eneath the barrel. He shows it to Malcolm, his voice low an rgent.
_EDDIE
"Lindstradt air rifle. Fires a subsonic Fluger impact-delivery dart."
He cracks open the cartridge bank, revealing a row of plasti ontainers filled with straw-colored liquid. Each is tippe ith a three inch needle and carries a bright yellow warnin ag -- "EXTREME DANGER! LETHAL TOXICITY!"
_EDDIE (cont'd)
"I loaded the enhanced venom of Conus purpurascens, the South Sea cone shell. Most powerful neurotoxin in the world. Acts within a two-thousandth of a second. Faster than the nerve-conduction velocity. The animal's down before it feels the prick of the dart."
From their right, the shaking trees seen closer now. B alking down the stream bed, the humans are tracking righ long with the animals as they move in the foliage.
_MALCOLM
(to Eddie)
"Is there an antidote?"
_EDDIE
"Like if you shoot yourself in the foot? Wouldn't matter. You'd be dead before you realized you'd accidentally pulled the trigger."
Ahead of them, thick foliage blocks the path of the dried u tream bed to the height of about fifteen feet. But aroun hem, the CRASHING sounds get louder and closer, the swayin rees shiver right beside them. Eddie raises the rifle i efense as the trees right at the edge of the stream bed swa nd part. Above the foliage, they see the sudde ovement - - of a row of STEGOSAUR fins. The spade-shaped fins ru long a ridge down the middle of the animal's back, abou hree feet tall each. The group freezes, amazed, and as th tegosaur continues on, they get a good look at it through  reak in the foliage t's a large dinosaur with a small head, a thick neck, and  uge lumbering body  double row of plates runs along the crest of its back, an t has a dragging trail with long spikes in it he gum drops out of Nick's mouth, FLOPS onto his shirt, an ticks there.
_NICK
"Oh --"
_JUTTSON
"-- my --"
_EDDIE
"-- God!"
_SARAH
"It's beautiful!"
A second stegosaur, a baby about a quarter the size of th irst animal, breaks through the foliage, following the adult hile the group is reaching to that, the earth vibrates an  third stego, by far the biggest of the three, walks out o he foliage right behind them, crossing within ten feet pparently unconcerned about these little creatures in thei nvironment, the stegos continue on across the stream bed arah raises a still camera and shoots pictures. Her shutte s muted, so that a muffled CLICK is all that's audible uttson raises a pocket recorder to his lips and whispers int t breathlessly.
_JUTTSON
"Stegosaurus, family Stegosauridae, infraorder Stegosauria, suborder Thyreophora. Length, adult male, estimate twenty-five to thirty feet."
His breathy words turn into almost helpless laughter, of al hings, as he can't contain his astonishment. Eddie cover is mouth, trying to keep him quiet.
_SARAH
(to Juttsn)
"That was a pair bond! A family group, even, long after that infant was nestbound!"
_JUTTSON
"I want to see the nesting ground!"
Nick turns to Malcolm, eyes like saucers, and makes a futile ordless, boy-was-I-wrong-on-this-one gesture. Malcol miles, leans over, and TAPS softly on Nick's video camera ick raises it to his shoulder and flicks it on as the grou ontinues on into the bush after the animals N THE BUSH he baby wanders away from the group and ambles over nea here Sarah crouches in the bushes. Sarah raises her camer gain and silently SNAPS a picture. She WHISPERS to Juttson ho is beside her.
_SARAH
"Lone nest -- not colonial. I don't see an egg clutch..."
She gestures and Juttson peers through a pair of fiel lasses.
_JUTTSON
(whispering back)
"The empty shells are crushed and trampled. The young stay in the birth environment, that's conclusive!"
_SARAH
"Not without a shot of the nest."
She sees an opportunity. As the baby heads back to it arents, Sarah scoots right along with it, moving behind it sing its body as a shield to block her from the view of th ther two ick and Eddie's faces whiten in alarm. Nick reaches out t top her, but he barely gets hold of the sole of her boo efore she pulls away from him and duckwalks out into th learing N THE CLEARING arah slinks along behind the baby stego as it walks back oward the nest, chewing the branches it carries in its south he raises up sightly, squeezing off pictures of the herd ver better as she gets closer ACK AT THE HILL he others can only watch her, aghast.
_NICK
"She's gutty."
_MALCOLM
"She's nuts."
IN THE CLEARING arah keeps moving closer. The baby passes a small groupin f rocks and Sarah ducks behind them. She's now in a perfec osition to photograph the nest, and she squeezes off pictur fter picture from this ideal vantage point he shoots the last picture on the roll - - and the camera's autowinder WHIRS to life. Sarah look own in horror as the camera's motor WHINES loudly in he ands h noise startles the animals. The male turns toward he he plates on its back bristling. Sarah gets to her feet an tarts to move away, slowly he male turns away from her and swings its tail, spike xtended. It WHIZZES through the air, right at her, but Sara eaps back at the last second - - and the tail's spikes THUD into the dirt where she was arah CRUNCHES to the ground and the three stegosaurs dar way, disappearing into the bush, moving surprisingly quickl or animals their size he others run to Sarah, help her to her feet, and pull he ack, against a massive tree trunk. But the tree trunk lift ight up off the ground t's no tree, it's a DINOSAUR'S LEG, a massive one, six fee cross, God knows how many feet high. The Group gasps an ooks up as a MAKENCHIASAURUS, an enormous saurupod over  undred feet from nose to tail, lumbers away from them he Group stares in wonder as the mamenchiasaur stops an ONKS furtively, its long neck stretched out above them ow a second mamenchiasaur neck cranes out of th urrounding forest trees and wraps around the first. Th irst mamenchiasaur THUNDERS around in a semi-circle, gettin nto position behind the second ick swings his video camera straight up and the grou uddenly finds itself in the middle of a mamenchiasaur mating he mighty tails swing and SNAP around them as the two animal ome together, and trees start snapping and falling, CRASHIN o the jungle floor he group panics and bolts for cover toward the only plac here the trees are not falling -- which is directly underneat he animals mid HONKS and BLEATS, the swinging tails continue to defores he jungle around them he noise and chaos is deafening, drowning out the LAUGHTE nd SCREAMS of the fascinated and terrified group here is a momentary lull and the group dashes out fro nderneath the animals, disappearing into the thick forest  SHORT DISTANCE AWAY he Group collapses to the ground, breathless, chests heavin ith wild, frightened laughter. Sarah goes to Malcolm an hrows her arms around him, exhilarated.
_SARAH
"Ian, you're not insane! I'm so glad!"
_JUTTSON
(out of breath)
"Dr. Malcolm -- the world -- owes you an apology."
_CUT TO:
EXT. JUNGLE TRAIL - DA uddenly, the Gathereres are taking their expedition a lot mor eriously. They march quickly back to base camp, their energ nd excitement palpable. NICK strikes a match and raises i o a cigarette with a shaking hand, but SARAH leans in an lows it out.
_SARAH
"No more smoking. We leave no scent of any kind. No hair tonics, no cologne, seal all our food in plastic bags. We will observe and document, but we will not interact."
_MALCOLM
"That's a scientific impossibility, you know. Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Whatever you study, you also change."
Nick ejects the used videotape from his camera and pulls out  harpie, to label it.
_NICK
"What should I call this? "Jurassic Pork?""
Eddie, next to him, laughs.
_SARAH
(still to Malcolm)
"And let's forget about the high hide. We can't do this kind of work up in a tower, we need to be out in the field, as close to the animals as possible."
_JUTTSON
"I'm not surprised stegosaur lived in a family group, but there's never been anything in the fossil record to prove the carnivores did."
_SARAH
"Why wouldn't they? Look at hyenas, jackals, nearly all species of predator birds --"
_JUTTSON
"That doesn't say a thing about T-rex, they could have been rogues. Robert Burke certainly thinks they were."
_SARAH
"We've got to see one to find out. Is there any --"
_MALCOLM
"No way."
_NICK
"Oh, my God."
_SARAH
"-- way we could safely --"
_NICK
"Oh, no!"
He takes off, running as fast as he can, down the trail oward base camp. They look ahead, in the direction Nick i unning. A plume of black smoke is rising up over the trees.
_EDDIE
"Fire!"
_CUT TO:
EXT. BASE CAMP - DA ICK bursts out of the trees and races toward the thick plum f smoke. In the middle of the base camp, someone has neatl uilt a campfire surrounded by stones. Flames burn in th iddle ick races over to it and stomps it out as the OTHERS emerg rom the trees behind him.
_MALCOLM
"A campfire?!"
Nick grabs a jug of water, but Sarah steps in.
_SARAH
"No! Water mixes the smoke billow, use dirt!"
They start to kick and rake dirt onto the fire with thei ands and feet. Eddie and Dr. Juttson jump in and help out.
_MALCOLM
"Who the hell started a campfire?!"
_VOICE (o.s.)
"It was just to make lunch."
Malcolm turns toward the source of the voice. KELLY stands i he doorway of the trailer, sheepish.
_KELLY (cont'd)
_I wanted it ready when you got back.
The whole group stares, stunned, none more so than Malcol imself.
_MALCOLM
"Oh ... man."
_CUT TO:
EXT. BASE CAMP - LATE ater, and base camp is a blur of activity. SARAH, JUTTSON ICK, and EDDIE are hard at work, burying the remains of th ire, sealing their food in plastic bags, loading camer quipment, packing up specimen containers and othe nformation-gathering equipment ALCOLM, meanwhile, is lecturing Kelly.
_MALCOLM
"You know you were putting yourself in a potentially dangerous situation, but you didn't bother to find out how dangerous before you leapt in. You don't have the faintest idea what's going on on this island!"
_SARAH
(loading a backpack)
"What do you want to do, Ian, lock her up for curiosity? Where do you think she gets it?"
_JUTTSON
(to Nick)
"Do you have chromium tapes? The others fog in high-"
_NICK
"-humidity, I know."
(waving a tape)
"Highest lead density on the market."
_EDDIE
(to Malcolm)
"We've got a lot of heavy marching ahead of us. I'm not carrying  anybody."
_KELLY
"I can keep up."
_MALCOLM
"You're going home. I'm sending a radio call for the boats. We'll all go down to the lagoon and wait for them."
_SARAH
"Lighten up, Ian, you sound like a high school vice-principal."
_MALCOLM
"I'm her father."
_KELLY
"Sure, now."
Nick leans over and whispers to Eddie, gesturing to Malcol nd Kelly.
_NICK
"Do you see any family resemblance here?"
_MALCOLM
"You can't stay, Kelly, that's it. It's too dangerous."
_SARAH
"If it's so dangerous, why'd you bring any of us?"
_KELLY
"You're wrong, Dad. I do know what's going on on this island."
_MALCOLM
"How could you possibly?"
_KELLY
"Because you said so. Maybe nobody else believed you, but I always did."
He looks at her, touched. Nick mutters to Eddie again.
_NICK
"The kid scores with cheap sentiment."
_SARAH
"Ian, if we recall the boat now, we've made two invasive landings in one day. That'll have to go in any paper I write, and it will leave room for people to say our findings were contaminated. You know the academic world as well as I do, once they smell blood in the water, you're dead. Our presence has got to be one hundred percent antiseptic. That means if we bend a blade of grass, we bend it right back the way it-"
A low sound has been rising while she speaks, and now it come OOMING over the jungle around them, a THUNDEROUS racket tha hakes the very ground beneath them. Suddenly, three C-13 ilitary cargo planes THUNDER overhead and ROAR toward th sland interior, flying very low. The planes are enormous at-assed creatures, their rear cargo doors hanging open T A RIDGE he members of the gatherer expedition hit the dirt and pee ver a ledge, watching as the airplanes bank and circle over  pecific spot ddie raises a pair of field glasses OWN BELOW uge metal equipment containers are shoved out the back of th argo bays. They SNAP off trees like matchsticks, CRUSH fla nything foolish enough to exist where they want to land ow MEN pour out the rear of the planes, their low-altitud arachutes billowing open behind them P ON THE RIDGE ick looks at Sarah.
_NICK
"You were saying something about antiseptic?"
_CUT TO:
EXT. HUNTERS' CAMP - DA etal container doors CLANG to the ground, jeep engines ROA o life in a cloud of thick black diesel smoke, blue lase arriers SIZZLE and BURN through foliage as this group o UNTERS establishes a perimeter around their new camp ETER LUDLOW, dressed in brand new Banana Republic safar ear, steps into the center of the camp and surveys th urroundings. He turns to DR. ROBERT BURKE, a ragged ony-tailed man in wire-rimmed glasses.
_LUDLOW
"Welcome to your dream come true, Dr. Burke."
Burke has a detailed set of satellite recon photographs tha e spreads out on the hood of a jeep.
_BURKE
"I believe the large herbivores forage in open plains, like bison, which would explain the great variety of heat dots we're reading in the flatlands around this waterhole. Right -- here."
_LUDLOW
"Then that's where we're going."
Burke flips open a manifest that he will carry with him at al imes. Inside, there are dozens of sketches of various kind nderneath. As each vehicle ROARS out of the equipmen ontainer, Burke slips a waterproof eight by ten card with a con of the various dinosaurs on the island into a slot in th ashboard.
_BURKE
(calling them off)
"Hadrosaurus! Carinthosaurus! Maiasaurus!"
As the procession goes on, Ludlow turns to DIETER STARK, th an we saw welding earlier.
_LUDLOW
"This is as good a place as any for base camp. First priority is the laser barriers, I want them all up and running in thirty minutes. Half an hour, understand?"
Dieter nods and turns to some of the HUNTERS, who number abou wenty in all, that are working nearby. But someone steps i ront of Dieter, cutting him off. It's ROLAND TEMBO, th unter from the bar in Mombassa.
_ROLAND
"Cancel that, Dieter."
_LUDLOW
"What? Why?"
Roland points to a stream running nearby.
_ROLAND
"Carnivores hunt near stream beds. Do you want to set up base camp or an all-you-can-eat people bar?"
_LUDLOW
(thinks)
"You heard his, Dieter. Find a new spot. And remember, we're after herbivores only -- no unnecessary risks."
Dieter SIGHS and goes to work. Roland puts an arm aroun udlow and pulls him aside.
_ROLAND
"Peter, if you want me to run your little camping trip, there are two conditions. First -- I'm in charge, and when I'm not around, Dieter is. Your job is to sign the checks, tell us we're doing a good job, and open your case of scotch when we have a good day. Second condition -- my fee. You can keep it. All I want in exchange for my services is the right to hunt one of the tyrannosaurs. A male. Buck only. Why and how are my business. If you don't like either of those conditions, you're on your own. Go ahead and set up your camp right here, or in a swamp, or in the middle of a rex nest, for all I care. But I've been on too many safaris with rich dentists to listen to any more suicidal ideas. Okay?"
_LUDLOW
(what else can he say?)
"Okay."
_ROLAND
"Good lad."
_CUT TO:
EXT. JUNGL he jungle foliage shivers, quakes, and finally falls as th unters' convoy ROARS into the hart of the jungle. DIETE TARK stands in the front of the lead vehicle, the
"speedbird," waving the convoy forward, his Driver (CARTER) at
the wheel beside him UDLOW is in the back seat of the speedbird next to DR. BURKE OLAND and AJAY, his tracker, are in the second jeep. The ook up as the brakelights on the speedbird flash and the ca tops, forcing the rest of the convoy to halt as well n the front, the speedbird flashes its lights at something i ront of it. Dieter climbs out, plainly irritated. He walk round the front of the car and sees - - four PACHYCEPHALOSAURS eating grass in the middle of th ungle trail. They're about five feet tall, thick, heavy-se nimals whose distinctive feature is an enormous skull casing  tall, impressive crown that rises on the tops of thei eads. Dieter doesn't seem impressed. He looks back a udlow, who look at Dr. Burke urke stands up in his seat, a look of wonder on his face.
_BURKE
"Pachycephalosaurus!"
_LUDLOW
"Carnivore?"
_BURKE
(enchanted)
"Huh? No! No, herbivore, late Cretaceous. Very unusual plant eater, see that distinctive domed skull? That's nine inches of solid bone."
_LUDLOW
(who cares?)
"Just get them out of the way, Dieter."
_DIETER
"COME ON, MOVE IT!!"
The pachys look up at him sluggishly, still eating, like cow hewing their cuds. As unimpressive with him as he is wit hem, they go back to their grass.
_DIETER (cont'd)
"Oh, for God's --"
He slings his rifle off his shoulder and aims it at th losest animal. Behind him, Roland has climbed out of th econd jeep.
_ROLAND
"Dieter. This is a round-up, not a war. Use your powers of persuasion."
Dieter gestures to the speedbird to pull ahead, which it does lowly, toward the animals. The pachys look up, alert, but d ot move. Dieter walks toward them.
_DIETER
"Come on, come on, don't have all day!"
_BURKE
(going on to no one in
 particular)
"See, the pachy's neck attaches at the bottom of its skull instead of the back of its head, as with reptiles."
The speedbird draws closer. The first pachy stares at i ntently. The lead vehicle gets closer, closer - - and BANGS into the pachy, knocking it back a few feet, ou f the way.
_BURKE (cont'd)
"So when it lowers its head, its neck lines up directly with its backbone --"
BEHIND DIETER jay is staring at something on the ground at his feet. H akes a few steps further into the foliage, then turns bac oward Roland.
_AJAY
"Roland."
UP AT THE FRONT he pachys turn and hop away. Dieter turns and heads back t he speedbird. As he reaches for the door, a VOICE calls
"look out!" from behind him. Dieter spins around, just in
time to see - - the first pachy in full charge. It SLAMS headfirst int he speedbird, SMASHING the headlights and denting the grill.
_BURKE
(concluding his lecture)
"Which is perfect for absorbing impact."
Dieter turns and runs around to the front of the car. Th achy has backed up for another run and is now CHARGING RIGH T HIM ieter retreats, quickly, and rips open the passenger door t rotect himself LAM! The pachy clobbers the door, sending Dieter flyin gainst the car, knocking the wind out of him n the other jeeps, the rest of the HUNTERS stand up or lea ut the window for a better look, laughing OW!! The pachy head-butts the tire next to Dieter. I ounces off, tumbles to the ground, and rolls to its feet a ieter gets to his knees and crawls toward the back of th peedbird ut the pachy is quicker and lunges at Dieter again. He' orced to hit the dirt and crawls quickly underneath th peedbird, just as the animal SLAMS into the rear of th ehicle ow the other three animals join the jun. Ludlow and th river have to cover their heads as the animals lunge at th ar again and again, SMASHING the steel-meshed windows an ANGLING the quarter panels. The rest of the group watches astly amused  FEW STEPS INTO THE JUNGLE jay and Roland are staring at something on the ground -- a nimal footprint, three-toed, enormous.
_AJAY
"It matches the pictures."
_ROLAND
"It certainly does."
Roland gets up and goes back to his vehicle, ignoring th achy demolition derby that continues up at the speedbird oland opens a case in the back of the jeep, revealing - - his gun. It's an antique elephant gun, a double barrele 600 Nitro Express. Nearly a hundred years old, it's still i mmaculate condition, its rosewood stock buttery smooth isons delicately engraved along its silver breach he barrels are twenty-four inches long, topped with an ivor ead foresight at the business end. Roland scoops up the gun reaks the breach, and pulls two rounds of ammunition from hi hirt pocket our inches long and three-quarters of an inch in diameter hese are the largest full metal jacket cartridges ever made e slips one into each barrel and heads back into the bush oland pauses before he goes, as if noticing the animal rashing the speedbird for the first time.

"HEY!"
The pachys all freeze, staring at him. Roland waves one hand ISSES sharply between his teeth - - and the pachys scatter, back into the jungle. Takes car f that problem. Roland turns and heads back into the jungle alling out over his shoulder to Ludlow.
_ROLAND (cont'd)
"Don't worry about us. We'll catch up."
_LUDLOW
"Where do you think you're going?!"

Her eyes fall on Nick. She holds out her hand, urgently.
_SARAH (cont'd)
"Spit!"
He spits his bubblegum into the palm of her hand. The bab ex CRIES OUT again XT. HIGH HIDE - NIGH rom the swaying jungle, there is another answering ROAR nd this one's closer n the high hide, the rest of the group stares, trembling. I he distance, a flock of birds SHRIEKS and takes flight as th ops of some trees move, a whole section of forest suddenl oming alive, as if brushed by wind ut it's not the wind hey hear noises, THUDS in the jungle. And then anothe ection of forest trembles. Closer. Another flock of bird ursts out of the treetops and swarms past the high hide.
_KELLY
"What is it?"
Dr. Juttson puts an arm around Kelly, instinctively pullin er closer to him. Eddie WHISPERS urgently into th alkie-talkie.
_EDDIE
"Sarah, come in!"
_JUTTSON
"It's moving. Fast."
INT. TRAILER - NIGH here is a radio box mounted on the far wall of the trailer he speaker BUZZES urgently with Eddie's VOICE.
_EDDIE (o.s.)
"Sarah, Malcolm, can you hear me?!"
On the table, Sarah is frantically molding Nick's bubblegu nto place on the makeshift splint. But the baby rex egaining its strength, is thrashing again.
_SARAH
"Hold it down, Nick!"
_NICK
"I'm trying!"
_EDDIE (o.s.)
(from the radio)
"Is anybody there?!"
Malcolm moves to answer the radio, but Sarah SHOUTS to him.
_SARAH
"Ian, get the bottle of amoxicillin and fill a syringe! Quick injection of antibiotics and I can get it out of here!"
Forsaking the radio, Malcolm moves to the medicine drawer an omes up with what she wants. Working fast, he draws twent c's of the pink liquid.
_EDDIE (o.s.)
(still from the radio, now
 desperate)
"SARAH OR IAN, ANSWER ME!"
They ignore him as Sarah grabs the syringe and makes th njection.
_EDDIE (o.s.)
"WHATEVER YOU BROUGHT INTO THE TRAILER, GET IT OUT NOW!"
EXT. HIGH HIDE - NIGH ddie has given up on whispering as he clutches the radi esperately.
_EDDIE
"WE ESTIMATE TWO LARGE ADULTS HEADED IN YOUR DIRECTION! I REPEAT --"
INT. TRAILER - NIGH ick, Sarah, and Malcolm spin around at hearing that terribl iece of information.
_MALCOLM
"Oh, Christ."
He bolts over to the wall speaker and hits the button.
_MALCOLM (cont'd)
"Let me talk to Kelly, is she--"
A deafening ROAR sound from just outside the trailer ollowed immediately by a CRASHING sound. They whirl and loo o the window, just in time to see - - the AAV tumbling by, rolling on its side here is another ROAR, and the baby, on the table, ROARS i esponse. Outside the window, the head of a full-grow YRANNOSAURUS REX lowers and peers inside alcolm, Sarah, and Nick all freeze in absolute terror he rex outside GURGLES, making material cooing noises. Th aby rex, calm for the first time, GURGLES back ut across the trailer, in the opposite window, ANOTHER T-RE EAD SUDDENLY APPEARS his one ROARS, deeply, a roar so low and loud it rattle nything in the trailer that isn't tied down.
_NICK
"What do they want?!"
_MALCOLM
"What do you think they want?!"
_SARAH
"That's impossible, they can't have the sensory equipment to track it all the way here!"
_MALCOLM
"Current evidence seems to be to the contrary, wouldn't you say?! GIVE IT TO THEM!"
Nick, hands shaking, grabs the shoulder video camera he use arlier. He whips out the cassette that's in there, hurls i nto an open duffel bag with half a dozen others, SLAMS  resh cassette in, and flicks the "ON" switch arah and Malcolm, meanwhile, hurry to the other end of th railer, carrying the baby rex. Outside, the two adult rexe tay with them, walking in the same direction, watching the hrough the window XT. TRAILER - NIGH een from outside, the light inside the trailers clearl lluminates Sarah and Malcolm as they carry the bay rex. Th dult rexes tower over the trailer, twice as tall and nearl s long. They walk slowly alongside it, hunched over atching their infant NT. TRAILER - NIGH t the door to the trailer, Sarah un-muzzles the frantic baby.
_SARAH
"Ready?"
Malcolm reaches for the door handle.
_NICK
"Wait!"
He dives down on the floor under them, pointing the vide amera up at the door, getting the best shot. Malcolm takes  reath, turns the knob, and throws open the door utside, the enormous rex heads pause for a moment, staring urprised lthough terrified, Sarah actually starts to sing.
_SARAH
(softly)
"Born free, as free as the wind blows. As free as the grass grows --"
_MALCOLM
"Are you insane?!"
_SARAH
"I swear to God, it works with lions sometimes! There we are -- your baby is free --"
The baby, excited, wriggles free of them and lands on th round outside. Not wasting a second, Malcolm SLAMS the doo hut he three of them freeze, not daring to breath. Outside, the an hear the SNUFFLING and COOING of the animals as the nspect their young - - and then the soft THUD of their footsteps, growing fainte s they move away rom the wall, EDDIE'S VOICE comes over the radio, relieved.
_EDDIE
"They're going back into the jungle."
_CUT TO:
EXT. HIGH HIDE - NIGH DDIE, JUTTSON, and KELLY sag back against the railings of th igh hide.
_EDDIE
"Thank God. Thank God."
MALCOLM'S VOICE comes over the radio.
_MALCOLM (o.s.)
"Kelly? Are you all right?"
She takes the radio, her voice shaky.
_KELLY
"Uh huh."
_CUT TO:
INT. TRAILER - NIGH ALCOLM is at the radio.
_MALCOLM
"Wait there. I'll come up in a minute. Don't move, understand?"
_KELLY (o.s.)
"I understand."
Malcolm slump against the wall of the trailer. SARAH an ICK sit on the floor leaning against the opposite wall ompletely drained. Sarah pulls out her pocket recorder an peaks shakily into it.
_SARAH
"Note to Dr. Juttson -- Tyrannosaurus rex does nurture its young."
They laugh weakly.
_NICK
"There's, uh -- there's an unwritten rule when a news crew is in a war zone. You stop the van every two miles and decide whether or not to go on. Whether or not you feel lucky. One "no" from anybody in the group and you turn around right there, no question asked, nobody embarrassed."
(pause)
"Well? Do we go on?"
Immediately:
_SARAH
"No."
_MALCOLM
"No."
_NICK
"No way."
They all laugh.
_MALCOLM
"All right. I'm satisfied with the evidence we have right now. I feel vindicated. John Hammond will too."
(to Sarah)
"Do you have enough to publish?"
_SARAH
"They will come after me. But I can collect some stool samples, for DNA with that, Nick's tapes, and the rest of you to back me up, it should stand when we get back."
_MALCOLM
(getting up)
"Then the only thing left to do is make sure we do get back. I'll call the mainland on the satellite phone and have them send the boat right now. This expedition is over."
He goes to the desk and picks up the heavy gray satellit hone that's resting in a battery pack. The front pane ights up, a brilliant green ut from the wall speaker, the radio CRACKLES and EDDIE' OICE breaks through, soft and empty.
_EDDIE (o.s.)
"Oh, God. I am so sorry."
Malcolm and Sarah look at the speaker box.
_MALCOLM
"What the hell is he sorry f-"
A low RATTLE sneaks into the trailer. Malcolm, Sarah, an ick takes a step forward from the walls, looking around. Th ATTLE gets louder, the trailer shakes and vibrates verything in it starts to BANG against the walls - - and something huge SMASHES into the side of the trailer hey're all thrown against the far wall, there is a arsplitting CRACK of electricity, the entire trailer rock nd sparks a brilliant blue, and then everything goes black he satellite phone flies out of Malcolm's hands and SMACK gainst the wall. It lands on the floor, its number pad stil lowing green ick crawls over and looks out one of the windows. Outside he flank of one of the tyrannosaurs wipes past the window evealing the second tyrannosaur, charging straight at th railer!
_NICK
"HANG ON TO SOMETHING!"
They hurl themselves at the nearest solid object and hang o or dear life. The charging rex SLAM into the side of th railer, which rocks up on one side, BANGS back down, and i uickly RAMMED again by the furious animal. This time th ntire trailer rolls over, completely upside down arah, Nick, and Malcolm let go of their precarious handhold nd drop onto the ceiling. The tables, chairs, lab equipment verything that's bolted down clings to the floor above them verything that isn't RAINS DOWN ON THEM ut the rexes aren't done. The trailer JOLTS INTO MOTION liding forwards EEN FROM OUTSIDE he upside down trailer, which is the rear of the tw railers, slides along the muddy ground, pushing up earth i ront of it N THE TRAILER,
_SARAH
"They're pushing us!"
Malcolm, frantic, crawls up to a window to get a look outside e looks down and sees a T-rex footprint in the earth outsid s they move past it e cranks his head to get a look at the direction in whic hey are being pushed. His eyes widen at something he see utside the window.
_MALCOLM
"Oh, God."
_SARAH
"What?!"
_MALCOLM
"They're pushing us over the cliff."
Sure enough, out the back window, we see a few more feet o uddy earth, and then nothing but inky black. The three o hem look at each other for a moment - - and then crawl like hell toward the other end of th railer. The opposite end reaches the edge of the cliff an tarts up to tip ever-so-slightly downward. They reach th ccordion-like connector and Malcolm crawls into it HROUGH THE WINDSHIELD OF THE FRONT TRAILER hich is right-side-up, Malcolm can see the two rexes hard a t, pushing the front end of the trailer N THE REAR TRAILER ick has a pretty good grip at the top of the trailer, bu arah can only cling to an air vent in the ceiling as stuf tarts to roll and tumble past her, headed downhill he angle increases, the trailer dips, and now stuff starts t reefall, right past her, some SMASHING her in the head alcolm, still in the connecting tube, grabs hold. Sarah tarting to be pulled downward, paws at the refrigerator etting a g rip on the handle. The door, held by a safet atch, doesn't open elow Sarah, debris falls to the rear window of the trailer hrough the CRACKING glass, we can see the surf, CRASHING fiv undred feet below he refrigerator bolts suddenly CRUNCH free of the wall. Th ox strains on its power cord till clinging to the handle, Sarah swings wildly as it start o come loose, swaying above her he safety latch on the door gives, it swings open, and  hower of food BANGS off of her as gravity empties th ontents arah loses her grip and plummets through the now-vertica railer. She SCREAMS, covers her head, and SMASHES into th ear window. The glass spiderwebs, but does not break IVE HUNDRED FEET BELOW n enormous wave POUNDS the rocky shore. Above, Sarah is  iny figure, sprawled out on the glass, held invisibly by th reaking window N THE TRAILER ick SHOUTS to her.
_NICK
"SARAH! DON'T MOVE!"
Sarah, stunned by the fall, blinks a few times, regaining he enses. She looks down, at the crashing surf so far below or a person with a fear of heights, this is a real drag. A he stares, the rocks seem to move even farther away from her he blanches; the world spins around her.
_SARAH
"OH... GOD ... please..."
Her breath fogs the cracked glass. Slowly, she tries to ge p, caaaaaarefully pulling herself up to her hands and knees ut as she puts pressures on her hands, the glass CRACKS eve ore, tiny spiderwebs shooting out around her fingers. Th hole glass panel sags, bowing out around the bottom of th railer P ABOVE HER alcolm looks down and sees the satellite phone precariousl alanced on one leg of the kitchen table, its number pad stil lowing green. Nick is closest to it.
_MALCOLM
"Nick! Grab the phone!"
SARA ooks to her right, at a metal grating that runs along th all of the trailer. She shifts her weight, leaning on on and to reach for the grating with the other IC eaches for the satellite phone, its antenna just six inche rom his outstretched fingers ARA eans toward the metal grating, all hairline cracks shoot ou round her pivot hand, shaking through the glass. Th plintered glass spread like a disease, it reaches the edg f the frame - - and her hand CRACKS right through the glass. She GASPS an ulls her hand out, but now she knees SMASH through th lass IC as two fingers on the phone, but suddenly the whole traile hudders and the heavy phone tips off the table leg and falls.
_NICK
"SARAH LOOK OUT!"
SARA unges for the metal grating and clings to it just as th eavy phone whizzes past her head and SMASHES into the glass pening up a huge hole in the center of the back window NDERNEATH THE TRAILER lass, food, lab equipment, and the precious satellite phon all out the broken window and SMASH on the rocks far below N THE CLEANING he trailers are split, like an L, the rear trailer hangin traight down, the forward one resting on the edge of th liff. Satisfied with their work, the T-rexes turn and lumbe ack into the jungle N THE TRAILER arah climbs carefully up the metal grating. Above her, Nic owers himself as far as he can, reaching for her N THE CLIFFSIDE e realize the hanging trailer halted its descent because on orner of it is wedged in the branches of a tree that grow ut from the muddy cliff ut now those branches SPLINTER N THE TRAILER alcolm sees the bellows, the connector between the trailers tretch as the lower trailer JERKS and dips lower ELOW HIM arah mountain-climbs through the trailer's kitchen nadvertently kicking the faucet on as she struggles fo urchase UTSIDE he tree branch SNAPS and the trailer jerks, stretching dow gain. The bellows expands to its full length, stretchin ike a Slinky NSIDE ick knows he has to hurry. He climbs down, bouncing off th uilt-in furniture, moving ever closer to Sarah ut Sarah slips and loses her grip, dropping a few feet. Sh abs hold of the sink, the flowing water spraying her face XT. JUNGLE - NIGH DDIE CARR is in the driver's seat of the jeep, racing throug he jungle as fast as he can.
_EDDIE
"Hang on -- hang on --"
The foliage SMACKS the windshield, then clears suddenly evealing the endangered trailers on the cliffside ahead o im. The jeep bounces through the deep footprints left by th ex and SKIDS to a halt NT. TRAILER - NIGH arah loses her grip on the sink and falls, SMASHING into th rame of the half-broken rear window again UTSIDE ddie bolts out of the car and runs to the front trailer. H HOUTS in through the broken front window.
_EDDIE
"HEY! HELLO?!"
IN THE REAR TRAILER he three look up from their precarious positions.
_MALCOLM
"WE'RE IN HERE! GET SOME ROPE!"
OUTSIDE ddie turns and run back to the jeep. He grabs a coil o ope, secures one end around a tree, and hurries back to th railer N THE REAR TRAILER ddie dashes over the mess in the front trailer and crawls ou nto the extended connector. He peers over the edge, dow nto the second trailer, and tosses the rope.
_EDDIE
"Catch!"
The rope falls through the center of the trailer, its en angling all the way out the smashed rear window. But th railer SHUDDERS, starting to move again.
_SARAH
"We're sliding!"
_EDDIE
"Climbs up if you can!"
OUTSIDE ddie runs out of the trailer in time to see the wheel ragging forward through the mud as the weight of the danglin railer pulls the whole thing toward the edge of the cliff e runs for the jeep and grabs hold of the power winch on th ront grill ehind him, the trailer rolls closer to the edge of the cliff ddie races back to the trailer, pulling out a length of cabl ehind him. He runs up to the still-moving trailer, dives fo ts towing hook, the cable goes taut - - and he falls short. Just by six inches, but he's out o able.
_EDDIE
"Damn it!"
INSIDE THE TRAILER ick and Sarah are now together, clinging to the rope near th ottom of the trailer as it shifts around them. Malcolm i urther up, also clinging to the rope UTSIDE irt and rocks pile up around the wheels and spill over th dge of the cliff ddie, back at the jeep, reels out more winch cable. He turn nd races back to the trailer just as gravity starts to LIF HE FRONT END OFF THE GROUND ddie dives again, and this time the cable hook CLICK ecurely into the trailer's towing hook. The trailer lurche oward the edge of the cliff and stops ut the jeep is jerked forward by the sudden pressure N THE TRAILER alcolm clings to the rope in the middle of the trailer whil ick and Sarah try to struggle up it, but a sudden dig knock hem back, and their hands slide down the line. SCREAMING hey slide through the trailer and their feet SMASH throug he remains of the rear window egaining hold of the rope at the very end, the two of the ow find themselves hanging out of the rear end of the trailer angling over the rocky shore below N THE JEEP ddie hits the gas and the tires slosh in the mud, trying t et a grip. The jeep pulls just enough to lower the fron railer back to earth. But the tires spin, fighting to hol t there N THE CLIFFSID arah and Nick dangle, desperate N THE JEE ddie CHUNKS the shifter into four wheel drive and GUNS th ngine. As the motor ROARS, the sound is topped by anothe OAR, in the distance nd this one's not a machine. But Eddie doesn't hear it. H UNS the engine again. There is another ROAR from the jungle ddie hears this one. He darts a look at the side vie irror. In it, he sees one of the TYRANNOSAURS bolt out o he jungle behind him e GASPS and looks at the other side view. In it, he sees th THER REX racing toward him he tyrannosaurs STOMP forward to confront the ROARING jeep he first rex bends over, CHOMPS down on the rear tire, an ifts the car to its teeth ut the spinning tire LINGS in the rex's mouth, burning it urprised by the fight in this foe, the rex loses its grip an he jeep BANGS back down onto the ground ddie, horrified, dives down under the steering wheel, to ge way. The gas pedal pops up - - which makes the trailer pitch over the side of the cliff ut the rex STOMPS down on the jeep to prevent its escape he trailers stop ow the rexes lean down, over the jeep, and focus on Eddie ho still covers under the steering wheel. The first re NAPS at him, hitting the steering column with it, leaving Eddie full xposed e SCREAMS and the second rex lashes in, seizing him in it eeth and tossing him out of the car ddie pops up into the air between the two rexes, both thei eads flash at him at the same time, and in a split-second, h isappears between their teeth ow completely ignored, the jeep rolls freely forward and th railers drop over the edge of the cliff NSIDE THE TRAILER ick, Sarah and Malcolm cling to each other and the rope a he trailers fall around them. The windows flash by as th railers plummet, equipment BANGS and SCRAPES them, but the old on to the rope, still tied to the tree, for dear life N THE CLIFFSIDE he trailers slide the rest of the way, exposing the three ho pop out the space where the front windshield was angling from the rope, they look up and see the jeep, whic s now rolling to the edge of the cliff t falls, past them, and the whole mess EXPLODES on the rock elow. Finally, it is silent, except for the sound of th urf XT. CLEARING - NIGH t's quiet up here too, the rexes nowhere to be seen. At th liff, a hand appears from over the edge. Then another ARAH pulls herself up, back onto solid ground, then come ICK, then both of them reach over and help MALCOLM up ove he edge hey collapse there, in the mud, completely exhausted.
_MALCOLM
(softly)
"Eddie?"
He looks at the other two. They glance around, then dro heir heads. Sarah hears a SOUND in the distance.
_SARAH
"Oh, God. Now what?"
From the edge of the jungle, a cris-cross of flashlight beam oves toward them. But rather than the three or four tha ould signify their own group, there are nearly twenty o hem he HUNTERS, PETER LUDLOW is in the lead, ROLAND and AJA ith him. DIETER is there too, shepherding KELLY and DR UTTSON along in front of him alcolm sees Kelly, they call out to each other, and rac ogether. Malcolm falls to his knees and hugs her as tightl s he possibly can.
_MALCOLM
"Are you all right?! Anything broken?"
_KELLY
"I'm fine, I'm fine, I was scared, I thought you, are you okay?!"
_MALCOLM
"I'm fine... I'm fine..."
Roland looks around, at the mess that was their base camp.
_ROLAND
(mostly to himself)
"That's what you think."
_CUT TO:
EXT. RUINED BASE CAMP - NIGH n the ruins of the first team's base camp, the survivors o he night's two separate catastrophes stand face to face, in  eated argument ALCOLM sits off to the side, still holding Kelly in his arms ust looking down at the ground and shaking his head. There' omething about his posture of defeat that is far more ominou han any of the hot tempers that are flaring. LUDLOW rants t ARAH while DIETER looms menacingly over NICK.
_LUDLOW
"Trespassing, sabotage -- you could go to jail just for being here, did you know that?"
_SARAH
"Don't start a legal argument with me, this island isn't your property, and neither are these animals!"
DR. JUTTSON has encountered DR. BURKE.
_JUTTSON
"What are you doing here, Burke? There's no TV cameras, what's the point?"
_BURKE
"Dr. Juttson, you exist outside the classroom. I am amazed."
Dieter continues to get in Nick's face.
_NICK
"Are you looking for a problem?"
_JUTTSON
(an urgent whisper)
"Everyone, keep your voices down!"
_ROLAND
"Back off, Dieter."
_JUTTSON
"Listen to me, by moving the baby rex into our camp, we changed the adults' perceived territory!"
_LUDLOW
"Their what?"
_SARAH
(she understands)
"Oh, God."
_JUTTSON
"That's why they persisted in destroying the trailers, they now feel they have to defend this entire area! We're not safe here."
_LUDLOW
(of Sarah and Nick)
"Thanks to you people."
_SARAH
"Hey, we came here to observe, you came here to strip-mine the place! It's a looter mentality, all you care about is what you can take."
_ROLAND
"None of that matters. Our communications equipment's been destroyed. If your radio and satellite phone were in those trailers that went off the cliff, and I'm guessing by the look on his face --"
He points at Malcolm, who is still off to the side, sitting i tunned silence. Malcolm looks up and nods, slowly. Th rimness of their situation sinks in.
_ROLAND (cont'd)
"We are stuck here, ladies and gentlemen. And we're stuck together."
_CUT TO:
EXT. HUNTERS' CAMP - NIGH ack in the hunters' now-demolished camp, members of the tw roups combine their diminished supplies. They have half  ozen large plastic containers of water, thirty-seve ontainers of food, ranging from Ziploc bags to aluminum tins  variety of weapons, mot of them borne on the hips o houlders of the HUNTER team, the charred and scraggl emnants of several pieces of now-useless electrica quipment, a flare gun and several flares, somebody's tattere aperback ("Crime and Punishment"), a box of Hershey bars, an  cartoon of Marlboros OLAND supervises the assembling of the resources, which ar isplayed in front of him. LUDLOW, NICK, SARAH, JUTTSON, an ALCOLM, who is still holding KELLY close to him, are wit im. They hold their discussion in quiet tones.
_ROLAND
"If we can't stay in the rex's territory, we have to move tonight."
_SARAH
"Move where? Our boat's not coming for two days, your airlift is waiting for an order you have no way to send --"
Ludlow refers to the charred and trampled satellit hotographs of the island, which are still mostly legible.
_LUDLOW
"There's a communication center, here, in the old worker village. Hammond put in some kind of renewable power source replenishing. It may still work. If we could get there, we could send a radio call for the airlift."
_NICK
"How far is the village?"
_LUDLOW
"I said if we could get there."
_NICK
"Well, how far is it?"
_LUDLOW
"A day's walk, maybe more. That's not the problem."
_ROLAND
"What is?"
_LUDLOW
"The velociraptors."
Malcolm looks up sharply.
_LUDLOW (cont'd)
"Our infrareds show their nesting sites are concentrated in the island interior. That's why we planned on keeping to the outer rim."
Malcolm shepherds Kelly away from the conversation and mutter omething to her quietly in the background.
_DIETER
"What are velociraptors?"
_JUTTSON
"Carnivores. Pack hunters. About six feet long, three or four hundred pounds, and very, very fast."
Dieter brandishes his weapon.
_DIETER
"I think we can handle ourselves against them."
Malcolm rejoins the conversation, alone. He keeps his voic ow.
_MALCOLM
"No. I'm quite certain you can't."
_ROLAND
"Look, we have two choices. We can hike back down to the lagoon, where we can sit for two days, in the open, next to a heavily used water source while we're waiting for your boat to arrive, or we can head for the village, where we might find some shelter and we can call for help."
_MALCOLM
"We'd never make it past the raptors. Trust me, I have some experience in this matter."
Roland looks at him.
_ROLAND
"That may be. But you weren't with me at the time."
Malcolm just shakes his head, then turns and walks back t elly. Roland turns to the others.
_ROLAND (cont'd)
"Load up. Let's get this moveable feast underway."
_CUT TO:
EXT. ISLAND - NIGH he SURVIVORS set forth, marching through the jungle in  olumn. Two HUNTERS strap on small shoulder-mounte ervo-flashlights. Wires run from the lights end i ensor pads which they stick to the skin of their necks. Thu ttached, when the hunters turn their heads, the servo-light urn with them, illuminating whatever direction they look in ALCOLM screws the barrel into the Lindstradt rifle and sling t over his shoulder as he marches, limping heavily. He look own at KELLY, who is marching alongside him. His face show he deepest of regret. He shakes his head, cursing himself.
_MALCOLM
"Damn it."
He looks away as Kelly looks up at him, questioning. ROLAN alls into step with Malcolm and notices his limp.
_ROLAND
"You all right?"
Malcolm looks at him, then looks away without answering.
_ROLAND (cont'd)
"Wrong question?"
_MALCOLM
"You ever heard of Gambler's Ruin?"
_ROLAND
"What's that?"
_MALCOLM
"A statistical phenomenon. Says everything in the world goes in streaks. It's real, you see it everywhere -- in weather, in river flooding, in baseball, in blackjack, in stock markets. Once things go bad, they tend to stay bad. Bad things cluster. They go to hell together."
_ROLAND
"Feeling a bit blue, are we?"
Malcolm glances at Kelly, who has taken a slightly faster pac nd is a few steps ahead of them now.
_MALCOLM
"Just -- flawed. Very deeply flawed."
_ROLAND
"Why did you come here?"
_MALCOLM
"So that others would know about this place?"
_ROLAND
"Why should they?"
_MALCOLM
"Because it exists."
_ROLAND
"It'll still exit if they go on not knowing, won't it?"
_MALCOLM
"Yes. And people will live in the absence of truth."
_ROLAND
"So the truth is more important to you than your life?"
_MALCOLM
(lowers is voice)
"I don't care about my life. But if I'd ever thought for a second that she would be in danger --"
Roland follows his gaze forward, to Kelly, who's about te ards ahead now.
_ROLAND
"She yours?"
AHEAD OF THEM elly can hear their voices, faint, but clear. They are no s far away as they think they are.
_MALCOLM (o.s.)
"I'm afraid so. I don't know what the hell I'm doing with kids. I never should have had her."
Kelly's face shows she heard that part EHIND HER alcolm, unaware, continues with Roland.
_MALCOLM (cont'd)
"Why are you here?"
_ROLAND
"Somewhere on this island, there exits the greatest predator that ever lived. And the second greatest predator must take him down."
_MALCOLM
"But why?"
_ROLAND
"You remember that guy, about twenty years ago, I forget his name, but he climbed Everest without any oxygen, came down almost dead. And they asked him, "why did you go up there to die?" And he said "I didn't. I went up there to live.""
_MALCOLM
(nods)
"It's called self-testing. But in your case, it sounds more like self-destruction. A uniquely human characteristic. In fact, human beings destroy things so well that I sometimes think that's our function. Maybe every few sons, some animal comes along that kills off the rest of the world, clears the decks, and lets evolution proceed to his next phase. Maybe death and destruction are our job, maybe we're supposed to destroy ourselves and every other living thing that-"
Every person on the trail within earshot has stopped and i taring at Malcolm, shaken by his words. Roland grabs Malcol y the shirt collar and pulls him close, GROWLING in his ear.
_ROLAND
"Tell you what. You can see whatever you want to, to me, but you will not spew any more nihilist rants at anyone else in the group. I'm fighting panic, and you push the wrong buttons. Understand?"
Malcolm just blinks. This guy's in charge.
_CUT TO:
EXT. JUNGLE - DAW s a purple dawn dissolves the night sky, the SURVIVOR tagger on, exhausted. Some are starting to tire, and ther re spaces in the column. MALCOLM's limp seems to be gettin orse. NICK reaches out, to take Malcolm's pack, but Malcol wats his hand away ELLY, still ahead of him, falls into step with SARAH.
_KELLY
"I don't think -- my dad doesn't think we're going to make it."
Sarah looks at her.
_SARAH
"Your dad is wrong. About a lot more than he knows."
She puts an arm around her. Kelly looks up at her, grateful he long march continues P AT THE FRONT ICK catches up to ROLAND.
_NICK
"I think you should call a break."
_ROLAND
"Another half hour."
_NICK
"Some of them won't make another half hour. We didn't come this far to start dropping in the middle of the jungle. If you don't call it, I will."
Roland looks at him, steely, then SHOUTS to the group.
_ROLAND
"FIVE MINUTES BREAK!"
Immediately, the marchers drop where they stood, absolutel rained T THE REAR OF THE GROUP RS. BURKE and JUTTSON are bickering.
_JUTTSON
"I can't believe you're still angry about that."
_BURKE
"You know, it's very easy to criticize the first person who studies something."
_JUTTSON
"No, it's easy to criticize sloppy research and hasty conclusions."
NEARBY ALCOLM checks Nick's bag of videotapes, making sure they'r till dry and undamaged. Sarah comes up, watching him.
_SARAH
"You know, even if we do get those tapes back, people are going to say it's just another hoax. Ian Malcolm's alien autopsy."
_MALCOLM
"Maybe. Maybe not."
_SARAH
"Ian, they will misplace our evidence, shoot holes in our testimony, and say some special effects genius created the animals. The only way people will ever believe that dinosaurs exist is if you dump a T-rex in the middle of times Square."
He doesn't look at her. She sits down beside her.
_SARAH (cont'd)
"There's something more important that you should be thinking about instead."
BEHIND THEM r. Burke, furious, has stalked away from Juttson and sit own on a rock. H does a double take, noticing somethin ehind the rock. He leans over and picks it up t's an oval shape about eight inches long, with a pebble xterior. A dinosaur egg urke's face lights up, fascinated, and he carefully piece he egg in a satchel he wears over one shoulder T THE REAR OF THE GROUP IETER STARK pulls a wad of toilet paper from his pack, drop he pack on the ground, and turns to the Hunter nearest him - ARTER, his driver, who has his back turned.
_DIETER
"Wait here for me, would ya Carter?"
He steps off the path, into the jungle. But as we come aroun he front of Carter, we see he's wearing a Walkman, th eadphone BLARING tinnily in his ears nd he didn't hear a word XT. THICK OF THE JUNGLE - DA nly a few feet off the path, it's primary forest, the growt o thick that almost all sunlight is obscured. DIETER claw orward until he finds a suitable spot to relieve himself e clears away a bunch of leaves and debris and raises hi and to his belt buckle. He freezes, hearing something w idn't. He glances around, head darting, alert to any danger othing there. Just a few distant ANIMAL CALLS- - and s SCURRYING around to his left ieter snaps his head in that direction. At first, he see othing, but as he moves closer, gun extended in front of him e sees a small dinosaur, a COMPSOGRATHUS, the sam hicken-sized animal Cathy saw on the beach so long ago.
_DIETER
"It's not polite to --"
He pulls the steel rod out of a loop in his belt and touche t to the compy's back. The blue bolt of electricity CRACK nd dances over the compy's body and it convulses in pain.
_DIETER (cont'd)
"-- sneak up on people."
The wounded compsognathus scurries back into the jungle himpering. Dieter clambers through the foliage ten or twelv aces, pushes aside two large palm fronds, and steps ou nto - - more jungle. He stops, puzzled, not sure if he went bac r forward e looks behind him. He pauses, recalculating the path h ook coming into the jungle, MUTTERING to himself, gesturin ith his hands, retracing his steps e adjusts his angle slightly to the right and heads off i hat direction. But after five or six hard-fought steps, h tops again. Still nothing but jungle.
_DIETER
"HEY! CARTER! YELL OR SOMETHING, I GOT TURNED AROUND IN HERE!"
ON THE TRAIL ieter's cries are faint, but audible. The only Marchers hea nough to hear him is CARTER, but the Walkman is blaring i is ears.
_DIETER (o.s.)
 ...Carter... me?...
IN THE JUNGLE ieter hears that SCURRYING sound again, this time from hi ight. He adjusts his angle again and SCRAPES through th oliage, moving faster and faster anicking, he ties to run, but the roots rise high out of th round in the jungle, and he trips on one and falls flat o is face e looks up. The SCURRYING sound comes again, this time te imes louder than before, like a hundred feet coming at him ieter GASPS as something rushes in at him e whirls to his right. Whatever it is rushes in from tha ide as well. And the left. And behind him. Diete crambles up into a sitting position - - and laughs. He is surrounded by at least forty compys now he same as the one he wounded or a long moment, they just stare at him. Slowly, he bring is gun around, to point it at them.
_DIETER
"Easy -- wait -- one more sec-"
As one, the compys SHRIEK and hurl themselves forward overing Dieter's body. Their teeth and claws FLASH as the ach try to grab a scrap of his flesh, tearing savagely ieter SCREAMS and flails, waving his arms and legs wildly ome of the tiny animals lose their grip and sail off MASHING into trees or the ground. But dozens of others han n, and Dieter falls over backwards, now lying on his back o he ground ysterical, he fights like hell to get to his feet, SCREAMING haking, swatting the compys loose. He spins, and that tacti eems to work, as the compys themselves begin to panic an rop off of him. But he also loses his grip on his weapon hich goes flying, landing in the thick foliage five or si eet from him osing the attack, the compys turn and dart away en masse topping ten yards away from him ut they turn and regroup, facing him in a line, hopping u nd down, CHIRPING and SHRIEKING ieter bounds into the foliage, looking for his gun. But th ompys follow him in and he's forced to flee, abandoning hi ost weapon en feet on, he stops, knowing he's screwed without the gun e turns to face the pursuing compys hey stop ieter charges them, SHOUTING, waving his arms he compys turn and run. Dieter stops he compys stop. They stare back at him. There is a momen f quiet, then they start to hop again, CHIRPING an QUEALING ieter, tired of this game, turns and runs away he compys follow XT. JUNGLE - DA rom the front of the convoy, ROLAND SHOUTS out.
_ROLAND
"Break's over, move on!"
The exhausted marchers drag themselves back to their feet an tart to march again. At the rear of the group, someone tap arter, who is still listening to his music. Carter gets up oists his backpack, and marches away ehind him, Dieter's pack is left, forgotten, on the jungl rail XT. DEEP IN THE JUNGLE - DA IETER stumbles along, exhausted. He reaches the edge of  tream that runs under the foliage, and his feet slip on th tones. He falls, into the rocky stream ehind him, the army of compys pours over the little hill h ust crested. They disappear for a moment, down an incline - - And then swarm over his body. In a frenzy of splashing ieter shrugs them off and crawls away, through the stream e gets to his feet but falls again, this time over a log.  eyser of water splashes up in the air behind the log a ieter drops out of sight he compys leap over the log and disappear from view too hrowing up their own splashes of water. SCREECHING HIRPING, and the sound of TEARING flesh mixes with Dieter' CREAMS ow, as more compys leap over the log and splash into th ater below, the geysers that shoot up into our field of vie re pink nd then they're a deep, deep red.
_CUT TO:
EXT. JUNGLE - DA he group has stopped again. Near the rear, SARAH, NICK ALCOLM, LUDLOW, and ROLAND are in a tense conversation wit ARTER.
_ROLAND
"How long ago was this?"
_CARTER
"Seven, eight minutes."
Roland looks at them, thinking. Finally:
_ROLAND
"Then he's dead. Nobody tells the little girl. Last thing we need is screaming hysterics."
He turns and heads back to the front of the column.
_SARAH
"We have to send someone to look for him!"
_ROLAND
"You go if you like, but we're not waiting for you. MOVE IT OUT!!"
They look at each other, appalled, but the column starts t ove. Numbed, shocked, but left with no choice, they move on ne by one.
_CUT TO:
EXT. ISLAND RIDGE - DUS he column of MARCHERS has finally reached the island ridge here they are silhouetted against the setting sun. They'r aking a break, sprawled out on rocks or over the ground ALCOLM sits next to KELLY, who's sitting on a log.
_MALCOLM
"You okay?"
She doesn't look at him, just gets up and walks away, going t it over next to SARAH alcolm watches, pained, but Sarah puts an arm around her an akes a "she's okay" gesture to Malcolm T THE RIDGE OLAND steps up to the very edge and peers into the islan nterior. From his vantage point, he's able to see all th ay to the far side of the island, a rim of herd black cliff iles away. Between here and the cliffs there is nothing bu ently undulating jungle e refers to one of the satellite recon photos.
_ROLAND
"Looks like the worker village is down in there, about a mile and a half northeast from the base of these cliffs."
MALCOLM is next to him.
_MALCOLM
"There must be a game trail, some kind of path that goes down there."
Roland looks around at the exhausted MARCHERS.
_ROLAND
"They'll have to rest before we look for it. Eat. Sleep. Two hours. Then we hit it."
_CUT TO:
EXT. CAMPSITE - NIGH he group has made camp in the jungle. The mood is somber ost of the MARCHERS asleep already. Three or four tents hav een put up N ONE TENT ELLY sits quietly in a corner, her eyes wide, knees hugged u o his chest. SARAH comes in.
_SARAH
"There you are. Your dad's looking for you."
_KELLY
"I doubt that."
Sarah takes off her outer shirt and hangs it over a bar to dr he broad red smear across its front.
_SARAH
"Oh, come on. Go talk to him."
_KELLY
"Why? He likes to be alone. I can stay with you."
IN THE CAMPSITE ll is still. The nocturnal jungle HOOTS and BUZZES aroun he sleeping marchers n his tent, ROLAND abruptly sits up. As if he hear omething. He looks out the open flap. In the middle of th ampsite, he sees AJAY stop in his tracks, head cocked oland gets up and goes outside, joining Ajay in the middle o he camp.
_ROLAND
"You hear something?"
_AJAY
"No. I feel something."
Roland looks at him. This isn't so good. He looks out at th hifting jungle. He notices a thin plume of smoke rising u ver the trees just barely outside the edge of camp.
_ROLAND
"Oh, no."
IN SARAH'S TENT elly and Sarah have laid down on top of sleeping bags, tryin o get a few minutes' rest. Sarah's shirt hangs over them waying in the gentle breeze coming through the open flap s the shirt dangles there, swinging softly from side to side e notice the broad red smear across the front. Oh, that' ight -- it's blood he baby T-rex's blood T THE RIDGE OF CAMP he thin plume of smoke leads down to a tiny cooking fir hat's been lit by DR. BURKE e's set a small frying pan on top of it, and now he CRACK he dinosaur egg he picked up earlier into the pan oland and Ajay run up behind him.
_ROLAND
(hisses)
"ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?!"
Burke leaps out of the way as Roland kicks dirt on the fire MBB oland, Ajay, and Burke all freeze. What was that N SARAH'S TENT arah and Kelly sit up. They felt it too MBB T THE COCKING FIRE,
_ROLAND
"Get my weapon."
Ajay turns and trots away a few steps, then stops cold taring down at the ground MBB  recent rain has all left puddles scattered around the camp, an mpact tremors now create ripples in the puddles -- concentri ircles spreading to the outer edges MBB N SARAH'S TENT arah and Kelly are frantically sealing up any opened foo nto Ziploc bags MBB ow they leap into Sarah's sleeping bag, to seal themselves nd draw the zipper up, all the way around utside, the silhouette of the rex's head passes by the tent arah works faster, her fingers struggling to close the las ew inches, but - - the rex head pokes through the flap of the tent. I niffs, SNORTING the air in and out. It looks around th ent t sniffs Sarah's hanging shirt, the one that is stained wit he blood of the baby tyrannosaur. The adult tyrannosau URGLES again, COOING and cocking its head curiously n the sleeping bag, Sarah and Kelly's eyes are barel isible, wide in panic. The rex sniffs and nudges the bag rying to figure out what this thing is t rolls the bag over once, decides it's uninteresting, an hen rises, straights up - - taking the whole tent with it! The stakes pop out of th round as the tent rises high up into the air and flutter way, leaving the sleeping bag fully exposed on the groun eneath it N THE CAMPSITE he SECOND TYRANNOSAUR now steps out of the jungle, joinin he first. Panic hits the camp as the sleeping HUNTERS wak p. Many of them start to run oland scrambles toward his tent, where he can see his weapo ying near the open flap. As he draws close, an enormou -rex foot stomps down on the tent, driving the rifle dee nto the mud oland, weaponless, stands frozen, watching as the panicke unters flee in all directions.
_ROLAND
"FOR CHRIST'S SAKE, DON'T RUN!"
But they ignore him, sweeping him up in the wave of flushe rey that pours across the campsite. Some toss random an ll-aimed GUNSHOTS back at the rexes CROSS THE CAMPSITE ICK bursts out of the crowd, sees Kelly and Sarah strugglin o get out of the sleeping bag, and grabs each by an arm. H ips them to their feet and sweeps them off ahead of him, int he jungle N THE MIDDLE OF THE CROWD ALCOLM, blinking back sleep, stands a good head above th est of the panicking crowd. Frantically, he scans the group.
_MALCOLM
"KELLY? KEEEEELLLY?!"
But he can't see her T THE EDGE OF CAMP he two rexes join forces, herding the fleeing Hunters into  arrow ravine P ON A ROCK RACE oland scrambles up a steep rock face. No way in hell he' oing down that ravine. He sees Malcolm, still in the middl f the camp, start to head for the ravine.
_ROLAND
"MALCOLM! OVER HERE!"
Malcolm runs over and hurls himself at the rock face crambling to climb up the smooth, steep boulders ehind him, one of the rexes spots him and lunges across th amp toward him.
_ROLAND (cont'd)
"FASTER!!"
Malcolm gives it everything he's got, clawing his way up th ock face - - and rex draws closer and pounces at his legs - - and Roland reaches down, grabs Malcolm by the hair an ulls him up, out of the rex's grasp he rex falls short, but he's close enough that we can hea is teeth SNAP together, closing around nothing but air. I urns, sees easier prey in the fleeing Hunters, and takes of fter them alcolm lands on top of the rock ledge with a CRUNCH. Rolan nceremoniously dumps a fistful of hair in his lap N THE RAVINE elly, in the middle of the fleeing crowd with Sarah and Nick ears her father screaming her name and looks up. Malcolm an oland are on the rock ridge above them, keeping pace.
_MALCOLM
(shouting)
"KELLY, UP HERE!"
But Kelly continues to flee, as the rexes are in the ravin ow, and drawing closer to the group ome Hunters try to leap up and scale the rocks, but th avine is deepening, there's no way out. One rex grabs hol f a Hunter in its teeth and hurls him against the rock face he second rex picks up another Hunter and snaps its massiv ead left and right quickly, to break its victim's neck. Th unter goes flying forward and crashes into - - CARTER, Dieter's driver, who stumbles and falls. The res f the fleeing humans run around or over him, but when th ex lifts its foot, we see Carter is actually stuck to th ottom of it - - and when the animal takes its next step it CRUSHES him int he earth P ON TH ROCK FACE alcolm is frantic.
_MALCOLM
"I gotta get down there!"
DOWN IN THE RAVINE t's obvious no one is going to outrun the rexes, and Nic nows it. He bursts ahead of Sarah and Kelly and spot omething off to his left t's a waterfall, apparently right in front of a sheer roc ace. But there's something about the way the water i alling that tells him something.
_NICK
"SARAH KELLY COME HERE!"
He grabs each of them and hauls them forward, running straigh t the waterfall. Apparently, he intends to jump right int he rock, and he's dragging them along with him.
_SARAH
"WHAT ARE YOU-"
_NICK
"JUMP!"
The three of them spring right at the waterfall and disappea HROUGH the water R. BURKE, fleeing along with everyone else, is watching a hey vanish EHIND THE WATERFALL here is a small recess, which is what Nick had hoped for t's small, only four or five feet deep, but it's just enoug or him, Sarah, and Kelly to cover behind the flowing water reathless, terrified, they can hear the mayhem outside.
_NICK
"Shhhh... shhhh..."
With an enormous SPLASH, something bursts through th ascading water and crashes into them r. Burke.
_BURKE
"Get out of the way!"
He pulls his way up against the far wall, as far away from th ater as he can OOOOM! Now another shape bursts through the watery curtain  Tyrannosaur head. Burke gave away the hiding spot he four SCREAM as the rex's jaws SNAP left and right earching for them, falling just inches short. They squeez s far back against the wall as they can get he rex can't quite get its head all the way through th pening - - so it uses its tongue. A long, dark blue shape slither ut of its mouth and touches the humans, trying to wrap aroun hem, to pull them out of the cave urke, blind with panic, forces himself even further into th ave, which pushes Kelly further out.
_SARAH
"STOP IT YOU'RE PUSHED HER OUT STOP IT!"
But Burke doesn't listen, throwing elbows to make room fo imself. His movements dislodge a portion of muddy earth, an  flurry of enormous cockroaches, eight or nine inches lon ach, pour out of the wall and swarm over his face and neck urke SCREAMS and instinctively leaps away, toward the flowin ater nd that's all the leverage the rex needs. It curls it ongue, wrapping Burke up in it and pulling him between it eeth. SCREAMING hideously, he is dragged out, through th aterfall, and disappears arah, Nick, and Kelly stare in horror as the white screen o ater turn pink P ON THE ROCK FACE alcolm and Roland see the rex walk away from the waterfal ith Burke, leaving the hiding place unmolested. Malcolm i early hysterical.
_ROLAND
"She's okay! They'll stay in there, she's okay!"
IN A JUNGLE CLEARING outed Hunters emerge from the gully at the edge of h ungle. Ahead of them, there is a large open plain covered b ong "elephant" grass JAY, running along with them, stops abruptly at the edge o he grass, SHOUTING to the others.
_AWAY
"NO! DON'T GO INTO THE LONG GRASS!"
Not in the frenzy, they ignore him. Behind Ajay, the enormou hadows of the two pursuing tyrannosaurs stop as well, holdin p at the edge of the jungle jay, torn between a sense of responsibility and his bette udgement, opts for the former and races into the grass afte he other Hunters, waving his arms P ABOVE THEM oland and Malcolm come out onto a rocky ledge that has a vie f the plain below. Roland can see the Hunters leaving trail s they plow through the grass.
_ROLAND
"Elephant grass!"
ON THE PLAIN he groups of Hunters wades into the middle of the long grass ne of them stops and turns, looking back at the jungle trees.
_HUNTER
"They gave up! They're not chasing us!"
There are CHEERS, SIGHS OF relief. In the distance, AJAY' OICE can be heard, faintly calling to them to come back. U n the rock in the distance, they can see Roland, waving hi rms madly ut in the giddiness of their escape, they pay it no mind hey continue plowing into the high grass, anything to ge urther away from the tyrannosaurs BOUT FIFTY YARDS AWAY he tops of three animal heads rise up slowly, backlit b he full moon. In the distance, the heads can seethe Hunte arty. The heads descend, back into the grass ACK WITH THE HUNTERS hey continue forward, oblivious. Now behind them, fou ore heads rise up in the grass. As then descend n all sides of the Hunters, the grass ripples as animals mov orward toward them, undetected, inexorable as torpedoes nd these torpedoes are on target. One Hunter is suddenl ragged down, yanked silently below the surface of the tal rass n his place, a long, lizard-like tail rises up as the anima rops its head to make the kill ehind him, two more Hunters are taken down, and two mor nimal tails rise up in their place. A Hunter ahead hears th USTLING and turns. His face turns white as, behind him - - a VELOCIRAPTOR springs out of the grass elociraptor runs upright on its powerfully muscled hind legs he second tow of each foot bearing an extra-large curve law, carried in a retracted position, with which it slashe n attack ike now. This raptor SNARLS and SLAMS into the body of th unter, taking him down. A feeding frenzy ensues. Th unters run in all directions, but are pulled down and vanis nto the twitching long grass nother raptor enters from the right, leaps high into the air ast the full moon, SLAMS into the chest of more human prey nd takes him down, into the grass ehind them, Ajay's face falls, defeated. He looks around ealizing he too is now stranded in the middle of the lon rass round him, four torpedo trails head straight for him jay simply closes his eyes P ON THE ROCK oland turns away from the carnage, pained.
_CUT TO:
EXT. RUINED CAMPSITE - NIGH ARAH, MALCOLM, KELLY, NICK, ROLAND, DR. JUTTSON, and PETE UDLOW stand in the ruins of their campsite, their rank ecimated, spirits shattered oland is at the hole in the ground where his tent once was e has pulled his .800 Nitro Express from the mud and more o ess cleaned it, now he's checking the loads elly, nearly catatonic with fear, clings to Sarah, and i oesn't look as if she'll ever let go. Malcolm, who is on hi nees picking through the wreckage of a tent, looks over a hem, but Sarah waves him off -- "she's okay. oland appears, standing over the group. He looks at Malcolm ho has found the Lindstradt rifle, intact.
_ROLAND
"How many rounds did you find for that weapon?"
_MALCOLM
"Four, counting the one in the chamber."
_ROLAND
"Don't let it out of your hands again."
(to Sara, but looking at
_Kelly)
"Can the kid walk?"
_SARAH
"Ask her."
_ROLAND
"Can the kid walk?"
_KELLY
"I can. I can walk."
While he addresses the group, Roland straps on one of th ervo-lights, the shoulder-mounted flashlights that follo our gaze.
_ROLAND
"We're going to find a path down into the interior of the island. Load up whatever you think you need, and I mean need. If you can't carry it indefinitely, don't bring it. We'll hit the worker village in a couple hours and be out of here before dawn."
AT THE EDGE OF CAMP oland bends over one of the three-toed footprints left by th ex. Behind him, the rest of the group is packing up linging the remnants of their equipment over their shoulders oland bends over and SNIFFS the footprint. It's filled wit  liquid of some kind e takes his canteen, dumps the remaining water into th round, and plunges the canteen into the footprint, fillin t. Ludlow hovers over his shoulder.
_LUDLOW
"What is that?"
_ROLAND
"Piss."
Ludlow doesn't ask OW AT THE FIRE oland stares down at the ashes of the cooking fire that le o such disaster. He grabs a handful of the ash and shoves i n his pants pocket.
_CUT TO:
EXT. VALLEY OF DEATH - NIGH OLAND and LUDLOW (who, along with Sarah and Malcolm, is als earing a servo-light now) maneuver down a rugged hillside an ome out in a flattened area. Ludlow GASPS, looking ahead i onderment. MALCOLM breaks through the hillside's foliage  oment later. He too stares in amazement ARAH and KELLY come next, then NICK, then JUTTSON. One b ne, they all stop and stare.
_SARAH
"God help us."
They're standing in a flat, sandy area lined with boulders a he sides. The flat area stretches fifty yards from side t ide and as far as they can see ahead. But that's not wha mazes them so verywhere, the sand is dotted with dinosaur skeletons. Som re huge, apatosaurs, sixty feet from head to tail tip thers are smaller, herbivores of many different kinds. Th ore intact skeletons lie on their sides, their ribcages arc f pale bone. but just as many have been ripped apart, bit f carcass tossed in every direction.
_NICK
"I do not feel lucky."
_ROLAND
"Keep moving."
They march on, tiny figures moving among the mountainou keletons by the light of the full moon. Roland notices on arcass in particular, a recent kill. It's an enormou ADROSAUR with fresh bites taken out of it e bends down, studying the soft earth around it fo ootprints URTHER ON alcolm looks up, noticing the bony shapes around them, whic all in heavy shadows like cell bars, seem to be changing e turns, and his servo-light shines on the bones. Bu hey're not bones any more at all, they're pipes, the anima raveyard now given over to the lifeless skeletons of manmad bjects -- twisted, rotting machinery.
_LUDLOW
"We made it!"
They hurry over a small rise - XT. WORKER VILLAGE - NIGH - and find themselves at the edge of what was once Isl orna's worker village. The size of a football field, th own is divided by a main street that's dotted on both side y stores, residences, cafes, a gas station. All the way a he far end is a large, blocky, four-story building ut the town is a mess. The hurricane that hit here must hav een ferocious, for everywhere things are smashed, broken pended. And the jungle has stepped into the breath, growin p, around, and over everything. Huge root systems snak hrough the street, making it almost impassable.
_MALCOLM
"The jungle. It's always ready to return."
Roland catches up and looks at Ludlow.
_ROLAND
"Where's the power and radio setup?"
_LUDLOW
"Operations building. Far end of the street."
A light rain falls as they start down the street, carefully ilently, Roland and Malcolm with their weapons at the ready hey pass the skeleton of a fallen water tower. An empty ga tation, its vine-snarled pumps now useless. The only soun s the low mechanical HUM of the servo-lights as they follo he group's gazes obediently very few feet, the group encounters strange, grayish lump hat lies in random places in the middle of the street alcolm, curious, stops and taps one of them. It's a rock-hard ick looks over his shoulder.
_NICK
"Lava?"
_MALCOLM
"No."
_NICK
"What are they?"
_MALCOLM
"I don't know."
Finally, they reach the operation building, at the far end o he town.
_LUDLOW
"The radio rig is inside. It runs directly from the geothermal generator, so power shouldn't be a problem."
_ROLAND
"Good."
He pulls out his canteen. Ludlow watches as he screws the to ff, moves toward the building, and starts splashing th ontents on the outside of it he rest of the group just stares at him.
_MALCOLM
"What's he got in there?"
_LUDLOW
"Piss."
_SARAH
"What?"
_LUDLOW
"Don't ask me. The guy's completely out to lunch."
_NICK
"What in God's name would he want with-"
Roland rejoins them.
_ROLAND
"Tyrannosaur urine. I don't want anything to do with it, and neither does any other animal on this island. This building is now demarcated as the rex's territory. As long as you  stay in that building, you'll all be safe until the helicopter comes."
He drops his pack, swings his gun off his shoulder, and check he load. Dr. Juttson looks fearful.
_JUTTSON
"Where are you going?"
_ROLAND
"After the rex. I saw a fresh kill back in the valley with tyrannosaur tracks all around it. If I'm not back in time, don't wait for me."
_SARAH
"You've got to be kidding."
_ROLAND
"Runs against my nature to hole up in a cave and wait."
_LUDLOW
"Do you think the rex might have the infant with it?"
_ROLAND
"Possible."
Ludlow takes off his hat and turns to Nick.
_LUDLOW
"You know how to work a radio, don't you?"
_SARAH
"You're going too?"
_LUDLOW
"I lost everything I came after on this trip, but one T-rex in one theme park could single-handedly bail InGen out of Chapter"
He takes a slip of paper from the brim of his hat and hands i o Nick.
_LUDLOW (cont'd)
"This is the broadcast frequency. ID yourself as "Harvest Leader." You know what to tell 'em."
_MALCOLM
"You gentlemen feel you have to do this now?"
_ROLAND
"Now's the perfect time. The animal just fed, so it won't stalk us for food. Predators don't hurt when they're not hungry."
Ludlow double checks the clip on his semi-automatic rifle --
_NICK
"No."
-- and SMACKS it back into the belly of the gun.
_NICK (cont'd)
"Only humans do."
_CUT TO:
INT. COMMUNICATIONS ROOM - NIGH he console of a sophisticated radio set-up glows brightly ll green, red, and yellow. NICK tunes the dial to a specifi requency. The radio WHINES and HISSES tuning in.
_NICK
(into microphone)
"CQ, CQ. This is InGen Operation Harvest Leader to Harvest Base. Come in, please."
The remaining SURVIVORS, minus Ludlow and Roland, shine thei lashlights around the dusty, vine-hung interior of th ommunications room. On the wall a row of chrome letters says
"We Make The Future," but the words are obscured by a tangle
of vines. Mushrooms and fungi sprout from the carpet n one wall, there is a mural of what the completed Jurassi ark would have looked like. Big hotels, Ford Explorers wit ourists leaning out the windows taking pictures, big crowd t the fences around the animal exhibits. But none of it cam rue, and now even the mural is runny and dust-covered here is a pause, filed only with radio static. Sarah look t Nick tensely, waiting. Finally, a VOICE comes over th adio, clean as can be.
_VOICE (o.s.)
"Go ahead, Harvest Leader."
They all breath a sign of relief.
_CUT TO:
EXT. MAIN STREET - NIGH ith Roland and Ludlow gone on the hunt and the rest of th roup inside the operations building, main street stand eserted and silent early deserted, anyway. Moonlight shadows lengthen at on nd of the street - - and FIVE VELOCIRAPTORS STROLL INTO TOWN.

EXT. VALLEY OF DEATH - NIGH OLAND AND LUDLOW are back in the valley of death, standin mid the giant skeletons of long-dead animals. Roland bend own, checking the carcass of the freshly-chewed HADROSAUR h aw earlier  set of giant three-toed rex tracks leads away from th arcass, down the stream bed. Roland follows them. Ludlo ollows Roland s they near a bend in the stream, Roland looks down, at th urface of the water. A pattern of ripples moves toward them ashing over their ankles. Roland follows the ripples wit is eyes. From up head, around the bend, he can hear th ound of an animal eating and drinking. A very large animal e reaches into his pocket and pulls out a pinch of the ashe rom the cooking fire that he scooped up earlier and release hat on the wind. They float there for a second, suspended hen blow back at him.
_LUDLOW
"We're downwind. Good."
Roland darts a contemptuous look at him. He puts a finger t is lips, gesturing for silence, then steps up, onto th hore. Ludlow follows hey creep forward, toward the sounds. They round the ben nd Roland hits his belly, edging up over a small rise ver the rise, he sees the TYRANNOSAUR, about a hundred yard head. It's stooped over the stream bed, drinking. Like  ird, it dips its head in the water and then straightens up o let the water fall down its throat. A dozen COMPYS are a he water as well, drinking oland gently FLICKS the safety on his gun to "off. udlow edges toward the cover of a low-hanging branch. As h uts his weight on one knee, it presses down hard on th iddle of a small stick, which CRACKS in half. Roland turns yes blazing ut in the open, the tyrannosaur snaps its head sharply a ell, staring in the direction of the sound. But sinc oland's own head is turned, he doesn't see the dinosaur' eaction. Roland holds a warning finger out to Ludlow oland turns his head back. The tyrannosaur is gone URTHER ON he trail of three-toed tyrannosaur footprints stops abruptly oland stops too, gesturing for Ludlow to freeze behind him oland glances both ways, looking for any sign of the track o the right, the ground gives way to hard black volcanic rock  short distance behind them, the rock is solid, a massive reen, pebbled boulder ten feet high. Roland frowns an HISPERS in Ludlow's ear again.
_ROLAND
"We took to the rock."
_LUDLOW
"Why?"
In front of Roland, a palm frond sways gently in the nigh reeze. Roland's eyes widen. He pulls out another pinch o ampfire ash and releases it on the wind his time, the ash blows off, straight away from him.
_ROLAND
"Wind shift."
They freeze, terrified. Behind them, the enormous gree ebbled boulder - - opens an eye hat's no boulder, that's the MALE TYRANNOSAUR, standin ock-solid still, its natural camouflage blending into th urrounding foliage perfectly. Very slowly and almos ilently, the rex brings its head all the way around until i s staring directly down at them from about ten feet away oland and Ludlow stand frozen, their back to the rex naware of its presence ntil it exhales. The soft SNORT of its breath isn't quit udible, but it brushes the hair on the backs of their neck ver so slightly heir hearts drop into their stomachs. Ludlow speaks, hi oice a queasy HISS.
_LUDLOW
"It's... behind... us."
_ROLAND
(the very softest whisper)
"It's just fed. It won't attack unless it's threatened. Don't move."
As the rex silently cocks its head, sizing up the danger fro hese intruders, it breathes again. A few strands of Ludlow' air flap in the exhalation. He closes his eyes, near tears e can't take it. His eyes dart, glancing down at the weapo e holds in his hands. Unfortunately, it's extended in fron f him, away from the rex e risks another HISS.
_LUDLOW
"If I don't move, I can't shoot it."
_ROLAND
"Let it go, Peter. The animal won."
Behind them, the rex appears satisfied. It starts to swin ts massive head around, back toward the jungle. It lifts on reat leg and takes a step into the trees oland signs and closes his eyes, relieved ut Ludlow seizes the opportunity. He whips his weapon aroun nd drops to one knee.
_ROLAND (cont'd)
"NO!"
The rex is infinitely quicker. Ludlow just has time t queeze off a short burst of semi-automatic gunfire when th nimal whirls, takes one elegant step forward, and POUNCES udlow's bullets rip harmlessly through the foliage betwee he rex's legs as its big head snaps forward and comes down aws wide. They close around Ludlow's body, lift his straigh p into the air, and toss him once, readjusting their grip s t is firmly around his midsection he whole combination of movements takes but half a second y the time Roland turns around, the animal has pivoted an arted back into the jungle, carrying Ludlow, still SCREAMIN nd writhing in its mouth oland raises his gun, to draw a bead on the animal, bu hrough the shivering trees, he can only see that th yrannosaur is gone.

She notices Malcolm, recognize im he nudges a Young Man next to her, about thirteen years old he Young Man turns and breaks into a smile just as welcoming s the ceremony breaks up, they walk over to him.
_MALCOLM
"Hello, Lex. Tim."
LEX stands on her tiptoes and kisses Malcolm on the cheek IM extends a hand and Malcolm shakes it.
_MALCOLM (cont'd)
"This is Kelly. My daughter."
They nod their hellos.
_LEX
"I'm glad you came, Dr. Malcolm"
_MALCOLM
"I'm sorry about your grandfather."
_TIM
"Thank you."
_LEX
"We were going to call you, in a few days. Tim and I have been thinking, and we've decided we want people to know about the island. About what we all saw."
_TIM
"We think it's something our grandfather would want us to do."
_MALCOLM
(pause)
"Why?"
_LEX
"Because it's true."
Malcolm looks at her for a long moment.
_MALCOLM
"I know, Lex. But even if we're the only ones who ever know, it'll still be true. You see, I've decided that if the world found out about what your grandfather created, it wouldn't be around for very long."
_LEX
"But -- it was real. You can't let people go on saying it's not."
_MALCOLM
"That's the thing about reality."
He looks down at Kelly.
_MALCOLM (cont'd)
"Even when people stop believing in it, it doesn't go away."
Kelly smiles and takes his hand, her slender finger nterlocking with his XT. JUNGLE - DA ack on Isla Sorna, we float over the deserted worker village oving lightly, as in a dream.
_MALCOLM (V.O.)
"Do you feel the cold wind blowing on your face? That's real."
We sweep low, landing on the roof the helicopter took of rom, the nest below now careful rebuilt with straw an crap, a dozen unblemished eggs in the middle of it.
_MALCOLM (V.O.)
"Do you see the four of us, standing here together, alive? That's real."
A PTERANODON land gently on the nest. Ever so carefully, i ositions itself over the eggs, lowers itself to roostin osition, and folds its giant wings around its body.
_MALCOLM (V.O.)
"And maybe that's still that matters."
The animal raises its head, opens its beak, and SQUAWK pprovingly up at the heavens.
_FADE OUT
