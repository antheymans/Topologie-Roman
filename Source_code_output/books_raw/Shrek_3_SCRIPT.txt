Prince Charming gets in Pinocchio's face.
_PRINCE CHARMING
"You're telling me you don't know where Shrek is?"
Pinocchio is still a little nervous.
_PINOCCHIO
"It wouldn't be inaccurate to assume that I couldn't exactly not say that is or isn't almost partially incorrect."
Pinocchio thinks he has the upper hand.
_PRINCE CHARMING
"So you do know where he is!"
_PINOCCHIO
"On the contrary, I'm possibly more or less, not definitely rejecting the idea, that in no way, with any amount of uncertainty that..."

_SHREK
"Oh no, in fact, the King asked for you personally."
Artie smiles.
_ARTIE
"Really? Wow! Look, I know it's not all gonna be fun and games."
_SHREK
"It really is all fun and games, actually. Sure, you have to knight a few heroes, launch a ship or two. By the way, make sure you hit the boat just right with the bottle."
_ARTIE
"Boat with the bottle? Any idiot can hit a boat with a bottle."
Shrek chuckles sheepishly.
_SHREK

_SHREK
"Or too salty!"
Shrek turns to Puss and Donkey, trying to shut them up.
_DONKEY
(TO ARTIE)
"Don't worry about it. You'll be safe and sound with the help of your body guards."
_ARTIE
"Body guards?"
_PUSS
"All of them, willing at a moment's notice to lay down their own lives out of devotion to you."
_ARTIE
"Really?"
_PUSS
"Si, and the whole kingdom will look to you for wisdom and guidance."
Behind Artie, Shrek mouths "shut-up" to Puss and Donkey.

_SHREK
"We don't want Artie here getting the wrong idea."

"But I don't know anything about being King!"
_SHREK
"You'll learn on the job!"
Donkey and Puss roll across the deck.
_DONKEY
"Whoaaa!"
Shrek grabs the wheel and swings it around. Artie yanks th heel. They wrestle for control.
_ARTIE
"Sorry to disappoint you, but I'm going back!"
_SHREK
"Back to what? Being a loser?!"
As soon as the word leaves his lips, Shrek knows he's gon oo far. Stung, Artie lets go of the wheel, leaving Shrek t ank hard on it. He pulls the steering column from th ecking.
_SHREK (CONT'D)
"Now look what you did!"
_ARTIE
"Look what I did? Who's holding the wheel chief?"

_SHREK
"Hey, if you think this is getting you out of anything, well it isn't. We're heading back to Far Far Away one way or another, and you're gonna be a father!"
Artie raises an eyebrow. Puss and Donkey stare at Shre ncomfortably.
_ARTIE
"What?"
_DONKEY
(clearing his throat)
"A-hem. You just said father..."
_SHREK
"You're... I said king. You're gonna be King!"

_SHREK
"You get back here young man and I mean it!"
Artie keeps climbing.
_PUSS
"Uh boss, I don't think he's coming back and maybe it's for the best. He is not exactly king material."
Shrek looks towards Artie.
_DONKEY
"When were you planning on telling him that you were really supposed to be King?"
_SHREK
"Oh c'mon, now why would I do that? Besides, he'll be ten times better at it than me."
Shrek starts off after Artie. Donkey jumps in front of Shrek.

"If you think this whole mad scene ain't dope, I feel you dude. I mean, I'm not trying to get up in your grill or raise your roof or whatever, but what I am screaming is, yo, check out this kazing thazing bazaby."
Puss and Donkey glance at each other. Artie notices  ottage in the distance and heads toward it.
_SHREK
"I mean, if it doesn't groove or what I'm saying ain't straight trippin', just say, oh no you didn't, you know, you're gettin' on my last nerve. And then I'll know it's... then I'll know it's whack--"

"Oh, is that some kind of crack about ogres? You get your royal highness to Far Far Away before I kick it there."
(TO MERLIN)
"Now which way am I kicking?"
_MERLIN
"Oh, I could tell you. But since you're in the midst of self- destructive rage spiral it would be karmic-ly irresponsible."
_SHREK
"Self-destructive ra..."
(TO MERLIN)
"Look, are you gonna help us or not? Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script"
_MERLIN
"Most definitely, but only after you take the journey to your soul."

"Well, I doubt he was worse than mine."
_SHREK
"Oh yeah? My father was an ogre. He tried to eat me."
Artie looks at Shrek.
_SHREK
"Now, I guess I should have seen it coming. He used to give me a bath in barbecue sauce and put me to bed with an apple in my mouth."
Artie chuckles at this.
_ARTIE
"Okay... I guess that's... pretty bad."
Artie laughs and then pokes at the fire.
_SHREK
"You know, it may be hard to believe what with my obvious charm and good looks, but people used to think that I was a monster. And for a long time, I believed them."
Artie looks up at Shrek.
_SHREK (CONT'D)
"But after awhile, you learn to ignore the names that people call you and you just trust who you are."
Artie gently pokes at the embers with a stick for a moment.
_ARTIE
"You know, you're okay, Shrek."
He tosses the stick into the fire.
_ARTIE
"You just need to do a little less yelling and use a little more soap. Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script"
