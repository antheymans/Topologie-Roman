_BROTHER KYLE
"Well would he guess the ascending of the star, Wherein his patient's fortunes settled were. He knew the course of every malady, Were it of cold or heat or moist or dry. Brother John, would-be Doctour of Physick."

_BROTHER KYLE
"Tend you quickly he will, with bottles from a shelf. But heals not, so easily, The ills which plague himself."
Brother John stops stirring.
_BROTHER JOHN
(to Kyle)
"Enough."
He scoops the salve out with his fingers and applies it to th urned Monk's arm. The Burned Monk INHALES sharpley as the coo ixture contacts the injured area. 
_BROTHER JOHN
(to the burned Monk)
"Relax."
(to Kyle)
"Put those lungs of yours to better use."
_BROTHER KYLE
"Yes, Doc Tor."
Kyle laughs, removes the blowing iron from the molten glass -  BLOB of white hot glass hanging on the end e rolls the blob on the Marver, a flat, polished piece of ron, then begins to blow a bottle shaped container. ohn wraps a fray-edged cloth bandage around the burn.
_JOHN
"Keep this from getting wet. Go home at late afternoon mealtime and don't come back to work today --"
_BURNED MONK
"But John --"
_JOHN
"I'll tell the Abbot. Just rest today. You're lucky you only burned yourself on the side of the furnace. If some of that glass had gotten on your arm --"
He points to the top of his forearm.
_JOHN
"-- it would've burned clean through to the other side."
He mimes a drop down from the bottom of his arm he Burned Monk shudders at the thought. ELLS toll.

_JOHN
"That's late afternoon. Now get on."
_BURNED MONK
"Thank you, John. I --"
_JOHN
"You're welcome. Go!"
The Burned Monk trundles off, injured arm against his chest ohn gathers his mortar, pestle, and extra bandages into  urlap sack. Kyle comes over.
_KYLE
"Good work."
_JOHN
"All right, but I'm no Father Anselm."
_KYLE
"You're yourself, that's better..."
Kyle pushes him through the door.. NTO THE HALLWA he Hallway is alive with cassocked monks heir LOW CHANTING reverberates throughout the building he wooden floorboards creak beneath their combined weights his is obviously a MEDIEVAL MONASTERY...
_KYLE
"The Abbot will be pleased."
_JOHN
"Don't."
_KYLE
"Don't what?"
_JOHN
"Please don't tell him. At least until I know if there's an infection."
_KYLE
"You want to be the Abbey's Physician, and you haven't learned the first rule: Don't worry about the patient."
John's face drops.
_KYLE
"I shouldn't have. Sorry. Look, I know how you must --"
_JOHN
"You don't, but thanks anyway."
AT THE END OF THE HALLWA  wide stairwell. A constant stream of monks all moving dow he stairs. Coming from floors above. Headed for lunch yle starts down. John starts up --
_KYLE
"Not coming down?"
_JOHN
"I have someone waiting for me."
Kyle disappears into the crowd ohn moves up.. HE STAIRWA  river of brown cassocks running downstream ohn is the only one moving against the flow e exits the stairwell - NE FLOOR U  narrow corridor lined with doorways ohn moves to one in particular e doesn't even look as he grabs the door knob his is his room e opens the door - N BROTHER JOHN'S ROO n old, worn out DOG lays in wait on an old, worn out cassoc hich is now serving as its bed t the sight of John it stands.

"Come on, Mattias."
The dog, MATTIAS, joins him in the hall onk and pet disappear up a flight of stairs. ast another dozen or so Monks who are on their way down NT.

He watches the few stragglers retur heir chain bound volumes to the shelves and head for the door hen rises and joins them.. N THE CORRIDOR JUST OUTSIDE THE LIBRAR ohn leans against the wall as Philip exits attias is nowhere to be seen. 
_PHILIP
"Brother John."
_JOHN
"Brother Philip."
_PHILIP
"Feeding the mind instead of the body again?"
_JOHN
"My training has taught me to feed what's hungry."
Philip pats his broad stomach and heads down the hallway.
_PHILIP
"As did mine. As long as you're alone. Enjoy yourself -- and remember, no book leaves the library."
_JOHN
"How could I forget? Have a good meal..."
John watches the corpulent librarian head down the stairs hen he's gone from sight John lifts the bottom of his cassoc o reveal Mattias.
_JOHN
"Perfect."
They move into the library.. HE MEDIEVAL SECTIO he oldest books ohn moves to the stacks attias trots over to a particular bench and sits his is his regular place T THE SHELVE ohn stands on toe tips to retrieve an ancient Tome e runs his fingers over the familiar leather binding  smile plays across his lips e carries the book, places it on the edge of the table s here is slack in the chain its on the bench next to the dog lears his throat, opens the book, begins to read...
_John
(reading)
"In the year of our Lord"
I, Brothe Gerhado of the Minorite Abbey helped bury the Abbot and my sixty fellow monks --"
_VOICE O/S
"Sometimes, I think you'd like that."
John turns to find - HE ABBO eader of the monastery. In his seventies but looks younger is Cassock is adorned with a large, ornately carved, woode HAIN in place of a rope belt. He crosses to the table ohn closes the book and stands, head bowed in respect.
_John
"Abbot, I -- I didn't think anyone would --"
_ABBOT
"Mind? Just Philip, if he knew. I passed him on the way up. He said you'd come  in alone. I knew better."
He scratches the back of Mattias' neck.
_ABBOT
"Hello, Mattias. How are you, boy?"
The dog snuffles in response.
_ABBOT
"You know what Philip says about Mattias' hair and his breathing. You'll have to  take him out of here."
_JOHN
"He likes when I read to him and -- I  can't --"
John looks down sheepishly. Though nearly forty, he feel lmost adolescent in the presence of the Abbot. he Abbot pulls a large key from his pocket.
_ABBOT
(smiles)
"Someone must have left this one unlocked. Take the book with you."
He hands the key to John, who is shocked - his is a great honor.
_JOHN
"Father, I --?"
_ABBOT
"Kyle tells me you did a good job at the glassworks today."
_JOHN
"I'll reserve judgement until the patient lives."
John crosses to the shelf and unlocks his book e returns the key.
_ABBOT
"It will get easier. Father Anselm was... an unexpected loss. You'll do fine."
The Abbot walks towards the door...
_ABBOT
"Just have it back before the end of lunch. Oh -- And I didn't see you in here."
_JOHN
"Thank you."
(to Mattias)
"Let's go upstairs, boy."

Mattias lifts his ears at this part. His favorite part.
_JOHN
"- fled. I have put this to parchment lest this pestilence - this Black Death -  stay my hand."

"John! Wait -- ! Don't go in!"
John turns back to the open hatch achine recirculated air flows out e feels it on the skin of his face. Cool ool, and artificial. It calls to him e steps in. Swallowed by the blackness - HOOSH-CLANG - he door closes behind him NT. SULACO ESCAPE POD #4 - DA ark. Dim red lights. John stands still as his eyes adjust t he darkness.

A Small RED LIGHT pulses at th ead of the tube -- a soft VOICE and TONE, like your seat bel arning -- is audible...

"John - what is it? Is this a Supply ship?"
_JOHN
"No. No supplies. Kyle, there's someone in here --"
The Second Monk looks at Kyle.
_SECOND MONK
"This is forbidden."
_KYLE
"John. Just get the hell out of there --"
_JOHN
"I don't want to stay. I have to get her out before this sinks. You come in, give me a hand --"

_KYLE
"You shouldn't have gone in --"
_JOHN
"I'm supposed to be a doctor."
He pushes Ripley's hair away from her forehead.
_JOHN
"She could've been lost."
_FIRST MONK
"Been a long time since I saw either."
_SECOND MONK
"It isn't sinking. Look at it. What are we supposed to do with it?"
_KYLE

"Thousands of lights. Like the stars. Like Heaven on Earth."
Ripley stirs in John's arms. Groans ights to come out of her fugue state.. ooks around through half-lidded eyes - he is surrounded by rowing, cassocked Monks ONKS? She closes her eyes ries to clear the imagine.

She looks over at John, sleepin eacefully. He doesn't notice the Alien - he Alien moves closer. he can feel his breath -- it evaporates the sweat on he orehead -- a CHILL runs through her but she still can't move - he Alien stands alongside her bed xtends a six-fingered hand.. ently rests it on her stomach ocks its head -- like it's listening to something he implication is clear ipley finds her voice --
_RIPLEY
"AAAAAAAAAAAARGH!"
Her eyes open wide - he sits bolt upright  hand moves to her forehead. Gently pushes her head back t he pillow. John's.
_JOHN
"You're out of it. Out of it..."
Ripley falls back, eyes glued to where the alien appeared ohn sees her focal point, looks back over his shoulder othing ipley's eyes roll back into her head he tries to speak -- It was there er hand, at her side, tightens into a fist - ohn's hand covers hers ases the fingers open again he feels the coarse bandages against her palm e starts to read quietly from Saint Augustines' Confessions he begins to drowse again as his soft voice flows over he ike waves lapping against the shore.. XT. SURGACE OF ARCEON - DA  HOWLING DUST STORM has kicked up. The monks wear small roun oggles, have rags tied over their noses, as they work at a uge BLOCK AND TACKLE arrangement - undreds of ropes grow TAUT imbers GROAN hey LIFT Ripley's SHIP -- SWING it over to a large portal - NT. RIPLEY'S ROOM - DA ipley lays with eyes closed uffled VOICES outside her door:
_ABBOT
"How is the woman, John?"
_JOHN
"I don't think she's here yet."
At the sound of John's voice the SLIGHTEST smile plays cross Ripley's sleeping lips.
_JOHN
"She is close, though."
As they continue talking, Ripley wakes. Opens her eyes olls over onto her side - here is a window right next to the bed ipley lifts herself up on one elbow, looks out ER PO arden of Earthly delights.. onks laboring under a beautiful, celestial blue sky - icking apples, fishing on the water on small inland lakes orking with hammer and saw on small wooden cottages.

_RIPLEY
"What the hell --?"
SUDDENLY - he Sulaco Escape ship APPEARS in front of her WINGS past her window suspended by ropes hen disappears up, out of sight ipley checks her pulse.
_RIPLEY
"This must be a dream. A bad one."
She rolls back onto the bed tares up at the ceiling BOVE HER - ON THE ROOF OF THE ABBE onks scurry around the Ship as it is lowered into place o  flat area of the roof above the libaray t seats with a deeply resounding THUD.. IPLE ears the SOUND and then another - her door OPENING he turns to find the Abbot and John standing in the doorway ohn waits in the doorway as the Abbot crosses to the chair b he bed and sits.
_RIPLEY
"Who are you?"
_ABBOT
"I am the Abbot. Leader of this Colony. And you?"
He smiles. Open. Friendly.
_RIPLEY
"Ripley. How did I get here?"
_ABBOT
"Your vehicle crash landed."
(indicates John)
"Brother John found you and brought you here."
_RIPLEY
"Where is here?"
_ABBOT
"This is the Minorite Abbey within the manmade orbiter Arceon."
_RIPLEY
"Can I use a radio to --"
 
_ABBOT
"We have no radio here. We are a monastic order that has renounced all modern technology. We live the old way. The pure way."
She shakes her head.
_RIPLEY
"Uh, I - I still don't feel 100%. Whoever took me out of the stasis tube must not  have run the full D-F program... Where's Newt?"
The Abbot looks at her blankly.
_RIPLEY
"There was a little girl with me --"
_ABBOT
"You were alone."
_RIPLEY
"No. She was with me. I put her in her stasis tube -- We launched when the --"
_ABBOT
"You were the only living thing found aboard that vessel."
The Abbot watches Ripley as the terrible truth overcomes her --
_RIPLEY
(slowly)
"Oh, God. Newt."
She stops -- gets that chill up her spine - he realizes that she MUST have brought the Alien with her.
_RIPLEY 
"It came with us."
The Abbot leans in.
_ABBOT
"What came with you?"
_RIPLEY
"Listen -- there is a danger here. It came with me. How long have I been here?"
_ABBOT
"Almost two days --"
_RIPLEY
(calculates)
"Loose for two days. This planet could be overrun within the week."
Ripley grabs the Abbot by his cassock --
_RIPLEY
"Look, there's a xenomorph --"
(sees his confusion)
"An Alien creature. A killer. A monster. And now it's here."
The Abbot looks at her the way you look at that guy on the corne f Santa Monica and 3rd who's babbling about Judgement Day. Th uy with his pants down around his kness he sees this, releases her hold on him...
 
_RIPLEY
"Calm down, Ripley. Okay, I was with a platoon of Colonial Marines on a mission to planetoid LV426. We left Earth six months ago - maybe a year --"
_ABBOT
(interrupts)
"Wait a moment --"
The Abbot becomes aware of John's presence in the doorway urns over his shoulder at him.
_ABBOT
"Leave us."
John waits there a beat, then backs out and closes the door.
_ABBOT
"Continue."
_RIPLEY
"We launched in the Cruiser Sulaco from  Gateway sub-orbital space station --"
_ABBOT
"Not possible."
_RIPLEY
"What do you mean?"
_ABBOT
"When we left Earth seventy years ago, it was on the brink of a New Dark Age. Technology was on the verge of destroying the planet's environment. A computer virus was threatening to wipe away all recorded knowledge. There didn't seem to be any way it could be averted. In the almost forty years since we were towed out here in hypersleep, the news that came with  occasional supply ships only got worse. Finally, the ships stopped coming. We  had to resign ourselves to the fact that worst had come to pass, and the Earth no longer existed."
Now she gives him that look.
 
_RIPLEY
(slowly)
"Uh...All right... Forget the Earth - How many people do you have here? Let's worry about them. Warn them --"
A new look overtakes the Abbot's face. A look of fear. ow she's getting to him - or is she e abruptly stands. 
_ABBOT
"Your mind is troubled. You need to rest some more."
_RIPLEY
"I don't need rest - I need to get to  your people. You've got to get to them -- tell them about the alien --"
He heads for the door --
_ABBOT
"I have had enough for now."
_RIPLEY
"Enough? Didn't you hear what I said? It could wipe out the entire population of this planet. It may have started  already - Have there been any unusual  deaths since I got here?"
The Abbot stops in the door -
_ABBOT
"No. And there won't be."
The Abbot SLAMS the door behind him HE CORRIDOR OUTSIDE RIPLEY'S ROOM - DA ohn stands nearby as the Abbot addresses two BURLY MONKS
_ABBOT
"Bolt it."
The guards move to bolt the door.
_JOHN
"What is it -- What's wrong?"
_ABBOT
"Your patient is in a dangerous mental state. Nobody gets in or out until I say so."
_JOHN
"But I. Her meals --"
_ABBOT
"Nobody."
_JOHN
"Father, I don't understand --"
The Abbot turns and disappears down the hall ohn looks from the departing Abbot to the two Guard/Monks HE LIBRARY - NIGH ohn has his head buried in his hands. His back rises and fall ith the rhythmic breathing of sleep attias curled up on his feet. Asleep as well HAM he Library door FLIES open -- ohn sits bolt upright --  HYSTERICAL MONK bursts in ushes to John's table.
_HYSTERICAL MONK
"Brother John! You're here! The Abbot said you'd -- I need -- you're the medic --"
_JOHN
"What?!"
_HYSTERICAL MONK
"My Sandy -- she's ill --"
John tries to rub the fitfull sleep out of his eyes.
_JOHN
"Huh? A woman?"
_HYSTERICAL MONK
"Sandy. My ewe."
John returns his head to the table.
_JOHN
"One of your sheep? Jesus Christ. Call a vet."
_HYSTERICAL MONK
"Father Anselm was the vet."
John looks under his arms at Mattias - he dog just stares at him.
_JOHN
"You're no help. Okay, let me get my bag. All creatures great and small..."
INT. HYSTERICAL MONK'S BARN - NIGH  small structure housing a handful of sheep and a few chicken n wire cages. The wooden walss are full of gaps where board ave been ripped off he Hysterical Monk holds a torch to illuminate the scene. One o is sheep is laying on its side...
_HYSTERICAL MONK
"I just gave her dinner and she keeled over."
_JOHN
"So would I. It's freezing in here."
_HYSTERICAL MONK
"Been using the wood from the walls for the fire in my cabin."

"Haven't we all..."
John kneels at the ewe he's breathing heavy. Rapidly ohn puts his left hand down on the hay covered floor while h hecks the animal's neck pulse with his right hand. he gives a weak "Baa-ah."
_JOHN
"May be pneumonia. Pitch some of that hay around her. Stop this damn cold breeze."
The Hysterical Monk props the torch up in an empty bucket an etreives a crude iron pitchfork from the wall tarts to pile hay around the fallen animal.
_JOHN
"First, I'll --"
He sits up to reach for his back, then stops when he sees what' n his left hand -  SLIMY MUCOUS-LIKE SUBSTANCE
_JOHN
"Wait a minute..."
The Hysterical Monk stops on mid-pitch ohn rubs the material between his fingers rings it close to his nose. Sniffs.
_HYSTERICAL MONK
"What is it?"
_JOHN
"I don't know. It's all over the ground. Some sort of --"
BAAA-AAAH!! he ewe starts to SHAKE - QUIVER - ohn tries to hold it down - he Hysterical Monk, at this juncture, goes completely apeshit.

"An evil has come to Arceon..."
IN THE TRIBUNAL ROOM - NIGH s he continues we move down a row of stern Monk faces, endin t the Abbots...
_ABBOT
"You heard Brother Graham tell of the devil inside sheep's wool --"
He motions towards the Hysterical Monk, sitting in the crowd.
_ABBOT
"An evil brought by this woman in her vessel of technology."
PULL BACK TO REVEA  large circular room with wooden walls stretching thirty fee igh. Light creeps in through stained glass windows undreds of monks sits in a gallery that looms ove he floor of the Tribunal. On the floor he Abbot and the five eldest Monks sit at a long table facin he witness stand. On the stand IPLE onsiders the faces that surround her. Fear. Hate.
_RIPLEY
"This can't be happening."
_BALD TRIBUNAL MONK
"You have no voice in this tribunal."
_RIPLEY
"You must listen to me! You're all in terrible danger! It came with me on the ship --"
_ABBOT
"We know that. At first we believed its arrival was a good omen. But it has only brought pestilence. Dead sheep. Dead fish."
_BALD TRIBUNAL MONK
"Evil."
Ripley turns to the Abbot.
_RIPLEY
"Yes, the ship brought it. Not evil. It brought the Alien. I told you, it's here."
_ABBOT
"We know the name of the evil it brought. It brought technology. Technology to destroy our planet, as surely as it destroyed the Earth."
_MONK IN AUDIENCE
"Destruction!"
_RIPLEY
"I was on the Earth less than a year ago. It's still there. People, cities, all  still there!"
A murmur through the crowd. Some are listening to her he Abbot looks around. He must be in command.
_ABBOT
(matter of fact)
"All dead."
_RIPLEY
(screams)
"It's still there!"
The Abbot smiles to himself for making her crack e stands and begins to pace.
_ABBOT
"You could not have been on the Earth a year ago, because there is no Earth to be on -- for at least twenty years."
_RIPLEY
"I haven't been floating in space for twenty years. Let me get to my ship and I'll prove it."
_BALD TRIBUNAL MONK
"No. Who knows what new evils she'll release if allowed back into that infernal machine."
_MONK IN AUDIENCE
"No! Don't let her!!"
_TRIBUNAL MEMBER
"This woman is a danger. She denies The New Dark Age. She denies reality."
_RIPLEY
"This is reality. There is a Xenomorph loose on this planetoid - a alien -- it must have stowed away on my ship -- must have killed --"
(swallows hard)
"Newt. Killed the girl I brought with me. You can't stop it. It goes inside you like an egg - grows -"
(mimes)
"Explodes out of you - keeps growing into some sort of monster. Kills you -- Kills all of you..."
She looks at the Medieval people around her hey stare at her in complete confusion o them, she does sound like a madwoman.
_RIPLEY
"Who are you people? Look at you -- all of you -- the way you're dressed. This isn't the Middle Ages. You're in space -- on a artifical planet. What are you doing out here?"
There, in the upper tier -- John. They make eye contact. he looks to him pleadingly.
_RIPLEY
"Isn't there anyone here who will listen?"
John looks from Ripley to the Abbot he Abbot stares him down ohn turns away.
_RIPLEY
(defeated)
"I guess not. I can't believe this..."
The gavel BANGS he Abbot sits in a moment of contemplation.
_ABBOT
"Then there is no choice."
The Four Monks grab Ripley roughly - ind her arms.
_ABBOT
(to Ripley)
"The evil is inside you. I cast you down. To be sealed away. And God have mercy on your soul."
_SLAM CUT TO:
THE SHAFT ROOM - DA  Medieval elevator shaft. The "elevator" is a wooden cag owered on thick, rough hewn ropes ipley, bound, is led to it he looks back at the monks who have gathered at the door --
_RIPLEY
"You won't be able to fight it... You don't know what it is --!"
She's put into the cage. The door is secured wo monks begins to pull the ropes. The cage is lifted out ove he abyss -- a vast cavernesque space he other Monks move closer. Crowd around the edge - ohn pushes through them - right to the edge - atches as the cage is slowly lowered down.. ipley looks directly at John --
_RIPLEY
"You've sentenced yourselves to  death!"
John watches as she disappears down into the darkness.. hen turns and pushes his way through the crowd - own the hall - HE TRIBUNAL ROO mpty now except for the Abbot and the Tribunal Members hey speak in hushed tones ohn appears in the doorway, but pauses  trains to hear what they are saying:
_BALD TRIBUNAL MONK
 ...they'll have started before she gets
"down to the Hermitage level."
_ABBOT
"No trouble?"
_BALD TRIBUNAL MONK
"Only finding the wood for the ship. But Anderson's hut was about that big, and he's dead three months now."
_ABBOT
"I had that wood earmaked for the Cloister  next winter. Well, we might not get to the winter if we don't take care of this. By winter time we can start taking the  penitent cells apart. No one in them."
_ANOTHER TRIBUNAL MONK
"The wood isn't going to last forever."
_ABBOT
"Neither are we --"
He becomes aware of John's presence, and motions the othe ribunal members out of the room. John moves to the Abbot he Abbot knows what's coming...
_ABBOT
"Go ahead."
_JOHN
"This woman. Ripley. I tended her --"
_ABBOT
"Yes, and you did a good job. You shouldn't feel responsible. You couldn't have known --"
_JOHN
"Please, sir, let me finish. I feel that there may be something to what she says."
_ABBOT
"There isn't."
The Abbot moves to his table, begins to gather up his gavel otebook. John follows him --
_JOHN
"I don't understand what you are doing."
_ABBOT
"This colony is my responsibility. I am protecting the colony."
_JOHN
"From what? This woman? You never gave her a chance. How can you be so sure you're right?"
_ABBOT
"A better question is what makes you think I'm wrong?"
_JOHN
"You didn't see this thing -- this demon -- Brother Graham and I -- we both saw it."
_ABBOT
(realizes)
"That's right. You both did."
(beat)
"And what was it?"
_JOHN
"I -- I don't know what it was. But I don't think Ripley was a party to it."
_ABBOT
"She admits she brought it."
_JOHN
"But she tried to warn us --"
_ABBOT
"You know that's how the devil works. Deception."
_JOHN
"But I believe her. I don't know how to describe it -- A feeling."
_ABBOT
"You haven't seen a woman in thirty years. Where does this feeling originate, John?"
_JOHN
(points to his head)
"Here."
Pause.
_ABBOT
"I believe you. But your feelings are fooling you. "
_JOHN
"It's - It's her conviction. I just think --"
The Abbot snaps at him --
_ABBOT
"Don't think."
John takes a step back at the Abbot's tone. A tone he's neve eard before. The Abbot runs a hand through his thinning hair orces a smile.
_ABBOT
"It's been a long night. For all of us. You really don't understand what you're dealing with here."
_JOHN
"That's what she said."
The Abbot chafes.
_ABBOT
"These are ideas which threaten the very system we live under. The creature is dead and the woman is gone. Forget them. Both. Go read. Go fishing. Go anywhere, but leave this alone."
_JOHN
"But I --"
_ABBOT
"Alone. I'll get Philip to let Mattias into the Library, all right? For your own good, just stay out of this."
John looks like he's going to protest.
_ABBOT
"I mean it."
_JOHN
(slowly)
"Yes, Father."
John turns and leaves the room. he Abbot stares after him NT. PRISON LEVEL - NIGH ark. Dank. Dreary  NAIL is hammered into a board. Then another he board is old, twisted.

The "widest" part of her cell, the middle, allows her to slid own into a sitting position. She does.
_RIPLEY
"Christ. Jesus Christ. It's here. Here. Shit. Here. I can't get rid of it..."
Looks at the Doll's head --
_RIPLEY
"Newt. This isn't what I wanted..."
She throws the doll's head away - t bounces off the wall and rolls back to an upright positio o that it is staring at her.

"Now find John and have him brought to  me immediately."
_THIRD BURLY MONK
"Yes, Father."
_ABBOT
"Start in the library. And keep it quiet. "

John tries to catch his breath. He gestulates wildly yle puts down his blowing iron.

INT. RIPLEY'S CELL - NIGH arkness. Somewhere water drips into a puddle ipley lays on her side on the floor with her head restin ear the hole in the floor. Her eyes are closed.
_RIPLEY
"Wherever I go."
A HAND pushes a crust of bread through the hole. he opens her eyes to look at the food. The White-Haired Man' ead appears --
_WHITE-HAIRED MAN
"Take it."
_RIPLEY
"Thanks, but no thanks, Anthony."
She knows his name.
_ANTHONY
"You waiting for meat? They don't bring me meat because they know I'm an android. Really don't need it. Bread's better for you anyway. Harder to digest, so  it makes you feel fuller than you are."
_RIPLEY
"Not hungry."
Anthony takes a bite.
_ANTHONY
"Mmmm. Just a little crunchy."
Ripley twists onto her back until she's staring up at th eiling.
_RIPLEY
"Waste of time."
_ANTHONY
"You don't eat, you'll starve to death, girl."
_RIPLEY
"That was the plan when they put me down here. And why should you care?"
_ANTHONY
"Because I'm a synthetic person you don't think I can care?"
_RIPLEY
"Believe me, that's a discussion you don't want to have with me."
_ANTHONY
"You told me you had a bad experience and a good one with androids --"
_RIPLEY
"That's one of each. That means you could go either way. I'm tired of talking about this."
He pushes the bread towards her again.
_ANTHONY
"You've still gotta eat. You gotta fight the bastards --"
_RIPLEY
"I'm tired of fighting. Maybe I'll be dead before he finds me. Maybe he won't get the satisfaction."
_ANTHONY
"He? You make it sound like this Alien has a personal score to settle with you. The biology you describe: Queen laying eggs, larvae, drone -- that's very insectoid. Insects usually don't bear grudges."
_RIPLEY
"And Androids usually aren't the prisoners of lunatics that believe they're ancient  Greeks."
_ANTHONY
"Medieval Monks."
_RIPLEY
"Whatever. "
_ANTHONY
"And they've only chose to live the life style, they don't believe they're --"

Ripley strains to listen. In the distance NOCKING. Someone is knocking on the walls  VOICE calls out - NT. PRISON LEVEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

"Ripley!"
He moves down the hallway ANGS his fist against the walls every few feet - aits a moment for a reply, then moves on NT. ANTHONY'S CEL nthony gets off the floor - Moves so she can see into his cell he walls of Anthony's cell are covered with charcoal sketches  ifferent versions of demons and the devil.

PRISON LEVEL CORRIDOR HALLWAY - ANTHONY PO ohn coming towards him, knocking on the doors of boarded up cells.

"Hey -- you knocking -- cut it out -- You're going to wake everybody up."
John moves to Anthony's door. Looks at him through the slot nthony recognizes him.
_ANTHONY
"Brother John?"
John unbolts Anthony's door icks him up by his cassock --
_JOHN
"Anthony? Thought you dead fifteen years."
_ANTHONY
"Made too good for that. What're you doing?"
_JOHN
"I -- I'm looking -- the Abbot --"
_ANTHONY
"What? You look like you've seen the devil."
_RIPLEY O/S
"He has."
Anthony turns to look back at Ripley -- moves aside so John can ee her face at the hole --
_ANTHONY 
"You mean he --"
Anthony turns back - John is gone NT. THE CORRIDO s John begins to PULL the outermosk planks off.
_RIPLEY
"I was right, wasn't I? You've seen it, you've seen the Alien?"
John pauses at that. is eyes tighten at the memory.
_RIPLEY
"I can tell you have. I was right. It came with me."
(to the wall, sharp)
"Go away."
John stops. Looks at the wall ipley's voice comes clearly through the wood...
_RIPLEY
"Listen, priest, or whatever you are, I know what you want. I can't help you. I couldn't help any of the others.  Just stop what you're doing. Go away. Do you understand?"
John has opened a crack that exposes Ripley's eyes. e stares at her a beat, tries to think of what to reply - e goes back to work as she continues her confession...
_RIPLEY
"You going to stay, Father? But you're  not going to talk. Okay. Then you can listen. You should listen. Your Abbot was right. I am guilty. But not of  heresy. Of murder."
John stops again ust stares at her eyes.
_RIPLEY
"The murder of the crew of the Nostromo. That was when I first met the Alien."
That reminds him of why he's here e doubles his efforts at the boards...
_RIPLEY
"No, not the same one that's here now. Or maybe it is. Maybe they're all the  same one. I couldn't save my crew then. I should have been able to. But I couldn't. When I went the second time --"
Her eyes soften.
_RIPLEY
"Then I met Newt. Newt. I fought -- stayed alive to keep Newt alive. Hoped maybe that would make up for..."
She trails off. Slides down the wall.
_RIPLEY
"Now he got her too. What's the point?"
(hard again)
"Just go away. Leave me in here. If you let me out you'll want me to help you and it will start all over again. Let it end."
John breaks through, flickering torch light streams in the mot illed air around him. Ripley looks up at him.
_RIPLEY
"I can't help you."
John, heaving and panting from the excertion wallows...
_JOHN
"Puh. (pant) Please."
_RIPLEY
"It never ends."
INT. CORRIDOR - PRISON LEVEL - NIGH  long, twisted-plank-floored corridor with a torch every wenty feet. There is MOVEMENT at the far end. Something i oming towards us - FLICKERING in and out of the light and hadow --

"Sheep?"
RIPLEY, JOHN AND ANTHON unning together. Anthony carries a long wooden staff like a pear. John has his bag. Ripley a torch. e move with them.
_ANTHONY
"It must be able to take on some of the characteristics of the animal it grows in. Maybe they are from some sort of aggressive soldier race -- warring parties drop the eggs on opposing planets --"
_RIPLEY
"And the alien takes on the form of the creature that finds it, assuming that animal is the dominant life form on the planet. So when it gestates in a man --"
Ripley shudders at the memory.
_ANTHONY
"It's a biped. In a sheep or cow, a quadroped."
_RIPLEY
"Shit. I just didn't think it could do that to animals."
_JOHN
"Wait a minute - I thought you were the expert on this monster."
_RIPLEY
"Is that the only reason you came to get me out? Because I knew about this thing?"
_JOHN
"Yes. I mean no. I mean, that was part of it. Look. I never thought you were wrong. I was wrong not to say anything. I was afraid to speak up. It's hard to be a  monk, you know?"
Ripley stops. Looks at him  long beat.
_RIPLEY
"Thank you. If anything, you're honest."
_JOHN
"We all are. Took vows."
_RIPLEY
"I don't know about the Abbot."
_JOHN
"I'm sure he thinks what he did was right."
_RIPLEY
"Is that speaking up for someone?"
_JOHN
"No. Charity."
She smiles. They turn a corner.. NT. SLOPING CORRIDOR - NIGH his hallway slopes downwards a few degrees. The three find hemselves trotting, leaning backward to keep their balance.

"Not for years."
_RIPLEY
"Okay -- If the Alien's had a few days to lay his eggs our only hope is to get off this - What is this?"
_JOHN
"Arceon."
_ANTHONY
"Satellite."
_RIPLEY
"Get to my ship and get off this Satellite."
_JOHN
"We can't."
_RIPLEY
"We can't what?"
_JOHN
"Leave Arceon. Can't leave the library --"
_RIPLEY
"A Tape Library?"
_JOHN
"Books."
_RIPLEY
"So?"
_JOHN
"The reason we are out here. Like the Monks who guarded Monastery Libraries  on remote islands off England during the First Plague --"
_RIPLEY
"There must be books on other colonies --"
_JOHN
"Some of these books survived the burning of the Libraries of Alexandria. They contain knowledge that exists in no  other record. Their value is unestimable."
He runs his hand along the spine of the book in his bag.
_JOHN
"We're supposed to protect them."
_RIPLEY
(to Anthony)
"And what does an android have to do  with all this?"
_JOHN
"He's a spy."
_ANTHONY
"The Company planted me here."
_RIPLEY
"The Company? What does the Company have to do with this?"
_ANTHONY
"They built this prison."
_RIPLEY
"Prison?"
_JOHN
"Colony."
_ANTHONY
"Prison. They are all political heretics. "
Ripley looks at John.
_RIPLEY
"You left that part out."
_JOHN
"The order was more of a counter culture, a reaction to the Technology that was beginning to take over everyone's lives. It was a simple enough idea - Read, don't  watch disk. Walk, don't pump more carbons into the air. The earliest members renounced technology. Started to collect the remaining books. Nobody would have noticed if it hadn't been for the Virus."
_RIPLEY
"Your Abbot talked about that. The New Plague."
_ANTHONY
"A computer virus. A bad program. By this time the Corporate structure was transglobal, all the world's data storage systems were linked. It spread through two countries before it was stopped."
_JOHN
"After a scare like that, thousands flocked to our retreat. People started clamoring for written information. For our books. They abandoned the modern ways --"
_RIPLEY
"I think I can see how this comes out.  They gave up their possessions."
_ANTHONY
"This was a threat --"
_RIPLEY
"To the Company."
_JOHN
"They sold the technology. A movement  to live simply was quickly twisted by  Federal agents into a political movement against the Company-controlled World Government. Too much was at stake."
_RIPLEY
"Too much profit."
_JOHN
"We were sentenced as political dissidents. This orbiter is our gulag. All the men were packed up with all our books, and towed into space. Ten thousand men. The eldest died very quickly."
_RIPLEY
"The Company had such a sense of irony.  Sending you out on this wooden tub."
_ANTHONY
"I was placed among them as a sensor. Keeps tabs on the movement."
_RIPLEY
"So how'd they find out about you?"
_ANTHONY
"I told them. After the supply ship's stopped coming I saw no point in keeping up the charade. Since I was a sort of walking reminder of technology, they cast me down."
_RIPLEY
"Join the club."
(to John)
"I figured this wasn't planned. You don't have to be a genius to see it wouldn't be prudent to try to preserve man's written works for generations -- without women."
John looks embarrassed.
_RIPLEY
"And I don't know about your New Plague, but I was just on Earth and everything's  fine."
John has a doubtful look.
_RIPLEY
"I was right about the Alien, wasn't I? Means I must be right about the Earth."
The logic behind her argument is uncomfortable.
_JOHN
(beat)
"Perhaps."
_RIPLEY
"That's better than nothing. Come on."
They reach the end of the corridor t opens into - NT. TRANSOM SPACE - PRISON LEVE n enormous open space between "cell blocks. he Wall behind them is honey-combed with corridor opening oing up four stories, connected by aged, warped wooden ladder eminiscent of Indian cave dwellings. Only wooden he room stretches several football field lengths ahead of the - falling off into gloom hey stand silent for a moment, dwarfed by the size of the roo nd the task ahead of them. Finally --
_RIPLEY
"At any rate, let's forget about the Earth completely - whether you're right or I'm right what's important is getting the hell out of here. From here my ship is...?"
John points up at the ceiling.
_ANTHONY
"In Heaven."
_RIPLEY
"Right. And this is..."
Anthony and John nod.
_ANTHONY
"This orbiter was patterned after a  medieval concept of the universe --"
(makes a circle in the air)
"They call the top half "Heaven - ""
_JOHN
"The Abbey, the fields --"
_ANTHONY
"The bottom half is "Hell." Where we are."
_RIPLEY
"Aptly named. What's in the middle?"
_JOHN
"The sea."
_ANTHONY
"Really."
_RIPLEY
"Work with me here. How far is it back to the surface of the planet?"
_JOHN
"As a stone falls --- Five miles through the center."
_RIPLEY
"And the elevator -- the thing they lowered me down in?"
_JOHN 
"Ropes cut."
_ANTHONY
"It's smart. First he cuts their escape off, then works his way down through the  monastery level by level until there isn't a thing left alive. Interesting..."
_RIPLEY
"Well, you start appreciating him more than me and I'll find a way to shut you down, capisce, Andy? How do we get up?"
_JOHN
"There are ladders."
She stops. John and Anthony continue on a few steps and the top and walk back to her.
_RIPLEY
"Five miles with the Alien between us and there? Good luck, boys."
She turns and heads back towards her cell - ohn catches her shoulder --
_JOHN
"You can't --"
_RIPLEY
"Can't what? Not help you go to your deaths? I've had my fill of that."
_JOHN
"I need you. I can't do it alone."
_RIPLEY
"I've fought these creatures twice before. It take a lot to kill these things. Heavy artillery."
_ANTHONY
"We don't have weapons here."
_RIPLEY
"How about something we can make weapons from? Do you have anything like that -- any modern things here?"
John SHAKES his head vehemently --
_JOHN
"We renounced technology. It was those things that caused the Plague."
_RIPLEY
"This is a man-made planet. Something has to be recirculating your air, your water."
_JOHN
"God?"
_RIPLEY
"Please."
_JOHN
"I don't know. I just took it for granted."
_RIPLEY
"Most people do. Without some sort of technology we haven't got a chance."
From behind them:
_ANTHONY
"There is technology."
John and Ripley turn to look at him.
_ANTHONY
"A room. A Technology room. Fresh air and water come out."
_RIPLEY
"An atmosphere processing plant --"
_ANTHONY
"The heart and lungs of Arceon."
_RIPLEY
"Where is it?"
_ANTHONY
"One level beneath the underground sea."
_JOHN
"That's five levels up --"
_ANTHONY
(points into the gloom)
"On the other side of the orbiter."
John looks at Ripley --
_JOHN
"A chance."
Ripley looks from John's earnest face to the darkness and back.
_RIPLEY
"All right. You've got me - so far. But here's the deal: I don't know how many of your brethren are going to be alive when we get up there, but if we make it to my ship, you're all coming with me. We'll take as many of your precious books as we can carry, but we're going. I'm not going to fight this thing again to  end up alone again. Understand?"
John nods his head.
_RIPLEY
"We're all dead anyway. We might as well go fi --"
She feels a TWINGE in her midsection - oubles over. Anthony and John each take an arm --
_RIPLEY
"Ugh - I'm all right."
She takes a deep breath.
_RIPLEY
"Still thawing out. I hate hyper sleep... Come on."
_CUT TO:
INT. ARCEON - MONASTERY LEVEL - NIGH he formerly idyllic landscape has been reduced to a scorche attlefield. Wooden huts leveled. Small fires dot the land he air thick with ash and greasy smoke OZENS OF MONKS swarm across the countryside like ants on a ound of spilt sugar.

_ABBOT
(sotto)
"Stay together. Together..."
Then another movement catches the Abbot's eye - HEAD of the Monks - the wheat waves against the wind egins to ripple -- the wheat flattens  TRAIL forms omeTHING is MOVING in the long grass oving towards the Lead Monk -- FAST he Abbot opens his mouth as if to shout a warning - eve hough the Monk closest to the moving trail is too far away t ear him - before he can make a sound The Alien closes the gap  eeling horribly helpless he can only watch a ARGH-Aa - he Lead Monk gives one strangled CRY before he disappear eneath the surface of the long grass. His taper fall mong the long, dry stalks -- begins to SMOKE.. he Abbot can see the trail moving towards his men before the an. He finds his voice:
_ABBOT
"Run! RUN!"
The Monks in the field turn from the spot where the Mon creamed towards the Abbot -- TURN THEIR BACKS to the no oving again trail --
_ABBOT
"No - NO. The --"
The Alien hits the skirmish line at a flanking angle - AKING through five Monks like a scythe through wheat is tail, arms WHIP out - NAP their spines like kindling ost torches ignite the wheat.. he field BURSTS INTO FLAME moke fills the air n the smoky commotion the Monks break rank and start running eapons in front of them -- SWINGING wildly - creaming.

Its no rass-like lips draw back into a ghastly parody of a smile he Abbot SCREAMS and RUNS.
_JOHN O/S
"It isn't your fault, you know."
INT. TRANSOM SPACE - SERIES OF SHOT hey move across the huge room...Anthony a few paces ahead heir candles throwing only enough light to see several yards ind whistles through the huge room, timbers creaking like som igantic old house settling.
_RIPLEY
"What?"
_JOHN
"Those things you said before --"
Ripley remembers her "confession."
_JOHN
"I read about it in psychology books. Sometimes when people outlive someone they cared for, they transfer some of the guilt for that person's death to themselves."
_RIPLEY
"I got a belly full of that from the Psychtechs when I was on Earth. Yeah."
 "Survivor Guilt syndrome," or something
"like that. But that's not what I was thinking about. I was thinking about my "friend" up there."
She looks up.
_RIPLEY
"He was on the pod. He killed Newt but not me. Why not me? It's almost like he's playing with me. Maybe they have some sort of race memory. Maybe he knows what I did to his "mother." That's why he didn't just kill me. That would be too easy. He has to torment me."
_JOHN
"You make it sound human."
_RIPLEY
"Hell, I don't know what it is."
John unconsiously fingers his book.
_JOHN
"I think I do."

_RIPLEY
"Thanks."
_JOHN
"You're welcome."
They roll off each other er hand goes up to her nose lood.
_RIPLEY
"I'm all right."
John reaches into his bag, withdraws a small cotton bag.
_JOHN
"Hold this against your nose. It'll stop the flow."
She looks over at him questioningly.
_JOHN
"I'm a doctor."
She holds the small bag against her nose. The bleeding stops hey move over to Anthony - try to help him to his feet e shakes them off.
_ANTHONY
"No - please. Just let me sit. Awhile."
He rubs his temples. White, milk-like sweat runs down hi heek.
_ANTHONY
"Damn it."
_RIPLEY
"What was that?"
_ANTHONY
"The reason I'm down here."
John points to his own eyes.
_JOHN
"Visions."
_ANTHONY
"Dreams."
_RIPLEY
"Androids can't dream..."
_ANTHONY
"That's probably what they thought when they built me. But my brain is cyber- organic - patterned after the human brain - it functions the same way a human brain does. It accumulates random images and sensations during waking  hours, but unlike the human brain that sloughs them off during sleep --"
_RIPLEY
"Androids don't sleep."
_ANTHONY
"Right. Maybe they've fixed this on later models, but I don't. Do you know what  happens to the human brain when it is deprived of sleep? It starts to run off the dreams while you're awake, as  hallucinations. Same thing with me. For twenty years I absorbed data on this planetoid. A little after we lost contact with Earth the visions started. They thought I was insane. I had to explain  that it was because I was an android. They liked that even less."
_RIPLEY
"What did you see?"
_ANTHONY
"What I always see. Images of Monsters. Demons."
_JOHN
"They're portents. They stand for an evil yet to come."
_ANTHONY
"Just images I've absorbed from those old books and have no way to get rid of."
_RIPLEY
"I saw the inside of your cell."
_ANTHONY
(shrugs)
"My head is full of them. I try to get them out any way I can."
His eyelids droop.
_JOHN
"You need sleep."
_ANTHONY
"I know that. I'll settle for rest."
He closes his eyes. Ripley recovers the torch.
_RIPLEY
"Stay with him."
Ripley tried to stand - John takes her arm, pulls her down.
_JOHN
"No. We all need rest. You especially."
Ripley considers him.
_JOHN
"Doctor's orders."
She smiles and sits.
_JOHN
"Besides, you see what happens when you get ahead of us. We should stay together."
_RIPLEY
"All right. He's still above us, anyway."
_JOHN
"What do you mean?"
_RIPLEY
"I've faced this evil twice before - I guess I've gotten sensitive to it --"
(beat)
"You're really a Doctor?"
John pats his canvas bag.
_JOHN
"See my bag?"
_RIPLEY
"What's that book?"
_JOHN
"Just a book."
_RIPLEY
"I don't buy "just a book" from a guy who says we can't leave the planet without the library."
 
_JOHN
"It's just... a medical book I might need."
_RIPLEY
"You don't have any food in there, do you?"
_JOHN
"Only if you can eat bandages."
Ripley rubs her midsection.
_RIPLEY
"In a few hours that's going to sound good. Going in and out of suspended animation - Christ I probably haven't eaten in a year."
_ANTHONY
(without opening eyes)
"You should've eaten the bread."
_RIPLEY AND JOHN
"Rest!"
Ripley lets her head loll back against the wall loses her eyes. Time passes er brow knits ohn sees this.
_JOHN
"You all right?"
_RIPLEY
"Aces."
_JOHN
"You weren't hurt when I landed on you? Bruised a rib?"
He reaches over and puts his hands beneath her cassock eels her midsection. His hands are warm.
_RIPLEY
"Are you sure you're a doctor?"
He withdraws his hands.
_JOHN
"Sort of. My father passed on when we  first came here. The Abbey's Physician - Father Anselm - took me in. He really raised me --"
(pause)
"Taught me what he could before he passed away. He was schooled on Earth."
_RIPLEY
"Well, I'm just hungry."
_JOHN
"You haven't eaten since I took you out of your tube."
_RIPLEY
"You did that..."
She reaches out and takes hold of his hands. Turns them over.
_RIPLEY
"You burned yourself on the escape pod."
Her hands on his makes him feel...uncomfortable.
_RIPLEY
"Thank you, I guess."
They look into each other's eyes --
_ANTHONY O/S
"You should've eaten the bread."
Ripley, embarrassed, releases his hands ooks at Anthony. He's trying to stand.
_ANTHONY
"Enough rest. There's beasties afoot."
They start into..  NARROW CORRIDO eiling so low their torches must be held out in front of them ipley makes an effort not to move faster than the two monks NT. LADDER SHAF  great long ladder hanging in the middle of nowhere eems at least a mile long he group climbs..  SERPENTINE CORRIDO iquid drips through the ceiling planks over head alls into RED puddles on the slanted floor ohn kneels, dips his fingertips --
_JOHN
"Blood."
(sniffs)
"Mixed with sea water."
_ANTHONY
"We're getting close to the center of the arc -- near the sea."
_RIPLEY
"Blood."
_JOHN
"Getting close..."
John HEARS somthing aises his hand -- "stop he group stops. Flatten themselves against the wall ohn takes Anthony's staff oves forward with it held out in front of him.. HIRLS around a blind corner - HOVES something against the wall - hump t struggles - ipley and Anthony run up -- raise their tapers - evealing:
_RIPLEY
"The Abbot."
Cassock torn, dirty. Hair, eyes wild nthony's staff across his throat. ohn pulls back.
_JOHN
"Father --"
_RIPLEY
(sarcastic)
"What are you doing down here, father? You look like you've seen something that doesn't exist."
The Abbot runs his fingers through his hair. Smoothes it down.
_ABBOT
"I was their spiritual leader. I was not prepared to lead them in battle. Not against that thing."
_JOHN
"No one could be."
_RIPLEY
"I thought you said the evil was inside me -- that sealing me up was the answer to all your problems?"
_ABBOT
"Destruction. The destruction YOU brought to us!"
_RIPLEY
"I only tried to warn you."
_ABBOT
"What are you doing with this woman --?"
_JOHN
"We are going to the Technology Room. Trying to find some way to fight --"
_ABBOT
"You don't join the devil to fight the devil."
_ANTHONY
"She's helping us --"
_ABBOT
"Look who defends the deceiver -- the one who isn't even human. John, can't you see what is happening? On ancient Earth, during the Black Death - many believed that God had abandoned them, so they appealed to the Devil. Flocked to him hoping to save their bodies - losing their souls in the bargain."
_RIPLEY
"Father, we're all on the run from the  same monster so let's not resort to the fire and brimstone routine. I've been enlightened about your "movement." Pretty funny to be tried for heresy on a planet of heretics."
_JOHN
"Please. "
The time for pretense is past.
_ABBOT
"All right. I was trying to keep you quiet. "
_JOHN
"Sir --?"
_ABBOT
"I do what I have to do to keep the Brotherhood together. We all gave up believing in Earth a long time ago. How do you think they would feel if told their exiled was in vain? That the holocaust they were trying to avoid never occured? Those men up there have grown to live with it."
_RIPLEY
"And with you as their leader."
The Abbot smiles. Ripley is sharp.
_ABBOT
"You threatened the status quo."
_RIPLEY
"So you, protector of knowledge and truth, lied to them."
_ABBOT
"Only about you. The rest I still believe. If Earth still orbits its sun there is no way it could have survived being reduced to Barbarism."
_RIPLEY
"You're as bad as the Company."
_JOHN
"Ripley --"
_RIPLEY
"That's why you ran. After all your talk death stared you in the face and you were afraid."
_ABBOT
"Not afraid of death."
_RIPLEY
"The Alien."
_ANTHONY
"The Organism."
_ABBOT
"The Devil."
INT. TECHNOLOGY ROOM CORRIDO he now four refugees work their way into the final corridor ark. Turns at sharp angles. Blind alleys he floor is uneven, wood aged and twisted arped by years of water dripping from above he group strings out as it moves into the darkness, candle eld high.. NTHON ringing up the rear, puts his walking stick down - NAPP!! verybody stops at the sound.
_ABBOT
"What was that?"
Anthony pulls his stick from the grasp of a--
_ANTHONY
"Man trap."
They lower their candles. Look to HE FLOO nterspersed throughout the timbers - pring jawed, steel toothed, BEAR TRAPS usted. Open. And all around them.
_ANTHONY
"In case anyone tried to get in and tamper with the technology."
The four of them are standing in the middle of a mine-field o an traps. Nobody moves.
_ABBOT
"What do we do?"
_RIPLEY
"Don't move. Don't breath."
_ABBOT
"We can't just stand here and wait."
_RIPLEY
"Floor's too unstable to try to walk around them."
John pulls a loose board from the corridor wall urns and kneels at the trap in front of him okes the end of the board into the jaws.. NAP! he others jump at the sound --
_ABBOT
"John - what are you doing?"
John pulls the stick out of the rusted jaws oves to the next trap - nap!!
_RIPLEY
"He's thinking like a leader. Everyone: Grab wood. Spring the traps. Clear a path."
(proud of him)
"Good work, Father John."
_JOHN
"Brother."
_RIPLEY
"Brother. Let's go."
Ripley pulls a plank from the wall next to her. xposes a bit of the surface underneath - t's METAL he touches the cool, familiar material. Smiles ow she knows this is not a dream he turns and SPRINGS the trap in front of her - NAP! HE FOU lowly make their way down the corridor, one hand holding  andle high, the other poking a piece of wood into the trap i ront of them... SNAP-SNAP...SNAP. SNAP alking carefully around the yet unfired traps... HE DOOR TO THE TECHNOLOGY ROO  huge wooden door with no knob or handle. Looks like it coul lmost be part of the wall. John and Ripley are the first t t. They put down their planks and begin to feel around th dges of the door for some purchase he Abbot joins them ACK IN THE CORRIDO nthony lags behind. He senses a presence in the hallway ears a sound behind him e see a GLIMPSE of something - e turns towards the sound - mpty hallway e thinks. Starts forward again -- with his ear cocked to th ear... SNAP T THE DOO ipley, John and The Abbot knock on the door, walls ipley leans her head against the wall in frustration an xhaustion. To get this far, and be locked out he feels sick to her stomach ow long since she had food he looks over at John e is staring at her e turns red at being caught. Cute.
_JOHN
"I just - are you allright?"
_RIPLEY
"Tied. Without sleep, food -- I just feel my age."
(smiles)
"Figuring hyperspace time, I'm almost a hundred."
She wipes her brow and goes back to knocking...
_JOHN
"Hello?"
The wall beneath his fist sounds hollow ingernails find the edge of the plank and pull - he plank slides aside on tiny, rusty pneumatic pistons EHIND THE PLAN  primitive KEYBOARD. Circa late twentieth century.
_JOHN
"I think this is it."
Ripley and the Abbot move over to see.
_ABBOT
"Technology."
_RIPLEY
"Yeah - a hundred years ago. An antique."
_ABBOT
(to Ripley)
"Go ahead."
_RIPLEY
"Go ahead and what?"
_ABBOT
"Open the door, woman."
_RIPLEY
"I'll get to it, but listen to me -- you may dress like you're living in the middle ages but you can't treat me like your chambermaid, or whatever Monks had."
UP THE HALL - ANTHON ears the sound again. Turns othing again e pauses... Turns back quickly - he wooden wall MOVES - steps forward - HE ALIE dapted itself to look like WOOD t's body changes -- transmutes -- Cable-like sinew snakin ver grained limbs to approximate the more traditional bio echnoid alien appearance... NTHONY PO he weary android sees the Alien as a conglommoration of hi any Medieval images of demons. He hears the Alien's hollow aspy breath. It glides towards him.. nthony steps back directly INTO A TRAP as his mind goes - NAP! he STEEL JAWS spring shut on his left ankle ilky blood-fluid starts to flow e finds himself in the same predicament as his vision - nkle pinned, the Alien's appendages circling him - e screams. AAAAAAAAAAAARGH -- T THE DOO ipley is trying to work. She punches numbers into the keyboard he is too exhausted to see straight hey HEAR the scream - ohn RUNS back - raps SNAPPING around him - ipley turns towards the sound - he Abbot pushes her back to the keyboard --
_ABBOT
"OPEN IT!!"

_JOHN
"I thought we'd lost you."
_RIPLEY
"What are you writing?"
_JOHN
"Last will and testament."
(beat)
"Just kidding."
She looks to her left nthony is lying on his back, cotton bandage wrapped around hi yes. His ankle is a swollen mess. Wires are hanging out.
_RIPLEY
"Is he --?"
_JOHN
"Resting."
(shakes his head)
"He'll be fine."
_ANTHONY
"No I won't. He's a terrible liar."
_RIPLEY
"I'm sorry."
_ANTHONY
"It's ironic. I guess my visions were prescience after all. How will I ever resolve that with my artifical con- science?"
A creaking floorboard to Ripley's right draws her attention t he Abbot. He's pacing.
_ABBOT
"Do you see what you've delivered us into?"
_RIPLEY
"Yeah. Lead me not into temptation to kick your -- ahh --"
Ripley tries to stand - her head spins HOOSH...WHOOSH...
_RIPLEY
"Oh shit."
The entire room THROBS with the rhythm of the wind.
_RIPLEY
"Where is the Big Boy -?"
The Abbot points to the door.
_ABBOT
"On the other side of that door. Waiting for us to starve to death."
Ripley moves to the door and feels it's cold surface.
_RIPLEY
"It's playing with us. It could get in here any time it wants."
_ABBOT
"Why should he enter? He knows that one of the people in this room is in league with him."
_JOHN
"Sir. We're all in the same coracle, so to speak."
_ABBOT
"Maybe more than one of us."
_RIPLEY
"Let's talk about the facts, Mr. Abbot."
She looks at the windmills HOOSH...WHOOSH...
_RIPLEY
"This is your technology?"
_ABBOT
"Even this is forbidden to us."
_RIPLEY
"Well then, the facts are that we're screwed."
She moves into the room. Walks around one of the Windmills.
_RIPLEY
"An Eco system. Nothing to recycle your atmosphere except the green plants. Winds generated down here --"
(looks at the floor)
"Windmills use the natural surface winds to turn wheels underground, create tides on the seas to recirculate your water..."
_ANTHONY
"More than that. There are pumps beneath the floor - I can feel their vibration."
_RIPLEY
"Probably pumping this air through charcoal filters."
WHOOSH...WHOOSH...
_RIPLEY
"It gets colder all the time here, right?"
John looks at her questioningly.
_JOHN
"Yes..."
_RIPLEY
"Your wood burning fires throw soot into the atmosphere, building the cloud layer - cutting off the sun's rays - cooling the planet, forcing you to burn more wood."
WHOOSH...WHOOSH...
_ANTHONY
"The Greenhouse Effect. It's how the Earth almost destroyed itself in the late 20th century."
_RIPLEY
"Don't you see? This is a planet set to self destruct. Not in ten minutes or two hours but soon. Your atmosphere here is finite. If the plants die the fires will eat up all the oxygen - this planetoid will be dead - Everyone will die."
The Abbot has the look of a man who has been beaten in the last ew meters of a Marathon.
_ABBOT
"It's here. I was just hoping I would be dead long before it came to this."
_JOHN
"What?"
_ABBOT
"We're supposed to die here. That's the point."
_RIPLEY
"Wait a minute -- you were exiled --?"
_ABBOT
"The punishment for our crime was death."
Anthony sits up.
_ANTHONY
"This planet is the supreme triumph of planned obsolesence. A certain amount of primitive materials with an atmosphere processing system as fragile as a real environment but not replenishable."
The Abbot has a faraway look in his eyes...
_ABBOT
"Poetic justice for the anti-technologists. The Company's best work. You know, I used to be a corporate executive. Middle range V.P. Then my wife got hit by a speed craft. I chucked it all and joined the order. Be a monk -- see the world. Being here, being chairman of the board..."
_RIPLEY
"No, now I understand why I landed here. To join you happy lunatics in your  deaths."
Ripley moves away.. ohn starts after her.
_JOHN
"Ripley, wait --"
The Abbot stands, blocks his way.
_ABBOT
"Where can she go? She's trapped."
(beat)
"Trapped inside her own prison. A prison in her mind. Inside her mind. Dancing. Sparklets of light - dance with the june bugs in the recesses of ourmindstheyare coming to danceintheshadowof..."
John and Ripley turn to look at the Abbot e begins to speak faster. Faster e shakes. Vibrates is more accurate -  trickle of BLOOD runs from his left ear...

_RIPLEY
"BASTARD!! It came out of his fucking head!"
_ANTHONY
"I didn't have to see that to know what that means."
_RIPLEY
"He sent him to us. That bastard outside. I can't get away from him. He's fucking with my mind. He's my punishment!"
_ANTHONY
"I'm confused. Before you said it came out of the torso, not the head --"
_RIPLEY
"I don't feel like a discussion of Alien biology."
John comes up next to her.
_JOHN
"Ripley, don't --"
She pushes him away and sinks to the floor.
_RIPLEY
"I should just wait for the air to run out..."
_JOHN
"I believe - I know - that we can win -- there is an answer in our books."
_RIPLEY
"Your books? Your books are gone, Brother. Your world is gone. Once that thing starts to lay its eggs, all your brothers - if they aren't already - are dead."
_JOHN 
"If that's true, then all of us, the books, are consigned to ashes."
He clasps his hands and bows his head he Abbot's blood drips off his hands lip - plop nto a little puddle at Ripley's feet he stares at the blood. Aahk eels the PAIN again uns her hand across her chest...
_ANTHONY O/S
"Ripley?"
_RIPLEY
"What?"
_ANTHONY
"There are several inconsistancies between this and the other Aliens you described."
_RIPLEY
"Give it up."
_ANTHONY
"I think this is important. This may help us fight it. The creature that I fought in the hall - when I first saw it, it had camoflaged itself to look like wood."
Ripley looks up.
 
_RIPLEY
"Wood? When I saw it in my room it looked the way it did before -- black, mechanical -- unless that was a dream."
_ANTHONY
"I don't think it was. I think that this  creature, if it is the efficient predator that you say it is, has the ability to adapt to its environment."
_RIPLEY
"Then the reason they've always looked the same to me is that I only ever saw them in the same environment."
_ANTHONY
"Or this may be an as yet unseen stage of development -- you saw a queen -- This could be like a King ant -- more highly advanced than the drone, bred for  survival -?"
_JOHN
"How does this explain the thing that came out of the ewe's chest? The Abbot's head?"
_RIPLEY
"Maybe it can deposit different types of eggs. The chest burster is probably dormant until the host eats - The first one I ever saw came out of Kane after he started to eat --"
And in one horrible moment she realizes he hasn't eaten. The pain in her chest...
_RIPLEY
"No."
Anthony "looks" towards her - does he realize as well?
_JOHN
"No what?"
_RIPLEY
"No, we're not beat yet, Father --"
_JOHN
"Brother --"
Ripley gets up.
_RIPLEY
"Brother. Not yet. If he's taunting me, then maybe we can use that. We can beat this bastard. We can get to my ship. We can live."
_CUT TO:
INT. TECHNOLOGY ROO ohn stands by a ladder that runs up to a trap door in the eiling. Holds a torch ipley is on the ground with Anthony, his injured leg splayed ut in front of him. Skin is palid.
_ANTHONY
"Don't have second thoughts. Blind and crippled I would only slow you down. Give him time to figure out what you're doing. Just leave me my staff."
_RIPLEY
"Okay. Good luck."
She shakes his hand. He pulls her closer nthony's empty eye sockets seem to see as he looks at Ripley.
_ANTHONY
"Ripley, I know. Good luck."
_RIPLEY
"Sit tight."
Ripley crosses to John. Poised at the bottom of the ladder the ook up at the trap door on the ceiling.
_RIPLEY
"He could be waiting on the other side of that door. We might not get ten feet before he kills the three of us."
He shakes his head.
_JOHN
"We had better go, then."
He smiles he smiles back hey move up the ladder t leads up a damp, short shaft, walls GREEN with algae, t N UNDERGROUND DOCK - NIGH he ladder shaft opens onto a barnacled pier. Ripley and Joh limb out onto the wooden structure. Before them N UNDERGROUND SEA stretches the width of the entire planet ver five miles across. The floor of the lowest level of th op half of the orbiter makes a ceiling that looms a hundre eet overhead he water sparkles with a golden glow.
_JOHN
"Must be day on the surface of the planet."
_RIPLEY
"Where is the light coming from?"
 
_JOHN
"Mirrors. Reflect the outside light down great shafts -- through lenses. That's what they make in the glass factory.  Lenses. Look --"
She turns  HUGE WATERFAL it from within by daylight beaming down from above -- pour nto the sea a short distance from them.
_JOHN
"Opens to the surface. Water flows in and out. I don't know how. There's one at either end. I came down on the other side."
_RIPLEY
"What do we do?"
John points to three small leather and wood coracles bobbing a he end of their ropes.
_JOHN
"We cross."
INT. TECHNOLOGY ROOM - DA nthony has dragged himself to a sitting position against th ottom of one of the windmills. He winces as he prods hi ender ankle with the end of his staff. It SPARKS he large canvas arms of the windmill rotate above his head he wind blows through his hair HOOSH...WHOOSH.. eels good nthony reaches up and waves his hand of his "eyes."
_ANTHONY
"Now the seer can only see what God wants him to. Forty years on a planet of Monks and I've finally found religion."
A floor board CREAKS nthony strains to hear:
_ANTHONY
"John? Ripley?"
WHOOSH...WHOOSH.. e knows it is not.
_ANTHONY
"Well come then. I haven't got forever."
A shadow falls across his face. He can feel it e doesn't have to see what is here HE UNDERGROUND OCEAN - DAY INTO NIGH he leather boat makes its way across the sea ohn rows while Ripley holds the torch aloft s night falls she takes the oars he Ocean is dead calm. The coracle glides across the glass ike surface. John flexes his scarred fingers.
_RIPLEY
"Your hands okay?"
_JOHN
"They'll be fine. You've been on a boat before."
Ripley squints ahead of them he ocean seems to go on forever.
_RIPLEY
"I was a warrant officer on a ship -- but I did all my sailing in space."
_JOHN 
"Father Anselm used to take me on his coracle when I was little."
Ripley leans forward - scans his face.
_RIPLEY
"How old were you when they towed this satellite out here? "
_JOHN
"Five. The Abbot said they put us to  sleep for the thirty years it took to get here. We've had almost forty more. Until now."
_RIPLEY
"What happened to your mother?"
_JOHN
"Never had one. I mean, never knew her. I mean, I did, once. She left my father when he joined the movement. If she hadn't I wouldn't be here. They kept the other children with the women, on Earth. That was too long ago now. Like a dream."
Ripley's face grows strangely dark. She turns to the water.
_RIPLEY
"Did you know that I was a mother?"
_JOHN
"The girl in the ship with -?"
_RIPLEY
"No. On Earth. I never mentioned my daughter. My daughter. I have - had I guess, by now - a daughter on Earth. Kathy. She was nine when I signed on to the Nostromo. Mommy will be home before you know it I said. My shares would have set us up good. Then I lost sixty years floating around in a rescue pod. Thanks to the Alien. I came home to face a bitter, 70 year old woman. My daughter. A little girl who's mother never came home."
_JOHN
"Jesus Christ."
_RIPLEY
"They said I should have been happy to be alive. Funny, huh? That's why I went back the second time. Not so I could fight it -- You can't fight it -- So I could let it kill me."
She rubs her chest --
_JOHN
"You didn't choose to get lost in space."
_RIPLEY
"Thanks for the try Father --"
_JOHN
"Brother."
_RIPLEY
"Brother, but I'm not looking for absolution. I couldn't be a good mother to my daughter. I couldn't be a good mother to Newt. But I can be a good mother to you. I can make sure you survive."
Suddenly they feel rain - ipley holds out her hand er eyes open wide at what she sees ohn takes the oars as she holds the torch over the side he Ocean has become red with BLOOD lood DRIPS down from the ceiling around them.
_RIPLEY
"Blood."
John looks up.
_JOHN
"From the levels above."
His face goes white.
_JOHN
"He must have slaughtered all --"
_RIPLEY
"Don't think about it. Don't think about what's up there. Just row."
As Ripley takes the torch away from the water, tiny ripples mov cross the surface he doesn't notice  SHAP asses underneath the boat. A swimming CREATURE. The Alien hanks to the reflective qualities of water, it appears HUGE warfs their coracle NT. TECHNOLOGY ROOM - NIGH ll the windmills are BURNING laming arms lazily turning nthony is not in sight hoosh...Whoosh.. HE OTHER SIDE OF THE OCEAN - NIGH nother dock with ladders going up and down ipley and John climb out of the coracle on't waste time tying off. They go - P THE LADDE  hundred foot climb. The wood is twisted ungs have been torn away in some places hey pull themselves up sections that have only the tinies oothold. The temperature rises as they do weat runs into their eyes oon they can see the floor above them LACKENED by intense heat hey climb NT. UNDERGROUND WHEAT FIELDS - NIGH ipley and John come up from the level below.
_RIPLEY
"Holy shit."
John crosses himself nother testament to the terrible battle with the Alien educed to just a huge, blackened floor ll the crops burned to ash - heir charred stalks mingled with the corpses of roasted Monks heir nostrils assailed by the stench of the dead - ipley would puke if she had any food in her body.
_JOHN
"There's Andrew. And Raphael. Peter..."
_RIPLEY
"Stop. How far?"
_JOHN
"We're right below the Abbey now."
They cross the smoldering field he scorched floor threatens to give way under John's feet - ipley pull him to one side HE MONASTERY LEVE eaven has become HELL he ground, the buildings, the Sky-timber - all blackened IRES burn everywhere. Air choked with gray smoke and dus ouring in from the Orbiter's surface through rends in th aulted ceiling IPLEY AND JOH limb through a hole where a trap door has been torn off it's inges. They look at the grim tableau onks impaled on their own pikes angled together in their own pungy stakes lien cocoon material cobwebbed over their bodies HE MONASTER lickering fires lit the first few floor windows ipley takes a step towards it - eaches back and pulls John.. NT. GLASS FACTORY - NIGH he Glass furnace boils almost to the point of overflow mall fires burn out of control around the room inished glass pieces BURST from the heat ipley and John enter.
_JOHN
"This is the glassworks. They have tools here --"
(spots)
"Kyle --"
He runs across the room - ROTHER KYL its calmly at the Marver table e places playing cards on the table in front of him olitaire. e sings to himself quietly.
_KYLE
(sotto)
"Can't see my baby. Don't see my baby. Bay be."
John grabs him by the lapels - pulls him to his feet he playing cards fall to the floor - yle watches them, not John.
_JOHN
"Kyle. Brother Kyle."
_KYLE
"Cards on the floor, fifty two pickup. Black king on red queen, put the ace up --"
John SHAKES him.
_JOHN
"Kyle goddammit!"
Ripley moves closer.
_RIPLEY
"John - it's too late --"
Kyle begins to sing faster. Faster.
_KYLE
"Ace up. Put the ace up. Redaceupup. Blackaceup.Up.Pup-pup-pup-chaka- boomloommawhacka -- Booomalooma looma --"
Ripley and John look at each other hey know what this means ohn pulls a length of rope off a nearby table oves in front of Kyle. Looks into his glassy eyes  tear runs down his cheek.
_JOHN
"Keep singing, my friend."
John loops the rope around Kyle's neck trangles him ases the lifeless body to the floor tares at it IPLE ulls a blowing iron from the rack. Feels its weight an alance. A reasonable weapon. She crosses to John.
_JOHN
"I killed him. I'm a doctor and I killed him."
_RIPLEY
"You had to. You're supposed to end suffering."
She hands him a pontil, a pointed iron spear used to form th olten glass shapes.
_RIPLEY
"Let's get the hell out of here."
INT. STAIRWELL - NIGH ipley and John move up the stairs lickering orange lit from below moke and soot rise from the first on the lower floors NT. LIBRARY - NIGH hey enter carefully. The room is exactly as John left it ooks out of shelves, hanging on their chains.
_RIPLEY
"He's made a mess."
John pushes ahead of her.
_JOHN
"No. He hasn't been up here yet. I  did this."
He moves to the nearest shelf and uses his pontil to pry ope he lock --
_JOHN
"Here - philosophy - we'll start here --"
AAAROO --  HAIRY BLUR flies out from between the stacks - HUMPH! Knocks John to the floor - icks his face.
_JOHN
"Mattias!"
The happy dog leaps all over his master.
_JOHN 
"He waited. Ripley, this is Mattias. My dog. Good fellow."
Ripley crosses to them.
_RIPLEY
"I'm glad. Really. But we've probably only got a few minutes before this entire place goes up in flames. Just grab whatever books you want and --"
Ripley leans in to pet Mattias attias draws his lip back. Growls e's looking over Ripley's shoulder he turns around slowly.. HE ALIE tanding in the open doorway t's in bad shape from the man traps ost a foot. Tongue hanging out, useless arts of it look like wood. Parts of it look like wheat t carries Anthony's waterlogged, limp body - OPS off his head like a grape from the bunch osses the corpse at Ripley's feet  could swear it's trying to smile IPLEY AND JOH ack against the book stacks ohn grabs Mattias' collar he Dog GROWLS at the Alien intruder...
_JOHN
"Easy, boy..."
_RIPLEY
"Is there another way out?"
_JOHN
"Not that will do us any good."
THE ALIE imps into the room dragging one foot t's breathing is labored. Dripping acid blood leaves a thi rail of fire behind it.
_JOHN
"We hurt it."
The Alien draws itself up to its full height - ven wounded it is one dangerous mother fucker.
_RIPLEY
"You wanna give it a bandage? Look -- Where is my ship from here?"
_JOHN
"On the roof directly above this room."
_RIPLEY
"Here's the plan --"
 
_JOHN
"But the books --"
_RIPLEY
"Forget the books!"
RUFF! attias pulls free from John's grasp - uns to the Alien --

Five feet away - the ledge th lying Fox is launched from. He looks down e can see the huge open vat of molten glass below him. To it ight, the Water DUMP TANK - a large wine cask-looking affai here finished pieces are cooled. He looks up ipley holding onto the edge of the broken floor above.
_JOHN
"Are you all right?"
Ripley grunts an affirmative response t least is she falls, it will only be a twenty-foot drop t he floor. John is looking at instant par-boiling ohn starts to move hand over hand UP the rope. He begins t weat  drop of sweat falls.. SSS OPS AND SIZZLES as it hits the surface of the molten glass - IPLE ries to pull herself up to the floor above - he next level is a raging fire he can only hang and DROP. She DOES - alls the two stories ends her knees and ROLLS on impact OH as reached the ledge overlooking the furnace e stands. Sees Ripley slowly rising --

"Ripley -!"
Ripley shakily gets to her feet ops on one foot.

She grabs her stomach as her knees give out ohn gives her an arm for support.
_JOHN
"We've got to get to the Library --"

"Don't worry. Ship. Just --"
They look up attias looks down through the hole in the floor ARKS.. NT. LIBRARY - NIGH n INFERNO very bookshelf ablaze. The floor dotted with pools of flame ipley and John are at the door - held back by the heat - ohn tries to enter the room - ipley grabs him --

"Some of them! I've got to save some of them! Mattias!!"
Mattias yelps in response. Threads his way through to them ipley spins him to face her. Tears stream down his cheeks.

She YANKS him into the hallway --

The Library is in flames ohn looks down at his medical bag orn, bloody, scorched, it still hangs from his shoulders nside: The only remaining book.
_RIPLEY O/S
"Come on in!"
John and Mattias step through - NT. SULACCO ESCAPE POD #4 - NIGH ipley CLICKS on the lights ohn lifts Mattias into the hatch.
_JOHN
"The Library --"
_RIPLEY
"I told you -- the Earth is still there --"
Ripley checks an instrument: Elapsed travel time er brows knit. She TAPS the gauge.
_RIPLEY
"Not working."
_JOHN
"What does that mean?"
_RIPLEY
"It means I don't know how long I was in hyper sleep."
_JOHN
"It means the Abbot could've been right --"
 
_RIPLEY
"It means my clock isn't working. We have to get out of here. Even if he was right this ship's onboard computer is filled  with man's knowledge."
_JOHN
"Not everything. Some things will be lost forever. "
_RIPLEY
"Then man starts over. He's done it before."
She pushes a few buttons. Somewhere under the floor a ropulsion source HUMS to life. THROBBING through the sole f John's feet. Ripley is absorbed in her work.
_RIPLEY
"Okay. The seals weren't broken so we're probably clear. But those dead monks out there are going to start hatching soon. Let's get ready to take off."
_JOHN
"What can I do?"
_RIPLEY
"Here, I need a compressor tank from in that compartment."
She motions towards an open door ohn enters the compartment hoosh-CLANG - he door closes behind him.
_JOHN
"Hey! What?!"
He looks out the window in the door. ipley is staring at him, punching keys on a pad next to th oor.
_JOHN
"Hey - I'm locked in."
Mattias scratches at the door.
_RIPLEY
"I know. I locked you in."
_JOHN
"What?"
_RIPLEY
"I'm not going with you. I've got one inside me."
 
_JOHN
"What?! You can't --"
She runs a hand across her midsection.
_RIPLEY
"I figured it out. That's why it didn't kill me. He must have impregnated me when I was in the stasis tube."
(remembers nightmare)
"It hasn't come out yet because I  haven't eaten, It's still dormant. So either I eat and it kills me or I don't eat and I starve to death. Either way  I die."
John pulls the Medieval Tome out of his medical bag.
_JOHN 
"My book -- I know what to do --"
_RIPLEY
"What, an exorcism? No good."
_JOHN
"You can't do this. Ripley - listen to me - you're confusing feeling of guilt for actual sin - I can help you --"
_RIPLEY
(ignoring)
"I've set a time lock. When the pod escapes the Colony's gravitational pull this compartment will open. Then all you have  to do is get into the Stasis tube with Mattias and press the blue button. With any luck a freighter or something will pick you up. Good luck."
He pounds his fists against the door.
_JOHN
"NO! No, Goddammit - you can't do this. You can't let it win."
She turns away from the door.
_RIPLEY
"It always wins. We killed it, but it's still inside me -- You're my last chance. If I can keep you alive it'll make up for all those I've lost."
_JOHN
"Listen to me! You have to let me try! Ripley: You're MY only chance!"
She's listening...
_JOHN
"I told you Father Anselm raised me. He raised me and when he was dying I couldn't do anything to save him. I  didn't know enough. It was my fault he died. If you don't let me try to save you my body will live but my soul will be dead."
Ripley turns and stares at him.
_JOHN
"Please."
_CUT TO:
THE PAG  MEDIEVAL ETCHING  Monk vomits up the devil ull back as John lowers Ripley to the pod floor ohn closes his eyes loses the book e pours some water into a small plastic cup etrieves a small pouch of herbs. Opens it rinkles his nose - they smell - ours these ancient medicines into the space age cup.
_RIPLEY
"What is this stuff?"
_JOHN
(forceful)
"Something that will make you well. Something that will make you sick."
_RIPLEY
"I don't --"
_JOHN
"Shut up and drink."
He lifts the back of Ripley's head - ORCES the drink down her throat ohn swings his leg over her midsection. STRADDLES her resses his two hands together in prayer hen balls them into one fist akes a deep, preparatory breath.. ipley starts to GAG -- Cough er body starts to JERK - ohn BRINGS HIS FIST DOWN INTO HER STOMACH - HAMM -! ipley CONVULSES -- has the dry heaves - HAM!

Fights to speak ipley raises herself up on one elbow lien mucous drooling down her chin air matted against her forehead.
_RIPLEY
"Why?"
 
_JOHN
"Choking. It was the only way."
He drops the open book in front of her he sees the etching OH ulps back the oozing slime truggles to his feet.
_JOHN
"They knew."
_RIPLEY
"But you --"
Ripley tries to stand - to go after him - he can't sit up -- feels like a rib might be cracked.
_RIPLEY
"You'll die --"
John stumbles to the Pod door. Turns back.
_JOHN 
"That's idea. Join...my brothers. If we were right, Heaven. If we were wrong -- either way, where we belong. World of books. Pages."
He draws the parchment out of his bag rops it to the floor.
_JOHN
"You... are from the real world."
He starts to step through the door - attias tries to follow.
_JOHN
"Stay -- both of you."
He exits the Pod ipley drags herself across the floor.
_RIPLEY
"No - wait! John!"

_JOHN V.O.
"I, Brother John Goldman of the orbiter Arceon, Minorite abbey and gaol, know the Abbot was wrong. There is a great evil here. I have seen it. I put pen to paper now lest this plague - this creature stills my hand. I have gone down below - both to try to warn the others and get  the woman - Ripley - get from her some clue as to how to battle this evil, or at least to make my peace for not defending her. She believes there is still and Earth and I hope she is right. I hope she will be able to find out. I hope she can find some rest for the devils that torment her."
Ripley looks at the elapsed time counter on the comman onsole. Pulls a pen from it's holder. She adds:
_RIPLEY V.O.
"Whether the Earth exists or not, whether we end up in Heaven, or Hell, or the cold vacuum of space, she has."
