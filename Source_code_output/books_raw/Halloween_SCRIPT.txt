OCTOBER 30

EXT. SMITH'S GROVE STATE HOSPITAL. DAY 
A cold brick building. Isolated. Surrounded on all sides by arbed-wire fencing. 
A RENTAL CAR pulls up to the SECURITY GATE. A SECURITY GUARD hecks the credentials of the driver. The Guard nods to the UARD BOOTH. The GATE OPENS. The rental car drives through. 

INT. SECURITY STATION. SMITH'S GROVE STATE HOSPITAL. DAY.
CLOSE ON: A HAND holding a MICROPHONE. The hand cranes the ike around the to pick up sounds of maniacal laughter choing from the corridor. 
INSERTS of the corresponding inspiration of these sounds.
REVEAL: DANA HAINES (30's), activating a TAPE RECORDER. She' ith AARON JOSEPH-KOREY (40); both scholarly, British. Aaro igns some documents at a CHECK-IN DESK. They look to eac ther. Aaron speaks into her microphone.
_DANA
"Check, check."
_AARON
"Testing, testing. One, two, three."
Among the SECURITY GUARDS, a NURSE works behind the securit esk of what looks to be a minimum security institution. Th urse places a needle on a record player. A joyous song fro  1930's musical plays.
Aaron looks through the security window and sees a DOCTO riting something down and speaking to a PATIENT and a guard UNEMAN. His ballpoint pen runs out of ink. He shakes it iscards it and then reaches into his lab coat pocket for  ore elegant pen to complete his prescription and signature e glances through the glass at his visitors.
Dana raises her mic to the door. WE HEAR SOUNDS throug arped distortion. THEN: A loud BUZZER snaps us back to eality as a ward activates the door lock.
CLOSE ON: The mechanics of the security locks, bars, etc.

A GREEN LIGHT FLASHES as the door opens and DR. RANBIR ARTAIN appears. A psychiatrist with a thick accent. 
_DR. SARTAIN
"Good afternoon. I'm Dr. Ranbir Sartain."
_DANA
"Thank you for taking the time to meet with us. We were hoping to have this chance before he is transferred to the new facility. Glass Hill is far less  accommodating."
_DR. SARTAIN
"Glass Hill is the pit of hell.  Underfunded and short staffed. For years he has been kept here to be studied. I suppose the state has lost interest in discovering anything further."
_AARON
"Well... That's why we're here."
_DANA
"Do you mind if I record this?"
_DR. SARTAIN
(A SMILE)
"Why not?"

INT. HALLWAY. SMITH'S GROVE STATE HOSPITAL. DAY.
A loud BUZZER as the door shuts. Sartain escorts Aaron an ana down a hall. Disturbed faces of PATIENTS pass. Man ehind bars, others with CLINICAL ESCORTS. Dana record artain as they walk.
_DANA
"How long have you been working with him?"
_DR. SARTAIN
"I've examined every case file written on him. I was a scholar of Dr. Loomis before he passed away. Then I lobbied the University of Illinois to be assign to Michael  myself."

_DANA
"Any progress?"
_DR. SARTAIN
"He has been seen by over 50 clinical psychiatrists. And with each, many different opinions. Loomis reasoned that he was nothing more than pure evil."
_DANA
"Any you agree with this diagnosis?"
_DR. SARTAIN
"Evil is not a diagnosis. Under my care, we implemented a holistic form of therapy. Since that time, his tendency for violence has essentially been erased."
_AARON
"His response to your specific treatment has been effective?"
_DR. SARTAIN
"We left two kitty cats in his cell overnight and both remained unharmed."
(A SMILE)
"I hate to disappoint you."
Aaron stop walking.
_AARON
"So you're telling us that there is no similarity between the murderous maniac that made newspaper headlines in"
and the amenabl patient of this institution? "
Sartain laughs.
_DR. SARTAIN
"Michael Myers is an evolving, aging creature like we all are. And although we have worked very closely with him, these halls display the limitations of my analysis. Loomis saw Michael as a  beast in the wild. He witnessed human behavior at its most primal, while the rest of us only have the opportunity of observation in captivity."

Sartain uses a key to open a heavy door that leads into...

EXT. COURTYARD. SMITH'S GROVE STATE HOSPITAL. DAY.
Sartain walks them into an outside courtyard. A fe ISFIGURED or DISABLED RESIDENTS roam about. 
_DR. SARTAIN
"Our patients get fresh air and sunshine, a view, proper exercise, a healthy diet. It pains me to see  him transferred to a less than  desirable' facility."
(POINTING)
"There he is. He can speak. He just chooses not to."
Aaron and Dana look. WE FIND THE SHAPE OF A MAN sixty fee way standing shackled to the ground in the middle of th oncrete yard. A YELLOW PAINTED SQUARE creates a twenty foo rame around him. Tall, strong, aged, dressed in white.
TWO SECURITY OFFICERS stand watch. SIX OTHER PATIENTS stan cattered through the yard.
_AARON
"I'd love to stand near him and get a sense of his awareness... Or lack of awareness."
_DR. SARTAIN
"Make no mistake. He is aware. He was watching you as you arrived. When he's not out here in the courtyard, he walks from this window to that window, to the other. Observing things."
Aaron and Dana look curiously to each other.
_DR. SARTAIN (CONT'D)
(TO AARON)
"And perhaps you'd like to tie your left shoelace. Mr Tovoli, the gentleman with the umbrella, has a fixation for such things. Underestimate no one."
A patient holding AN UMBRELLA in the sunshine bites  ingernail and smiles at them. Embarrassed, Aaron bends dow o tie his clean white sneaker.

_DR. SARTAIN (CONT'D)
"Step up to the yellow line. No further. Do not pass the line under any circumstance."
Sartain looks to the security guards for reassurance and the alks Aaron and Dana to the yellow line on the concrete.
The Shape stands with his back to them. Sartain calls out:
_DR. SARTAIN (CONT'D)
"Michael. I have some people who would like to meet you."
Aaron clears his throat.
_AARON
"Michael. My name be Aaron. I've followed your case for years, and I still know very little about you. I want to know more about that night.  About those involved."
The Shape is motionless.
_AARON (CONT'D)
"Do you think of them? Feel guilt about their fate?"
Nothing.
Aaron looks back to Dana with a shrug. She hesitantly steps orward to join her partner.
_AARON (CONT'D)
"Do you remember Laurie Strode?"
The Shape stretches his fingers and then rests his hand a is side. Sartain notices.
_AARON (CONT'D)
"Does she remind you of your sister, Michael? Is that why you chose her?"
The Shape half turns, as if he's going to respond... but the oesn't.
Aaron looks back to Sartain. He nods to Aaron to go ahead aron looks to Dana. She unzips her bag. 

_AARON (CONT'D)
"I borrowed something from a friend at the Attorney General's office. Something I'd like you to see."
Aaron's hand goes inside Dana's shoulder bag and pulls out  ortion of a WHITE HALLOWEEN MASK. Familiar.
Sartain looks to see this exchange. Aaron holds the mask ou efore him. The Shape makes no movement. The other patients ecome restless. Pacing madly. Dana looks around, concerned. aron doesn't lower the mask.
_AARON (CONT'D)
"You recognize this, don't you, Michael? How does it make you feel? Say something."
A few of the patients start screaming. Testing thei estraints like rabid animals.
Dana looks to Sartain. He is concerned.
More patients join in, stomping and screaming, getting loude nd louder.
Aaron shouts back to The Shape. 
_AARON (CONT'D)
"Say SOMETHING!"
The courtyard has been worked into a frenzied chorus o adness, but The Shape remains still.

_SHANAH
"I rescheduled my last session, so I'll be able to make it tonight."
_ALLYSON
"You didn't have to do that. It's not that big of a deal. "

"Of course it is. You got into National Honor Society. It's a very big deal."
(BEAT)
"I was top of my shop class, made ashtrays and birdhouses."
Ray loads up another mouse trap.
_SHANAH
"And I'm looking forward to meeting Cameron."
_RAY
"I know his father Lonnie and his uncle James. The entire Elam family  has a... reputation."
_SHANAH
(shoots a look)
"Ray, c'mon."
_RAY
"What?! You know about his situation, right? It's a relevant factor. The whole household is--"
The mouse trap snaps in Ray's hand, smashing his finger. Ray umps, startled. His finger bleeds.
_RAY (CONT'D)
"Goddamn it!"
_ALLYSON
(LAUGHING)
"That's not fair, dad. Cameron isn't  like that. He's a nice guy"
Ray walks to the sink to wash his finger.
_RAY
"I'm not saying he's not nice. It's just- You're too smart to go out with troublemakers and dip shits."
_ALLYSON
"You're right."
(BEAT)
"Did you guys invite Grandmother like you said you would?"
Shanah looks to Ray. They make eyes.

_SHANAH
"I did. Talked to her yesterday. She's not going to be able to make it."
Allyson zips up her back-pack and give her mom a look.
_ALLYSON
"Really?"
Ray kisses his hurt finger and gives Shanah a nervous look.
_SHANAH
"She's agoraphobic. In serious need of cognitive... Um... behavioral-"
A buzzer RINGS.

"Vicky's here. I gotta go."
Ray turns off the sink and stare awkwardly at his wife.

It EXPLODES as they run away.

EXT. MAKE-SHIFT SHOOTING RANGE. LAURIE'S PROPERTY. DAY. 
GROUPED SHOTS strike WITH PRECISION in THE HEART OF A TARGET.
Holding a smoking gun, years of anxiety cut through a eautiful face. The dark circles under the eyes show a lif illed with lidless nights. This is LAURIE STRODE (57), for etter or worse.
She's surrounded by wilderness except for the sack with arrels and targets and department store mannequins.

She sets the gun down, pulls a bottle of pills out of he ocket and taps one into her mug of coffee. She drinks, wipes er mouth, picks up a different gun. A high power semi utomatic weapon.
She fires at the staged mannequins. Their heads and bodie rupt into shrapnel.

EXT. FARM HOUSE. LAURIE'S PROPERTY. DAY.
Laurie drives an ATV. It rolls to the farm house with a fla ire. She comes to a stop to examine the issue.
We notice that the downstairs windows have bars covering u he glass for security. Wind chimes give a tranquil feel to he fortified compound.

INT. FARM HOUSE. LIVING ROOM. DAY
A SERIES OF SHOTS: Laurie disassembles and cleans he irearms like a pro. She wears a tank top that reveals a sca cross her shoulder.

EXT. COUNTRY ROAD. DAY
A rental car drives down a road through an isolated fores nd pulls up to a gate.

I./E. RENTAL CAR. DAY
Aaron speaks into a recorder as he drives. Dana holds a map.
_DANA
"What is it we're after?"
_AARON
"To see the animal inside its environment. I fear there has been no rehabilitation. In this case it seems one monster created another. A victim locks herself away. Imprisoned by her own fear. Our goal is to get them in a room together. Can we find a form of rehabilitation if she faces him again?"
_DANA
"Here we are."

Aaron and Dana stop the car and look to an intercom next t n overflowing mail box.
_DANA (CONT'D)
"You might want this."
She holds out an envelope of cash.
_AARON
"Journalists don't pay for interviews, Dana. This is her fifteen minutes of fame. There are two people in this world that care about her and they're both in this car."
_DANA
(noting her file)
"She's financially unstable. Had every job you can think of for the last forty years from catering to cosmetology. Currently unemployed."

INT. LAURIE'S HOUSE. DAY.
Dirty dishes are overflowing in the kitchen. The rest of he ome isn't much better. Books and supplies stacked ever here.
Laurie cleans a Smith and Wesson revolver. She opens th ylinder and see a SINGLE fastball inside. She takes out th ullet and considers it. She puts it back and spins th ylinder. Engaged. She cocks the hammer. 
A BUZZ startles her. Laurie eyeballs four black and whit ecurity camera monitors. She looks to the arrival of he ninvited guests.

EXT. GATE ENTRANCE. LAURIE'S PROPERTY. DAY
A SPEAKER hisses to life.
_LAURIE (O.S.)
"Can I help you?"
Aaron struggles to reach the "press to speak" button. It' oo far so he opens his door just a bit.
_AARON
"Yes. We're looking for Laurie Strode."

_LAURIE (O.S.)
"Who?"
_AARON
"My name is Aaron Joseph Korey and- Um... We're working on a um... on a podcast."
_LAURIE (O.S.)
"Good for you."
_DANA
(LEANING OVER)
"We're investigative journalists."
_AARON
"If you have a moment. We've travelled a long way to speak with you."
No response.
_AARON (CONT'D)
"We'll pay you for your time."
Still nothing. Dana hands Aaron AN ORANGE ENVELOPE.
_DANA
"How does three thousand dollars sound?"
After a pause, the gate buzzes open. Dana gives Aaron a loo s they drive through the gate.

INT. LAURIE'S HOUSE. DAY.
Laurie, Aaron and Dana are seated. Dana presses record on he ecording device.
_DANA
"You've lived here since"
_LAURIE
"Sounds about right."
_DANA
(LOOKS AROUND)
"Do you feel isolated?"
_LAURIE
"I don't."

_AARON
"You tell yourself that you're protecting your family. That if he come for you again you've distanced yourself from everyone that you love."
Laurie doesn't respond. An awkward moment. Dana nods at Aaron nd steps in.
_DANA
"Aaron and I have made several award winning public radio exposes. Our last project shed fresh light on a murder case from twenty years ago. We like to re-examine incidents with an unbiased lens. When people are willing to face a thing in a different light over time, new truths can sometimes emerge. I believe there is a lot to learn from the horror you experienced."
_LAURIE
"There's nothing to re-examine. Nothing to learn from something that happened forty years ago."
_AARON
"So is he real?"
_LAURIE
"Who?"
_AARON
"The Boogeyman. I've read you"
_QUOATED-
_LAURIE
"You don't believe in The Boogeyman?"
_AARON
"I believe in Michael Myers, a deranged serial killer. But The Boogeyman?"
_LAURIE
"Well, you should."
_AARON
"We have archival recordings of Dr. Loomis from after that horrific night."
_AARON (CONT'D)
"His intellect was overcome with abstract and apocalyptic observations."
_LAURIE
"He just wanted Michael dead and no one would listen."
_DANA
"Michael Myers is a human being that killed his sister when he was six years old. And then he came after  you... We want to know why. We want a glimpse inside his mind. That's why your story be important."
_LAURIE
"My story?"
_AARON
"Two failed marriages. A rocky family relationship with your daughter and grandaughter. Among other issues..."
_DANA
"Aaron!"
Aaron nods to a few empty pill bottles strewn about.
_LAURIE
"It's interesting that Michael killed five people and he's a human being. I'm twice divorced and I'm a  basket case."
_AARON
(HESITANTLY)
"My apologies."
Laurie gets up and scavenges aimlessly.
_LAURIE
"I have nothing but vague, very blemished memories of that night. The insight you're here for does not exist."
Aaron nods.
_AARON
"They're transferring him."

_LAURIE
"I know. Tomorrow."
_DANA
"He'll be locked away till the end of his days."
_LAURIE
"That's the idea."
_AARON
"Do you surrender any efforts of rehabilitation?"
_LAURIE
"-Because everyone knows 40 years is when you typically turn the corner."
Dana switches gears.
_DANA
"Let's talk about when the state came to take your daughter away. She was twelve years old. They said you were unfit mother. How long until you regained custody?"
_LAURIE
"I didn't. But I bet you know that."
Laurie looks out the front door window to the outside. etting lost in it.
_AARON
"Mrs Strode. We want you to sit down with him. Sit with Michael in a safe environment. He won't talk to anybody... But he might speak to you. Finally you can get the chance to say what you've always wanted to say to him. Come with us. Let us  help you free yourself."
_LAURIE
"Time's up. I'll accept my payment."
Aaron pull the orange envelope out. He take it to her. Sh ounts it, then opens the front door and looks to the trees.
_LAURIE (CONT'D)
"With your journalistic insights, I'm sure you'll be able to find your way out."

We dawdle on Laurie in a moment of contemplation.

INT. HALLWAY. HIGH SCHOOL. MORNING.
THE BELL RINGS. Allyson closes her locker with a handful o ooks and turns to be startled by a figure standing behind er. We reveal CAMERON ELAM (17).
_CAMERON
(DISGUISED VOICE)
"Gottcha!"
Allyson drops her books.
_ALLYSON
"Cameron. Jesus."
Cameron helps her pick up her books.
_CAMERON
"I got you, babe. Do you have  everything for your costume tomorrow night? Bonnie and Clyde must roll as one."
_ALLYSON
"I'm just thinking about tonight."
_CAMERON
"Tonight? Come on. I thought you were joking when you said your parents were old fashioned."
_ALLYSON
"Be nice. It'll be nice. I just want you to meet them. I'm more old fashioned than they are. Just don't make them like you too much. I like to keep them on edge."
She grin and gives him a kiss. CLOSE ON THE KISS.
_OSCAR (O.S.)
"Slow down, Smoochy. Give me a  slice."
Cameron and Allyson pull apart to reveal OSCAR (17) a fast- alking slime ball with charm. He gives them each a kiss o he cheek.
_CAMERON
"Dude, you got your chapped lip crusties all over me, man."

_OSCAR
"You have everything for your  costume tomorrow night? Tango and Cash must roll as one."
Oscar puts on Chap Stick.
_CAMERON
"Um..."
_OSCAR
"What? You said we were going as Sly and Kurt, bro. You said we were  doing this Halloween dance thing. What's up? You're ditching me now?"
Oscar gets Cameron in a headlock and drives him into the all. Allyson rolls her eyes. 
_ALLYSON
"I'll see you lovebirds later."
(TO CAMERON)
"And I well see you tonight."
She walks off shaking her head with a smile. A girl, KIM ives her a funny look from across the hall. 

INT. COMMUNITY CENTER. DAY.
CLOSE ON Shanah. She leads a discussion for A GROUP OF AT ISK CHILDREN (ages 7-10) that sit with their heads on  able in a counseling session. Each have HOME MADE puppet hat speak their emotions. One kid tries to untangle a YO-YO.
_CHILD #
"I'm Bradley and I get angry at the rain."
_CHILD #2
"When my brother comes home from school I get scared cuz he brings the guys to fight and throw people through walls."
Child #3 puts her marionette down and raises her head.
_CHILD #3
"If you run away from home then you have no one to hurt you."
 20.

_SHANAH
"We need to look at those who love us for protection and comfort but listen to our feelings. We all have lived through difficult situations and are confronted with bad people from time to time, but by using our voice we can overcome  our problems."

EXT. COMMUNITY CENTER. DAY.
It's a facility in a run-down neighborhood. MIDDLE AG OMMUNITY MEMBERS play basketball as kids from Shanah' herapy load onto a VAN ushered away by her assistant. 
Laurie pulls up in her small pick-up truck.

INT. COMMUNITY CENTER. DAY.
Shanah stands in her office watching a CHATTERING TOOTH TO n her desk as she packs up her files. 
_LAURIE (O.S.)
"Shanah. I need to talk to you."
Shanah takes a final sip off coffee and glances up. No xpecting to see Laurie.
_SHANAH
"Well hello mother. New glasses?"
_LAURIE
"Allyson reached out to me-"
_SHANAH
"I specifically told you you're not to have any communication with her."
_LAURIE
"I can't control who calls me. She's her own person and she's making her own decisions."
_SHANAH
"What did she reach out to you about?"
_LAURIE
"Joining you tonight. "

_SHANAH
"Interesting. I guess she hasn't picked up on the fact that you... raised me."
_LAURIE
"I raised you the way I did for your own protection and you're telling me I ruined your life?"
(BEAT)
"As a mental health care professional, I would hope you could empathize in some way."
Shanah leaves her office with an empty coffee mug.
_SHANAH (O.S.)
"I've heard this before."
Laurie sinks.

INT. COMMUNITY CENTER. OFFICE KITCHEN. CONTINUOUS.
Shanah puts her mug in the dishwasher.
Laurie appears, holding the yo-yo the kid was trying to ntangle. She untangles it to deflect herself from th ssues.
_LAURIE
"Michael Myers is leaving Smith Grove. I've spent years petitioning for his transfer. He'll spend the rest of his life at a prison in Colorado. I'm going to do what I can to put my past behind me. It's been forty years. I just wanted to come here today and tell you that."
She takes a moment in attempt to connect.
_SHANAH
"I'm happy that you're ready to put your past behind you, but I've got to figure out if I can put our past behind me."
Laurie turns to leave. Shanah switch gears.
_SHANAH (CONT'D)
"Mom, wait."
(BEAT)
_SHANAH (CONT'D)
"Allyson is being rewarded at school  tonight and then we're going to have a family dinner after. It's important to her. She wants you to come. So..."
(BEAT)
"I think you should come."
The two strong woman stand in hopeful silence.

INTERCUT WITH...

INT. CELL. SMITH'S GROVE STATE HOSPITAL. NIGHT

_HASKELL
"Hands on the wall!"
Kuneman reads more names from a check-list:

"hands in self-defense. He continued stabbing into the arteries and nerves of her palms, like so..."
(points to palms)
"Once she collapsed, three more stabs in her sternum, piercing her  heart."
The caretaker looks put off by the vivid story.
_CARETAKER
"I don't know about sternums. All I know is we've had to replace this stone two times, people come around and put demon pentagrams and voodoo shit on it. Every Halloween. Crazy coconuts."

"Still waiting to ID the patients we found to see who's who. Almost all accounted for. Found two of them trying to check their e-mail at the local library and three others holding hands and chasing butterflies by the flea market off 220. Any word from Rip van Winkle over there?"
The Sheriff sip his coffee.
_OFFICER HAWKINS
"Not yet. The nurses say he's been in and out. Lost a lot of blood. Somehow managed to fall on a bullet. I'm trying to get the story. Because here's my concern: Take a look at this list."

It's forty years t the day. You think this is a coincidence or part of some greater plan?"
The Sheriff looks at Sartain laying there.
_SHERIFF BARKER
"Look Frank, I don't need to incite panic until we have all the facts. Myers loose with a bunch of nutbags in Haddonfield on Halloween night is a fucking joke if it's not legit. It sounds like a joke. It would ruin our department. And if it is legit. If Myers did escape, we're gonna have a serious circus on our hands."

_VICKY
"Look, I wouldn't bail on you, but I need some cash, so I said I would. You'll have fun. I promise."
_DAVE
"Vicky's also gonna have some fun. She said if I behave, I can come over after the kid's nighty night and do cool stuff. Like clean dishes, mop up, keep her company."
_VICKY
"You're like my helpful pet. I appreciate you, Dave. If you help me mop and do dishes I'll take your virginity. Enough of this third base shit, right? We're adults."

Allyson walks up. Oscar sees the CHEERLEADERS drive by agai n the other side of the lot.
_OSCAR
"Hey Allyson. Guess what? Cameron  likes you more than me, but I'm over it. I'll see you guys later. I'm gonna catch up with Bianca and  see if any of those ladies need a handsome male escort to Halloween."
Cameron and Allyson shrug and Oscar races off on a mission.
_CAMERON
"He's a mess."
(turns to Allyson)
"You okay?"

_ALLYSON
"I'm fine. I couldn't sleep. I was so embarrassed about last night. I'm sorry you had to see that. It's a weird time for me I guess."

_DETECTIVE
"State issued."
_SHERIFF BARKER
"Get on the phone to Smith's Grove and confirm the match."
_OFFICER HAWKINS
"In the meantime, we have to let people know, Sir."
_SHERIFF BARKER
"Not until we have confirmation. I don't want the media foaming at the mouth and dragging the name of this town through the headlines again."
_OFFICER HAWKINS
"I strongly disagree, sir. If this is who we think it is, we have one order of business. Hunt this man down."
Hawkins looks to where Laurie was. She's gone.

"Allyson? Anyone home?"

She puts the food down on the kitchen counter and notice hat all of her knives are spread out along the counter as i n display.
She hears something upstairs. A noise that could be the hous ettling or it could be something more.
She begins walking toward the steps slowly.

"Shanah?"
Shanah turns and motions for him to be silent.

_LAURIE
"Bang. You're dead."
Shanah gasps.
_SHANAH
"You scared the shit out of me. What are you doing in my house?!"
_LAURIE
"Side window is unlocked. No security system. You have a dozen knives available for any psychotic to come in here and stab you with. Sometimes I can't tell the difference between ignorance and stupidity."
_RAY
"I know Jujitsu, Laurie. I can apply pressure points and choke holds to use the opponents force of attack against them."
_SHANAH/LAURIE
"Shut up, Ray."
Laurie walks down the stairs.
_LAURIE
"Michael has escaped. I'd be a fool to think this is over. If he comes for my family, I'll be ready."

"Where's Allyson? We have to get out of here. Now."
_SHANAH
"Mom, no one's coming after you and they're not coming after us. Get out of my way."

_LAURIE
(THINKING)
 'Out of my way'. It's like I'm
"always in your way, aren't I, Shanah? You're always going somewhere and you're trying to leave me behind. Evil is real. You don't know what it's like to feel true terror. To live powerless. I don't ever want you to feel that way. I only want to train and protect you."
_SHANAH
"The world is not a dark place. It can be full of love and understanding and I don't need your psychotic rants to confuse me or convince me otherwise."
_RAY
"You need to leave, Laurie."
Laurie looks at both of them from the front porch and pauses.

_SHERIFF BARKER

_DR. SARTAIN
"I tried to hide, but he found me. Locked me to a seat. He looked down at me. I closed my eyes and when I opened them, he walked away."

_DR. SARTAIN (CONT'D)
"He lawfully stood between doctor Loomis' vindictive tirade and the right to a fair trial."
_LAURIE
"Loomis calling for his execution didn't persuade you?"

Allyson can't believe it.
_CAMERON
"Are you serious? Are you fucking serious?!! Allyson!"

Cameron looks to Allyson only she's pissed and turns away ameron looks to Oscar.
_OFFICER #2
"Who's the little bitch now?"
_CAMERON
"Oscar! Get her home safe, man."
_OFFICER #
"Party's over!"
_CAMERON
"Get her home!"
Oscar and Allyson take off through the bleachers.

INT. NELSON HOUSE. NIGHT
Shanah opens the door and finds Laurie.
_SHANAH
"Mom! Do we have to do this-"
Shanah notices FOUR POLICE OFFICERS in the street behind her.
_LAURIE
"I never wanted you to be scared, baby. Never. Just prepared."
Laurie takes her hand.
_LAURIE (CONT'D)
"Where's Allyson?"
Shanah throws her mother a look of concern.
_LAURIE (CONT'D)
"Where's Allyson?!"

INT. NELSON HOUSE. LIVING ROOM. MOMENTS LATER.
Shanah on the phone:
_SHANAH
(INTO PHONE)
"Allyson, you need to call me the second you get this. The police said the dance was evacuated and I haven't heard from you. We're heading to your Grandmother's house. We're worried about you."

Shanah hands the phone to Laurie to speak:
_LAURIE
(INTO PHONE)
"Where are you, baby? There are police officers at your house. Get to them and they'll bring you to us. We're all together now. We love you..."
Her dialog bleeds over image of the next scene.

EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD. NIGHT.
Oscar and Allyson walk down the sidewalk. Oscar carries  ase of beer.
_LAURIE (O.S.)
"Wherever you are... It's not safe outside tonight."
_OSCAR
"This is an amazing night, right?! Don't you just love Cameron?"
_ALLYSON
"No. I think he's a jerk."
_OSCAR
"He's cool. So bad ass. But I can tell you're pissed about your phone. He plopped it into the chili con queso."
(BEAMING)
"Classic Cameron!"
_ALLYSON
"I'm tired of people letting me down. You give them the benefit of the doubt and think they're going to be different, but then they show you who they truly are. Cameron doesn't want people to judge him, but then he acts like a jerk. Gets drunk, gets arrested."
Oscar stops. She turns.
_OSCAR
"You deserve better. You're the smartest, most beautiful girl at school. Anyone that doesn't appreciate that is crazy."

She considers this and smiles.
_ALLYSON
"Thanks Oscar, that's sweet."
_OSCAR
"Check it out. 5.0. Let's detour this rendezvous."
HAWKINS' SQUAD CAR drives by just as Allyson and Oscar cu etween two houses.

INT. HAWKINS' SQUAD CAR (MOVING). NIGHT.
Hawkins is patrolling the streets. Dr. Sartain rides shotgu nd holds a spotlight scanning for signs of Myers.
_OFFICER HAWKINS
"From a clinical perspective, would you say that Laurie Strode has lost her fucking marbles?"
_DR. SARTAIN
"There are many ways for tragedy to change a victim. They can grow accustomed to always being afraid. They can become weak or they can become strong. But there is also the other side."
_OFFICER HAWKINS
"What side is that?"
_DR. SARTAIN
"The core of the victimizer. This is  what has intrigued me through my studies. How does a crime like Michael's change him? What is he feeling? Is he on a random path or is he emotionally driven? Triggered by something. Some unheard marching  order imprinted on his very being? Evil incarnate. Michael and I had a special connection, but without his verbal participation there was a side of his mad journey that I could never understand."
_OFFICER HAWKINS
"Walk a mile in another man's shoes, or something like that, right? Not for me, brother."

_DR. SARTAIN
"Tell me what become of his childhood home."
_OFFICER HAWKINS
"That old place was a shrine kinda- thing but for serial killer groupies and death metal bands. Vandals got the best of it. A local organization that I work with tore it down and turned it into a community garden. Turned tragedy into beauty if you can consider it."

EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD. BACKYARD. NIGHT.
Oscar jumps over the BLACK IRON FENCE into a backyard. H wkwardly handles his beer. He sets it down and looks around n the moonlight, he makes out the fence way at the opposite nd. Allyson climbs up to cross over.
_OSCAR
"Watch out for the poison ivy. It's all over."
_ALLYSON
"This is a dumb short cut."
_OSCAR
"Treacherous. Let me give you a hand."
Oscar reaches up to help her down from the fence. She almos lips. He catches her and lowers her down safely.
_ALLYSON
"Thanks."
He doesn't let go. He grins at her.
_ALLYSON (CONT'D)
"What? What are you doing?"
_OSCAR
"You deserve better."
He awkwardly leans in to kiss her on the lips.
_ALLYSON
"Ew. Oscar. What the fuck?!"
She pushes him off. Oscar realizes what just happened.

_OSCAR
"Wait, I thought you said you weren't with Cameron anymore."
_ALLYSON
"Doesn't mean I want- Get away from me."
_OSCAR
"I thought you were sending me signals."
_ALLYSON
"Definitely no signals. Just go!"
She walks off into the darkness of the yard. He follow esperately.
_OSCAR
(EMBARRASSED)
"I'm sorry. Please don't tell  Cameron I did that. I didn't feel anything either."
She stops and turns to face him.
_ALLYSON
"You're disgusting. I'm going home. You need to figure your shit out."
She walks off. Leaves him standing there.
A MOTION sensor LIGHT is activated, turning on a BRIGHT YAR IGHT.
_OSCAR
(TO HIMSELF)
"I'm drunk. Like... really drunk, and I got all horny at the party, I was dancing with some girl, this way out of my league girl and my brain got all sexed up, and her tits got me totally chubbed out when she was feeding me guacamole in sexy ways--"
Oscar drops his case of beer. One of them sprays.
_OSCAR (CONT'D)
"SHIT!"
Cans roll out. He scrambles to pick them up. He looks up an ees the Shape standing twenty feet away.

_OSCAR (CONT'D)
"Happy Halloween, Mr. Elrod. Cool mask. Sorry... I'm not trying to trespass on your shit, I was just talking to this pretty girl over there. It's just... I guess, I always kind of liked her. And I know she's bummed out about Cameron so I thought maybe... Stupid,  right?"
The Shape stands. No response.
_OSCAR (CONT'D)
"All right. Peace. Thank you."
THE LIGHT GOES OUT.
AT THE FAR SIDE OF THE YARD, Allyson makes it to the six foo LACK IRON FENCE and starts to climb. She grabs one of the harp metal spikes that jut from the top and pulls her hand t's slightly precarious but she's careful to avoid the iro pikes as she climbs over. She drops to the other side an alks down an alley. Disappointed.
ON OSCAR as THE LIGHT COMES BACK ON.
Oscar looks around and sees no one.
_OSCAR (CONT'D)
"Yo! Where'd you go, bro? You're acting super sketchy right now."
He's confused and looks over his shoulder as he walks agai o cross the yard. He runs straight into THE SHAPE and gasps.
He drops his beer as A KNIFE RAISES. Oscar put his arm up.
THE LIGHT TURNS OFF. TOTAL BLACKNESS.
ON ALLYSON DOWN THE STREET as she hear A SCREAM. She stops ooks back.
THE LIGHTS TURN BACK ON.
Oscar runs as fast as he can. He's bleeding from his forearm.
The Shape walks behind him.
Oscar gets to the fence and leaps for the top bar. He gets alfway over and snags his cape.
Oscar sees The Shape drawing closer with his knife raised. H tabs Oscar in the back and grabs at his feet.

Oscar struggles to hang on as he SCREAMS.
THE LIGHTS TURN OFF.
We faintly see Oscar as he loses the battle. His jaw get mpaled by the sharp iron spike of the fence. 
TOTAL BLACKNESS.
ON ALLYSON as she walkway cautiously toward the scream.
_AARON
"Oscar?!! Oscar?!"
In the darkness, she arrives at the fence.
THE LIGHTS COME BACK ON.
SHE SEES OSCAR. His face has been pierced from the chi hrough his mouth by one of the iron spikes at the top of the ence. He chokes and gags, gargling blood.
Allyson starts to hyperventilate and turns her head to se he yard. For a split second she sees The Shape standing O ER SIDE of the fence, holding a knife.
THE LIGHTS GO OFF. She screams and runs like hell.
Allyson runs faster than she's ever run before... Out of th arkness into the open neighborhood.

EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD. NIGHT.
EXTREME WIDE SHOT OF THE STREET. Allyson looks to a hous hat has a light on inside. She runs up to the porch an ounds her fists desperately on the door.
_ALLYSON
"Help me!! Open the door!"
Another light switches on in a window.
_ALLYSON (CONT'D)
"Please open the door! "
EXTREME CLOSE-UP as Allyson bangs on the door. A face APPEAR n a window.

INT. POLICE CRUISER. (MOVING) NIGHT.
Laurie, Shanah and Ray ride in back. Officer Richards drives fficer Francis sits in the front passenger seat. 

Shanah's phone rings, "Unknown Caller".
_SHANAH
"Hello? - Allyson? - Thank God you're all right. Where are you?!"
Laurie looks at her reflection in the window as Shana istens to Allyson's story.

EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD. NIGHT.
Breathing. A POV hangs behind a tree. Looks left and right tarts walking. Looks left.
Hawkins' vehicle appears suddenly and drives past fast.

EXT. NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE. NIGHT
Hawkins pulls up as Allyson stands with a crowd of NEIGHBORS he runs to him as he steps out of his car.
_ALLYSON
"Officer! I saw him. My friend was attacked! He came out of nowhere-"
Allyson breathes heavily. Hawkins comforts her.
_OFFICER HAWKINS
"Take a deep breath, Allyson. You're going to be all right. Take a deep breath."

EXT. RURAL ROAD. LAURIE'S HOUSE. NIGHT.
The squad car pulls up to Laurie's gate. A HARSH overhea POTLIGHT let's us know where we are. Laurie types in  assword and the security GATE OPENS.
_OFFICER FRANCIS
"We'll drop you off and wait at the gate for your girl to arrive. We have an officer on the scene in contact with her now."
They enter.

INT. LAURIE'S HOUSE. NIGHT.
Several locks and reinforcements detach as Laurie, Shanah an ay step into Laurie's home.

Shanah looks around the familiar house. It's been a while.
Ray and Shanah explore the various details of the interior he fireplace has been sealed off with concrete, dead-bol ocks on interior doors, windows with security bars.
_RAY
"Home is where the heart is, right  Laurie?"
Laurie stares at him. Ray points to a dead rat in a vicious ooking trap.
_LAURIE
"I saw your mousetraps, Ray. Peanut butter and marshmallow fluff?"
Shanah takes a pensive moment before she twists the kitche sland counter-clockwise and lifts the door to th nderground shelter. Ray looks curious.
_RAY
"What's this?"
_SHANAH
"My childhood."
_LAURIE
"It's how we protect ourselves."
Shanah disappears down the ladder. The light from withi urns on. Laurie and Ray approach and look down.
INSIDE THE SHELTER:
They see a woman prepared. Food. Water. Weapons. A bed. I ontrast to the rest of the house, it's a clean and organize llustration of Laurie's fears.
Shanah climbs down the ladder and feels the wave of he roubled youth wash over her.
Laurie and Ray come down behind her. Laurie types in a assword, "103178" and reveals a gun cabinet full of weapons. 
_LAURIE (CONT'D)
"Pick your poison. Do you need small caliber defense, semi-automatic ballistics with brownout rounds, a shotgun for tactical operations or  a rifle with accuracy and stopping power?"
They look at Laurie's confidence. Or is she coming unglued? 
 80.

_LAURIE (CONT'D)
"He's waited for this night. He's waited for me. I've been waiting for him."

INT. HAWKINS' SQUAD CAR (MOVING). NIGHT.

(THROUGH RADIO)
"Copy 601. Be advised. Suspect last reported on 11th Avenue, South of Bypass."
_ALLYSON
"I haven't been to her house in years, but I think I can give you directions from the-"
Allyson's eye strain. She POINTS AND SCREAMS:
_ALLYSON (CONT'D)
"LOOK OUT!!"
Hawkins turns and see SOMEONE walk in front of his car.
_OFFICER HAWKINS
(CALMLY)
"Brace yourself."
He presses the gas and swerves to hit The Shape. Nails him. nocks him to the concrete.

_OFFICER HAWKINS (CONT'D)
"Stay in the car!"

EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD. CONTINUOUS.
Sartain and Hawkins get out. Hawkins has his gun drawn as h pproaches The Shape.
Allyson watches from inside.

Sartain steps up cautiously from behind Hawkins, passes hi nd examines The Shape, feeling the pulse on his neck. 
_DR. SARTAIN
"He's alive."
Hawkins raises his gun.
_OFFICER HAWKINS
"Not for long. Stand back."
_DR. SARTAIN
"Officer Hawkins, do not kill my patient."
_OFFICER HAWKINS
"I'm finishing this. "
Hawkins takes aim on The Shape. Sartain stands in his way.
_OFFICER HAWKINS (CONT'D)
"Get back, now. I'm going to fire! "
Sartain takes a deep breath and pull his pen from his pocket e clicks it nervously.
_OFFICER HAWKINS (CONT'D)
"I'm not going to ask you again, Doctor. Stand back!"
Sartain slides the clip of his pen to the side. The ink poin etracts, and A SHARP, TWO-INCH BLADE flicks out.
Sartain grips the blade, turns around, quickly grabs Hawkin un hand and stabs the steel straight into Hawkins' neck!
THE GUN GOES OFF AND DROPS.
Sartain sharply slashes his throat.
Allyson's eyes go wide. She can't believe what she's seeing.
Sartain inhales the feeling of his kill. He pulls the pen ou f Hawkins's neck, and we REVEAL: A long bloody BLADE-- CLIC - the blade retracts.
Hawkins drops.
Sartain turns to Allyson looking at him from the car. He peaks calmly.
_DR. SARTAIN
"Don't move, Young lady. Do not scream. Stay where you are."

INT. HAWKINS' SQUAD CAR. CONTINUOUS.
FROM THE BACK OF THE CAR, Allyson watches Sartain through th arrier. She scrambles to get out door. Locked. She see artain smiling at her. Then he BENDS down OUT OF SIGHT.

EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD. CONTINUOUS.
Sartain squats, looking at his patient passed out. The Shap s motionless. Sartain puts a knee on The Shape's chest...
INT. HAWKINS' SQUAD CAR. CONTINUOUS.
Allyson sees him stand back up at the hood of the car artain is wearing THE MASK.
Allyson huddles down, SCREAMING.
Sartain screams in the mask with her, banging on the hood o he car.
Allyson SCREAMS, trapped in the backseat.
Sartain stops moving. He stands still looking at Allyson ilent.
Allyson is crying now. Pleading:
_ALLYSON
"Please... Don't."
Sartain walks up to her window. He stares at Allyson an akes a "shush" finger on the mask, then walks over to Th hape.
_DR. SARTAIN
(WHISPERS)
"This is a dream."
Allyson watches out the window. She panics.
_ALLYSON
"No! please no! Please!"
Sartain awkwardly lifts the unconscious Shape into the bac eat with Allyson. He struggles with the pain of his wounde rm . His body slumps over leaning on her. She sees TH HAPE'S greasy hair touch her.
_DR. SARTAIN
"Make room, my dear. Mindful of my patient."
(to The Shape)
_DR. SARTAIN (CONT'D)
"Are you with us, Michael? Are you listening?"
(TO ALLYSON)
"I don't believe he hears everything."
Allyson pushes The Shape off of her.
Sartain takes off THE MASK and throws it in. It lands on th eat between her and The Shape. He closes the door.

She frantically tries to open her door. Sartain get in th ront seat and drives off.

INT. HAWKINS' SQUAD CAR (MOVING). NIGHT.
IN BACK, Allyson cowers against the door opposite The Shape is face is shrouded in shadow, lit briefly as they pas nder street lamps.
Allyson whimpers as The Shape jostles in his seat. He slowl tarts SLIDING DOWN TOWARDS HER. She uses her feet to pus is body away and back onto his side.
She crawls against the door watching The Shape.
_DR. SARTAIN
"Michael, I see why you are who you are. The sensation is obvious. The thrill is exhilarating. Loomis was a coward. He was afraid to travel to such depths for you. But I love you and I know you feel the same way. I freed you from those unwilling to understand you. Those of archaic mind."
Allyson is desperate.
_ALLYSON
(weeping to herself)
"Let me go. Please."
_DR. SARTAIN
"The look on your face when you saw  freedom? And then the carnage and confusion we created? "

She looks at Sartain's eyes in the rearview mirror watchin er, cold, calculating, perverse. She looks down at THE MAS itting on the seat between her and The Shape.
_DR. SARTAIN (CONT'D)
"I'm glad we're together, Michael."
Allyson wipes her eyes.
_ALLYSON
(DESPERATE)
"Please... Where are you taking me?!"
Sartain chuckles and keeps driving.
Allyson looks back down. POV: the seat is empty-- NO MASK.
PAN UP FROM THE SEAT:
THE SHAPE IS WEARING THE MASK LOOKING AT HER! 
Before she can scream, The Shape grabs Allyson's hair an hrows her into the passenger side door.
He scoots back and lifts his leg; KICKS HIS WINDOW WITH HI OOT.
The car starts to swerve out of control as he fractures th lass.
The car jerks right and Allyson slams against the door...
The car skids to a stop at a slight angle in the middle of  ural road.
The Shape goes into a fit in the back seat.
Sartain remains calm. He looks at THE POLICE CRUISER that is uarding the gate to Laurie's compound a hundred yards away.

INT. POLICE CRUISER. NIGHT
Officer Richards and Officer Francis listen to rock music o he radio and eat food.
_OFFICER RICHARDS
"You know what sounds good with a  baloney sandwich?"
Francis see something in the distance.
_OFFICER RICHARDS (CONT'D)
 ...An IPA.

_OFFICER FRANCIS
(DISTRACTED)
"What the hell?"
They strain their eyes as they see the flashing lights an linding headlights of the distant vehicle parked in th iddle of the road.

INT. HAWKINS' SQUAD CAR. NIGHT.
The Shape kicks the window in the back seat while Sartai its calmly in the front.
_DR. SARTAIN
"What greater spectacle than to reunite two old friends. Michael Myers and Laurie Strode. A historical reunion."
The back seat settles. All is quiet until...
_DR. SARTAIN (CONT'D)
"Michael. She's been waiting for you. Are you ready?"
SUDDENLY, the barrier from behind Sartain is thrust wit rute strength inward. Its velocity pins Dr. Sartain agains he steering wheel.
Allyson screams as the cage slams Sartain until he is still.

INT. POLICE CRUISER. NIGHT.
The cops look at the car ahead. They can't see the commotio ecause of the glare of the lights. They turn off thei adio. They hear the horn blaring.
_OFFICER RICHARDS

"601? 606 to 601? Hawkins. Turn your fuckin' radio on. Hawkins?"
_OFFICER FRANCIS
"Let's check it out."
Officer Richards puts the car in gear.

INT. HAWKINS' SQUAD CAR. NIGHT.
The Shape is out. Allyson panics in the back seat as Th hape grabs Sartain by the feet and drags him out of the car.

His head hits the concrete hard. Sartain struggles. He is no nconscious yet.
The Shape takes a knee and gags Sartain against the pavement e hears the loudspeaker from the police car.
_OFFICER HAWKINS
(over P.A.)
"Hawkins, please respond."
As The Shape stands to see the approaching police car llyson makes an escape and dashes into the woods.
The Shape watches her go and then looks down to an injure artain at his feet.
_DR. SARTAIN
"But you said I could watch."
The Shape lift HIS BOOT OVER SARTAIN'S HEAD. Sartain looks a is own reflection in the metal side of the vehicle. A sic rin on the doctor's face--
_DR. SARTAIN (CONT'D)
"Do it."
The SHAPE STOMPS DOWN ON DOCTOR SARTAIN'S HEAD. HIS SKUL AVES IN-- BRAINS SHIT OUT.

EXT. WOODS. NIGHT.
Allyson looks back and sees The Shape-- staring down at his oot on Sartain's crushed skull.
The Shape TILTS HIS HEAD CURIOUSLY.
Allyson runs as fast as she can.

The light blinds The Shape who DROPS DOWN TO THE GROUND OU F SIGHT OF THE OFFICERS.

EXT. ROAD/POLICE CRUISER. NIGHT
Richards and Francis have their guns draw as they step towar he crime scene.
They throw hand signals then move about either direction o awkins' squad car.
They take a beat to find their courage and step to the other ide of the squad car.
THE SHAPE IS GONE. Just the gruesome remains of Docto artain.
They don't see The Shape rising from behind them. Behind th lashing light of their own squad car. WATCHING.

INT. BEDROOM. LAURIE'S HOUSE. NIGHT.
Laurie looks out through the blinds of her bedroom window.
_SHANAH
"I'm scared. I don't know how to do this."
Laurie grabs Shanah's weapon and looks her in the eye.
_LAURIE
"You never wanted to listen when I spoke about that night... but this is why. We fight to survive. He is a killer. But he will be killed tonight. I've been preparing for this for a long time. And whether you know it or not, so have you."
Shanah is scared, weeping, but shakes her head `yes'. Lauri ees how scared and unprepared her daughter is.
_LAURIE (CONT'D)
"Shanah... I'm sorry. For everything."
Shanah sees her mom's eyes welling up. She hugs Laurie aurie hasn't felt this in years and hugs her as tight as sh an.

EXT. WOODS. NIGHT.
Allyson moves quickly through the woods. Bloody, tired imping. She grabs a tree to catch her breath.
She sees the disturbing SILHOUETTES OF MANNEQUINS that Lauri sed as target practice. Frozen expressions with bulle idden faces all around her.

INT. LAURIE'S HOUSE. NIGHT.
Ray plays with the untangled yo-yo that Laurie had at th ommunity center. He watches the security camera monitors.
He sees a police cruiser slowly rolling up to the front o he house. It hits a couple of garbage cans and then stops.
Curious, he gets up and goes to the front door. The door ha wo small windows with color glass. He sees the cruiser wit ights flashing.

EXT. LAURIE'S HOUSE. NIGHT.
Ray steps out onto the front porch with the yo-yo as the win himes blow in the breeze.
_RAY
"Any word on Allyson?"
No response.
_RAY (CONT'D)
"You guys need some coffee or something?"
Ray strains to see Officer Richards in the front seat of th ruiser. Ray waves. No response.
Ray moves toward the car, knocks on the window and then opens he driver's side door.
What he sees is a mind-blowing moment of horror: Office ichards has his throat slit and Doctor Sartain's pen blad ammed through his ear. AND- in his lap sits Officer Francis ead...
CARVED LIKE A JACK O' LANTERN WITH TRIANGLE EYES CUT OUT,  RIANGLE HOLE WHERE HIS NOSE ONCE WAS AND A JAGGED SMILE CU ITH A BLADE. A FLASH LIGHT POINTS UP THROUGH THE NEC LLUMINATING THE ENTIRE NIGHTMARE. 

Ray loses his balance and takes a step back. He hears th amiliar wind chimes.
Ray turns slowly and sees THE SHAPE step up behind him an nstantly wrap the chain of the wind chime around Ray's neck.
He chokes and wheezes and swings his arms wildly trying to ave himself.
After a great struggle, he falls to the ground... Dead. 

INT. LAURIE'S HOUSE. LIVING ROOM. NIGHT.
Laurie walks down the steps holding a PUMP ACTION 12-GAUGE.
_LAURIE
"Ray?"
She steps up to the front door. She looks through the istorted glass of the windows and sees in plain sight...
THE SHAPE with his back to her, standing perfectly still ove ay's body.
Laurie locks the door, cringes as she registers the scene an urns away.
She sees Shanah walk down the staircase.
_SHANAH
"Mom?"
Laurie shakes her head and holds her finger to her lips. Sh eets Shanah in the middle of the room.
_LAURIE
"He's here Shanah. Michael is here. Go to the shelter and hide. You'll be safe there."
_SHANAH
"What about Ray? What about Allyson?"
_LAURIE
"I'll take care of it. It's time. Now. It all ends tonight."
Shanah nods through tears and runs to the kitchen. She spin he island counter clock-wise. She shares a look with Lauri s her mother takes position. Armed at the front door. I his good-bye?
 90.

Shanah disappears into the shelter and the island slide ack, covering the secret door.
Laurie turns back toward the window with her shotgun to kee n eye along The Shape. Before she gets a glance, the glas f one window smashes.
THE SHAPE'S RIGHT ARM reaches through and grabs her by th ide and then slides to her throat. Her weapon is useless a e pulls her into the door.
THE OTHER ARM punches through the other window and reache esperately for her.
She spins around until her back is to the door. Her left han eaches up and grabs hold of The Shape's spastic hand. 
With her right hand, Laurie PUMPS HER SHOTGUN and points i oward The Shape's LEFT HAND. He grabs hold of the barrel an he pulls the trigger. HIS LEFT HAND EXPLODES. TWO FINGER isintegrated by the blast. His thumb and two others remain. e lets go and his arms retreat.

INT. LAURIE'S HOUSE. BASEMENT. NIGHT
Shanah hears footsteps above her. She looks and considers th verwhelming arsenal beside her: A crossbow, a semi-automati ifle, a shotgun and a small handgun, etc.
She grabs the smallest firearm on the wall and walks to th ase of the ladder as footsteps pace above her.
She hears the island move aside and the hinges of the doo ift open.
She's nervous, but the gun is ready. She pulls the trigger LICK.
_LAURIE
"It only works if you load it, Sweetheart."
She's relieved to see her mother who climbs quickly down wit er shotgun to join her.
Laurie walks to the wall and exchanges her pump-actio hotgun for a rifle.
She flips a circuit breaker to turn the lights off upstair nd then flips a switch to slide the island back into place.
They listen quietly as Laurie loads rounds into the rifle.

The sound of the front door opening. FOOTSTEPS above them ust falls from the ceiling.
Laurie tracks the steps with the site of her gun.
_LAURIE (CONT'D)
"He's right there."
Laurie fire three rounds into the ceiling at the position sh uspects The SHAPE to be. All goes silent.

EXT. LAURIE'S HOUSE. NIGHT.
Allyson approaches and sees the house through the trees, fac ull with both fear and relief.

INT. LAURIE'S HOUSE. LIVING ROOM. NIGHT.
CLOSE on Laurie as she rises from her basement door with he ifle ready.
She looks around the dark living room and sees no sign of Th hape. Her senses are on high alert.
_LAURIE
"Michael?!"
She hears a noise, turns and fires. Blasts a hole in the wal f the living room. The muzzle flash lights the room.
_LAURIE (CONT'D)
"Michael?! Come out."
Another sound. BLAM! She fires at a shadow.
A tree branch hits the window.
She turns, blasts the kitchen pantry.
Laurie walks to the living room. Blasts the staircas pstairs.
She disappears into a back room. We hear a three more blasts.
She comes back out and looks toward a living room closet. Sh hoots a hole in it. Listens. Hears weeping in the distance.
She looks out the broken window of the front door and see llyson crying. Her granddaughter kneeled over the body o er dead father.
Laurie switch gears from a predator to the protector.

_LAURIE (CONT'D)
"Allyson, you can't be here."
She run to her upset granddaughter.
_LAURIE (CONT'D)
"I'm so sorry. It's not over. You need to run. Run and hide. Go to the road and don't look back. Get help. Save yourself."
_ALLYSON
"I'm not leaving without you."
_LAURIE
"You must. Go now. I love you."
Allyson gets up and walks backwards. She look to the fron oor and sees The Shape standing on the porch.
_ALLYSON
"Grandmother?!"
Laurie turns and instinctively aims the gun toward The Shap nd fires. The bullet blasts directly over The Shape's houlder. A porch light shatters.
-- Miss. She's out of bullets.
Laurie quickly drops the gun and pulls a large hunting knif ut of a sheath on her belt. The Shape stands with a kitche nife in his hand. A CLASSIC SHOWDOWN.
He steps off the porch toward her. Laurie looks back and see llyson stumbling backwards.
With the mind-set of a mamma bear, Laurie turns back to Th hape and charges him.
Their blades meet. Limbs entangled. The Shape loses blood rom his missing fingers, but his momentum is relentless. H rives his knife into Laurie's chest. She swings and slices is arm.
