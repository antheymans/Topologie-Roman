"His cognitive series, his interviews with orphans, Ethology theorists' work... And then he in turn was supported strongly by Harry Harlow's rhesus monkey study. Now you guys, you gotta think, this is the 1950's, this was radical! This flew in the face of traditional learning theory, of B.F. Skinner's classical and instrumental conditioning. Now, Bowlby is going to argue that human survival depends on us falling in love. It depends on me falling in love with my mother, and my mother falling in love with me. And if that doesn't happen, we're pretty much doomed. Now think about it. A tiger chases our tribe out of a cave. Now an ideal mother goes, "Huh! My baby! I love you! I'll protect you!" Or... "Well you, why am I going to pick you up? You're going to slow me down. You... are... tiger kibble!""
The class laughs.

We're throwing out candies for the kids, and soccer balls, and Beanie Babies, and Frisbees... Um, like, smokes for the adults. And they loved, they absolutely loved, Gatorade.

_MASON
"So... so it's gone?"
_DAD
"Yeah, some sucker collector from California paid twenty-two grand for it, which is great 'cause I basically got to pay for this in cash. I only paid eighty-five hundred for that thing way back when. I mean, you know, cars are generally a terrible investment. You know? Soon as you drive them off the lot you got a used car on your hands, and the value's only dropping from there."
(MORE)

_DAD (CONT'D)
"But... if you take care of it, you know, and you get lucky and it's a classic, you know, the value starts going up again. I mean shit, you got guys paying hundreds of thousands of dollars for some Shelby Cobra."

 "Oh. This is going to be Mason's
"when he turns 16.""
_DAD
"What are you..? Alright, first off, I have no memory of that, alright? Second of all, I would never say that. Never."
_MASON
"Yeah. You did though."
_DAD
"What? Mason. Come on, what about your sister? I'm just gonna forget about her? Come on, how's that fair? Huh? Anthony Nagar, what the?"
(MORE)

_DAD (CONT'D)
(laughs)
"Are you...? Oh, come on! I mean, you're not... Ughh. Look, you can sit there like there's a death in the family, alright, but bottom line is that was my car. Alright? I paid for it, I took care of it, and I can do whatever I want with it. Alright? I'm sorry if you had other ideas about it but when you get older you can save up and buy a car of your own. And be cool like I used to be. Or... you can get a mini-van."

"Oh, my god... Okay, well."
_SAMANTHA
"Yeah."
_ANNIE
"Have you ever seen her in concert?"
_SAMANTHA
"No. But she's coming to Houston in April."
_ANNIE
"She's coming to Houston?"

_MASON
"Thanks."
_DAD
"Yeah, basically, I put the band back together for you."
Annie Laughs.
_DAD (CONT'D)
"You know, whenever you listen to too much of the solo stuff, it kind of becomes a drag, you know? But you put 'em next to each other, alright, and they start to elevate each other... and then you can hear it. Huh! It's The Beatles. You know?"
_MASON
"I don't know. I think I always just liked Paul the best."
_DAD
"It doesn't matter, you know, you're missing the point. There is no favorite Beatle! That's what I'm saying. It's in the balance. That's what made them the greatest fucking rock band in the world. Okay? You know, and there's this decade of music out there that's been scattered. Alright?"
(MORE)

_DAD (CONT'D)
"And now it has been carefully found, arranged, and ordered for you, by your loving father."
_ANNIE
"Very arranged and very organized, over and over again by your loving father."
_DAD
"Yes, yes, yes. So, I mean, look at that-- look at that, uh, top of Volume II, first four tracks... You've got"
 "Band on the Run" into "My Sweet
"Lord", into "Jealous Guy", into"
 "Photograph". I mean, come on.
"It's like the perfect segue. You got Paul, who takes you to the party, George who talks to you about God, John who says no, it's about love and pain, and then Ringo who just says hey, can't we enjoy what we have while we have it? It's a good record. I shit you not."

_MASON
"Not yet."
_TURLINGTON
"Completed your, uh, digital contact sheet?"
_MASON
"Not quite, but... I mean, it's not gonna take me long."
_TURLINGTON
"Not yet. Not quite. Darkroom time is extra-curricular. I mean technically, you don't ever have to be in here these days, and certainly not until you've completed your assignments. That's the deal."

_MASON
"Sorry."
_TURLINGTON
"I'm worried about you, Mason."
_MASON
"Why is that?"
_TURLINGTON
"I'll tell you why. The images you're turning in, they're cool. You're looking at things in a really unique way. Got a lot of natural talent."
_MASON
"Thanks."
_TURLINGTON
"Yeah, but, that and fifty cents will just get you a cup of coffee in this old world. I've met a lot of talented people over the years. How many of them made it professionally without discipline, commitment, and a really good work ethic?"
Mason shrugs and shakes his head, unsure.
_TURLINGTON (CONT'D)
"I can tell you. I can count it on two fingers. Zero. It's not gonna happen for you, Mason. The world is too competitive. There are too many talented people who are willing to work hard. And a butt-load of morons who are untalented, who are more than willing to surpass you. As a matter of fact, a lot of them are sitting in that classroom out there right now. Hm? You know what they're doing? They're doing their assignments, which is what you're supposed to be doing, but you're not. You're in here. Why is that? Are you special, Mason?"
_MASON
"No, but I mean the things you're talking about, like work ethic or whatever, I feel like I do work pretty hard. I spend the whole weekend taking pictures a lot of times."

_TURLINGTON
"You like football, Mason?"
_MASON
"Not really."
_TURLINGTON
"Yeah, I know you don't. That's why I've just assigned you to shoot the football game tonight. Okay? It starts at 7:30. I want you to get there early. I want you to shoot a full card, three hundred images, and I want 'em downloaded, I want 'em sorted, and I want to see them very first thing Monday. Okay? You want to know why I'm doing this?"
_MASON
"I guess."
_TURLINGTON
"Who do you want to be, Mason? What do you want to do?"
_MASON
"I want to take pictures. Make art."
_TURLINGTON
"Any dip-shit can take pictures, Mason. Art, that's special. What can you bring to it that nobody else can?"
_MASON
"That's what I'm trying to find out."
_TURLINGTON
"Try harder. Hey, maybe in twenty years you can call old Mr. Turlington and you can say, "Thank you, sir, for that terrific dark room chat we had that day.""
(walking away)

_SHEENA
"Why aren't you?"
_MASON
"I mean, I guess it's... just being afraid of what people would think. You know, judgment."
_SHEENA
"Yeah. I guess it's really easy to say, like, I don't care what anyone else thinks, but, everyone does, you know? Deep down."
_MASON
"Exactly. I find myself so furious at all these people that I'm in contact with just for controlling me or whatever, but you know, they're not even aware they're doing it."
_SHEENA
"Yeah. So... in this perfect world where no one's controlling you, what's different? What changes?"
_MASON
"Everything. I mean, I just wanna be able to do anything I want, because it makes me feel alive. As opposed to giving me the appearance of normality."
_SHEENA
"Whatever that means."
_MASON
"I don't think it means much."
_SHEENA
"You're kinda weird, you know that?"
_MASON
"Yeah?"

Sheena laughs.
_MASON (CONT'D)
"I really like talking with you. I don't usually even try to like vocalize my thoughts or feelings or anything. Just, I don't know, it just never sounds right. Words are stupid."

_MASON
"I'm sorry."
_JIM
"Yeah, been hearin' a lot of that lately. See, but you don't actually care. You just kinda... kinda come and go as you please and you don't care if your mom's upset or what time you gotta be home... Is that what's up?"

Mason exits XT. HIGHWAY - DAY/ INT. TRUCK
"Suburban Wars" plays. Mason drives, Sheena is in the
passenger seat.
_SHEENA
 ... That sounds to me like just
"another extreme Mason view of everything."
_MASON
"Not at all! I finally figured it out. It's like when they realized it was gonna be too expensive to actually build cyborgs and robots... I mean, the costs of that were impossible. They decided to just let humans turn themselves into robots. That's what's going on right now."
_SHEENA
"Oh, right now?"
_MASON
"Yeah! I mean, why not? There are billions of us just laying around, not really doing anything. We don't cost anything. I mean we're even pretty good at self-maintenance and reproducing constantly. And as it turns out, we're already biologically programmed for our little cyborg upgrades."

_SHEENA
"How?"
_MASON
"Seriously. I read this thing other day about how, like, when you hear that ding on your inbox you get a, like a dopamine rush in your brain. It's like we're being chemically rewarded for allowing ourselves to be brainwashed. How evil is that? We're fucked."
_SHEENA
"So you deleting your Facebook page is gonna change all that? Remember when Trevor deleted his Facebook page last year and everyone just hated him? You made more fun of him than anyone."
_MASON
"I still make fun of Trevor, though."
_SHEENA
"But it looked like he was so pathetically desperate for attention. Or to be different, or something."
_MASON
"That's just 'cause they did that lame story about it in the school paper."
_SHEENA
"And then he had to make a big announcement about it when he came back a month later."
_MASON
"That's the thing though, I'm not doing it for attention. I just want to try and not live my life through a screen. I want, like, some kind of actual interaction. A real person, not just the profile they put up."
Sheena's looking at her phone.
_SHEENA
"Oh, I'm sorry. Were you saying something?"
She laughs.

_MASON
"Yeah, okay, I know you're joking, but, I mean, it's kinda true you have been, you know, checking your phone this whole time, and so what are you really doing? You don't care what your friends are up to on Saturday afternoon but you're also obviously not fully experiencing my profound bitching so... it's like everyone's just stuck in, like, an in-between state. Not really experiencing anything."
_SHEENA
"It's not an experience, it's just information. Look, for example, I just got the address of the club where we're meeting them later, so we won't be wandering the streets of Austin lost for an hour tonight. Thank you very much, Facebook. And I just texted my mom back."
_MASON
"Oh, that's -- that's groundbreaking. She hasn't seen you in, like, minutes?"
_SHEENA
"Oh! Oh my god, most importantly, Meg's family just got a miniature pet pig."
Sheena hands him the phone.
_MASON
(looks at phone photo)
"Hm!"
(Laughs)
"Okay, you're right. That is a --"
_SHEENA
"Right?"
_MASON
"That is a really cute, tiny pig. Our lives can go on."

"I want one."

_SHEENA
"Um, I'm not really sure yet. We're gonna look at apartments tomorrow, um, but I know my parents sorta were expecting me to live in a dorm."
_SAMANTHA
"Yeah."
_SHEENA
"Yeah. But I mean, I'm paying my way through college, so it doesn't really matter that much."
_SAMANTHA
"Yeah, you don't have to listen to your parents after you turn eighteen. I mean, especially if they're not helping you financially."
They laugh.
_SHEENA
"That's what I figured."
_SAMANTHA
"But I mean, living in a dorm isn't so bad."
_SHEENA
"Yeah."

_SAMANTHA
"I mean especially if it's a coed dorm. I mean, I've never been around like, so many cute guys at once. Like, college is really fun."
They laugh.
_SHEENA
"I'm excited."
_SAMANTHA
"It's great, yeah."

_SHEENA
"What?"

_MASON
"I don't know, doesn't it all seem a little overwhelming? I mean, college? I mean, I like the idea of being away from home and gaining skills and getting better at photography. I just, I don't know, I'm not counting on it being some big transformative experience."
_SHEENA
"I don't think it's that transformative. I just see it as the next step."
_MASON
"But it's like a pre-ordained slot that's already got your name and number on it. I don't think it's the key to my future. Cause, like, I mean, look at my mom. She got her degree, and got a pretty good job, she can pay her bills..."
_SHEENA
"Well, I like your mom."
_MASON
"Well, I like my mom, too. I just mean, basically, she's still just as fucking confused as I am."

"It's not the same, though. I mean, you never got to know her."

_DAD
"No, I know, I know. It's not the same."

_DAD
"We're up here raiding the green room. Hope that's okay."

I mean, everyone's just changing s uch. The odds of two young peopl taying on the same wavelength are...
"MASON"
Yeah, but still --
"DAD"
Look, and I also guarantee you tha very day of your life that you spen rying over some silly girl is  omplete waste of time.
"MASON"
She wasn't a silly girl, though.  ean, she's a serious person.  eally thought we were --
"DAD"
What?
"MASON"
I don't know.
"DAD"
Here's the truth. Women are neve atisfied. Ok? They're alway ooking to potentially trade up an hat's, I'm sorry to say, what  hink has happened to you my fin eathered friend.
"MASON"
What does that even mean?
"DAD"
It means don't hand over the control o your self-esteem to Sheila.
"MASON"
Sheena.
"DAD"
Alright. It means you are responsibl or you, not your girlfriend, no our mom, not me. You. And if yo ruly take care of you, you will b mazed at how much girls like Sheen tart lining up at your front door.
"MASON"
Great.

"DAD"
Yeah, you know, you just gott eparate yourself from the pack i ome way. Excel at something, yo now, and then you have your pick o he litter when them front-runnin ussies start sniffing around.
"MASON"
So what you're saying is, I shoul ake up lacrosse.
"DAD"
Exactly. Or you could, you know tart a band. Worked for me a lon ime ago. I think it's still workin or Jimmy. Or you just keep takin ictures.
"MASON"
She hated the pictures I took o er.
"DAD"
Alright. I'm sick to death of her kay? I only met her a few time nd yes she was cute, alright. But ruth be told I always thought sh as a little bit, you know, a littl it too square for you. Y'know, no uite the same vibe.
"MASON"
You really thought that?
"DAD"
On some subtle, lower level. I mean h, I wasn't surprised when it turne ut she was interested in som nucklehead lacrosse player, okay  mean, bottom line is, it's al iming with these things. Y'know  mean, uh, take your mom and me 'know I think I probably turne nto the boring castrated guy sh anted me to be fifteen or twent ears ago, y'know? And man I'm no aying she was wrong to be pissed 'm not, I'm just saying that, y'know he could have been a little mor atient... a little more forgiving.
"MASON"
Would've saved me that parade o runken assholes.

Dad gestures zipping his lip, saying nothing.
_MASON (CONT'D)
"So what's the point?"
_DAD
"Of what?"
_MASON
"I don't know, any of this. Everything."
_DAD
"Everything? What's the point? I mean I sure as shit don't know. I mean, but, neither does anybody else. Okay, we're all just winging it, you know? I mean the good news is you're feeling stuff. You know? And you got to hold onto that. You do. I mean you get older and you don't feel as much. You're skin gets tougher. The point is those pictures you took. Thousands of submissions from all over the state and you won."
_MASON
"Well, I got silver. And nine other people did, too."
_DAD
"I'm gonna kill you. I'm tryin' to tell you that I believe in you, Mason. I think you're really special, and if some girl doesn't see that, then fuck her, y'know?"
Jimmy's at the mic.
_JIMMY (O.S.)
"Hey, this next one goes out to a young man in the house --"
_DAD
"Woo-oho!"
_JIMMY
"Known him since he was just a small boy, now he's all graduated from high school, making me feel old. Happy high school graduation, Mason."

_MOM
"Thank you. Okay guys, let's be clear. I'm going to break this into four categories. One. Anything you wanna keep from your childhood and your taking with you. Two. Throwing away. Three. Donating. Four. Whatever you wanna try to sell at the garage sell next weekend, whatever we don't sell, we're donating."
_MASON
"Doesn't the apartment have like an attic, or storage or something?"
_MOM
"No. You're missing the point. We're not going to drag a bunch of crap to mom's tiny apartment."
_SAMANTHA
"Can't believe we're moving again."
_MOM
"No, I'm moving! You moved two years ago. You have an apartment in Austin. Mason is moving the fall. I'm done. This will be great for me. I'll have all these options. I could take a sabbatical. I could get some writing done and try to get published."
_MASON
"What about Christmas, though? What are we gonna do?"
_SAMANTHA
"I'm not sharing a room with him."
_MOM
"One of you will sleep on the couch, and we'll use that blow-up mattress."
_SAMANTHA
"How am I supposed to do my laundry?"
_MOM
"Sam, I'm gently pushing you out of the nest."
(MORE)

_MOM (CONT'D)
"And on your way down you may magically find some quarters that you use to do laundry in your own apartment. Come on! You guys are adults. You need to take some responsibility! And what do you want?"
Mom puts her glasses on.
_MASON
"I'm gonna get the veggie burger."
_SAMANTHA
"I'm not having anything, not hungry."
Mom takes her glasses off.
_MOM
"What's wrong with you?"
_SAMANTHA
"I'm sick."
_MOM
"What is it, your head? Do you have a fever?"
_MASON
"She's pregnant."
_SAMANTHA
(weak laugh)
"No. To be honest, I drank way too much last night."
_MOM
"You weren't driving, were you?"
_SAMANTHA
"No. No. Carrie's back home, too, and we just hung out. You know, peach Smirnoffs, they just go down so easy."
_MOM
"No, no. Hey - that's not an excuse. You can still pack boxes. These people want to move in as soon as possible."
The assistant restaurant manager, who'll we'll come to kno s ERNESTO, approaches the table.

_ERNESTO
"Hi guys. I'm Ernesto, how are you?"
(to Mom)
"Uh, you probably don't remember me, but I worked on your septic line years ago."
_MOM
"Oh, yeah."
_ERNESTO
"Believe it or not, you changed my life. Yeah, you told me that day that I was smart and that I should go to school. I took your advice! I signed up for English classes and then a year later I went to community college and I got my associates degree. And I'm working on my bachelors now at Texas State. And I'm also one of the managers here."
_MOM
"That's great."
_ERNESTO
"Uh, it's good to see you. Because I really wanted a chance to thank you for that. Gracias. It really meant a lot to me. Don't worry about lunch. It's on me. It's the least I can do."
_MOM
"Thanks."

INT. APARTMENT - MORNIN ason is packing a box, in mid-conversation with Mom, who i eated in another room.
_MASON
 ...Isn't that kind of crazy though,
"that a computer knows who you are from just twenty questions off a form? I guess there are really only like eight types of people in the world."
Mom goes to the kitchen and pours coffee into a mug.
_MASON (CONT'D)
"I mean there are subsets, like male and female, but apparently we're not as unique as we want to think we are."
_MOM
"Have you even talked to this guy yet?"
_MASON
"No, but we've been trading emails. He seems pretty cool. He's studying literature, and uh, anthropology, and he's way into Bright Eyes... so that's not so bad. But anyways, he was telling me about how the system they use for assigning roommates is kind of spooky. Like, the Freshmen satisfaction rate for new roommates used to be like 60%, and now it's 100%. Just cause of the computer."
_MOM
"Well. Sounds like he'll be a good roommate, then."
_MASON
"Yeah. But we've pretty much decided that soon they won't even need a questionnaire. Because they'll just let the NSA scan your digital ghost, and they'll tell you who your roommate is, based on everything you've ever said, written, or clicked."
Mason walks back into the living room, carrying a box. H olds up a framed picture.

_MASON (CONT'D)
"Did you -- Did you put this in here again?"
Mom laughs.
_MASON (CONT'D)
"I don't want it."
_MOM
"Come on, it's the first picture you ever took."
_MASON
"Well, I mean, all the more reason to leave it behind, right?"
Mason goes to put the picture back in his room, while Mo uddenly breaks into quiet sobs e comes back out, wearing a backpack, and notices Mom crying.
_MASON (CONT'D)
"What?"
_MOM
(crying)
"Nothing."
_MASON
"No, what is it?"
_MOM
"Nothing!"
_MASON
"Mom..."
_MOM
"This is the worst day of my life."
_MASON
"What are you talking about?"
_MOM
"I knew this day was coming. I just -- I didn't know you were gonna be so fuckin' happy to be leaving."
_MASON
"I mean, it's not that I'm that happy. What do you, what do you expect?"

_MOM
"You know what I'm realizing? My life is just gonna go, like that! This series of milestones. Getting married, having kids, getting divorced, the time that we thought you were dyslexic, when I taught you how to ride a bike, getting divorced AGAIN, getting my masters degree, finally getting the job I wanted, sending Samantha off to college, sending YOU off the college... You know what's next? Huh? It's my fuckin' funeral!"
A beat.
_MOM (CONT'D)
"Just go, and leave my picture!"
Stunned, Mason doesn't know what to say.
