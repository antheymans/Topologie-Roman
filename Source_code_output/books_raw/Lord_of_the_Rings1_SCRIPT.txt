Frodo turns a page...there before him, is a map of the Shire.
_FRODO
(quietly)
"I miss the Shire...I spent all my childhood pretending I was off somewhere else...off with you, on one of your adventures..."

_SAM
"I do..."
_FRODO
"More than anything."
_SAM
"I did. It's just...we did what Gandalf wanted, didn't we? We got the Ring this far, to Rivendell...and I thought... seeing as how you're on the mend, we'd be off soon. Off home."
_FRODO
"You're right, Sam. Frodo looks at Sam..."

_ELROND
"And yet to have come so far still bearing the Ring...the hobbit has shown extraordinary resilience to its evil."
_GANDALF
"It is a burden he should never have to had to bear. We can ask no more of Frodo."
_ELROND
"Gandalf, the enemy is moving. Sauron's forces are massing in the east. His eye is fixed on Rivendell. And Saruman, you tell me, has betrayed us. Our list of allies grows thin."
(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
_GANDALF
"His treachery runs deeper than you know. By foul craft, Saruman has crossed Orc with Goblin Men...he is breeding an army in the caverns of Isengard. An army that can move in Sunlight and cover great distance at speed. Saruman is coming for the Ring."
Elrond turns and walks away...
_ELROND
"This evil cannot be concealed by the power of the Elves...We do not have the strength to fight both Mordor and Isengard...Gandalf...the ring cannot stay here."
Gandalf turns and looks out the window ounds of arrivals...Gandalf watches as Boromir rides throug ivendell gate, followed by Legolas and Gimli.

"This peril belongs to all Middle earth. They must decide how to end it. Not just for themselves but for those who come after. Elrond approaches Gandalf."
_ELROND (CONT'D)
"The time of the Elves is over. My people are leaving these shores. Who will you look to when we have gone? The dwarves? They hide in their mountains seeking riches. They care nothing for the troubles of others."
_GANDALF
"It is in Men that we must place our hope."
_ELROND
"Men? Men are weak. The race of Men is failing. The blood of Numenor is all but spent, its pride and dignity forgotten. It is because of men the Ring survives."
FLASH INSERT: With the broken sword, Isildur slices of auron's finger. Elrond reacts.

_STRIDER
"You cannot wield it. None of us can. The one ring answers to Sauron alone...it has no other master. Boromir turns and looks at Strider, coolly."

"And what would a ranger know of this matter?"
Strider says nothing and Boromir turns away dismissively EGOLAS stands...

_BOROMIR
"One does not simply walk into Mordor. Its black gates are guarded by more than just Orcs. There is evil there that does not sleep and the Great Eye is ever watchful. It is a barren wasteland, riddled with fire and ash and dust...the very air you breathe is a poisonous fume. Not with ten thousand men could you do this. It is folly."
