"Terrible."
_MED-TECH
"Just terrible? That's better than yesterday at least."
_RIPLEY
"How long have I been on Gateway station?"
_MED-TECH
"Just a couple of days. Do you feel up to a visitor?"
Ripley shrugs, not caring. The door opens and a MA nters, although Ripley sees only what he is carrying  familiar large, orange TOMCAT.
_RIPLEY
"Jones!"
She grabs the cat like a life preserver.
_RIPLEY
(cooing baby-cat talk)
"Come here Jonesy you ugly old moose...you ugly thing."
Jones patiently endures Ripley's embarrassing display eeming none the worse for wear. The visitor sit eside the bed and Ripley finally notices him. He i hirtyish and handsome, in a suit that looks executiv r legal, the tie loosened with studied casualness.  mile referred to as "winning."
_MAN
"Nice room. I'm Burke. Carter Burke. I work for the company, but other than that I'm an okay guy. Glad to see you're feeling better. I'm told the weakness and disorientation should pass soon. Side effects of the unusually long hypersleep, or something like that."
_RIPLEY
"How long was I out there? They won't tell me anything."
_BURKE
(soothing)
"Well, maybe you shouldn't worry about that just yet."
Ripley grabs his arm, surprising him.
_RIPLEY
"How long?"
Burke gazes at her, thoughtful.
_BURKE
"All right. My instinct says you're strong enough to handle this...Fifty-seven years."
Ripley is stunned. She seems to deflate, her expressio assing through amazement and shock to realization o ll she has lost. Friends. Family. Her world.
_RIPLEY
"Fifty-seven...oh, Christ..."
_BURKE
"You'd drifted right through the core systems. It's blind luck that deep-salvage team caught you when they...are you all right?"
Ripley coughs suddenly as if choking and her expressio ecomes one of dawning horror. Burke hands her a glas f water from the nightstand. She slaps it away. I hatters with a SMASH. Jones dives, yowling. Riple rabs her chest, struggling as if she is strangling he Med-Tech hits a console button.

They try to restrain her as she thrashes, knocking ove quipment. Her EKG races like mad. Jones, under  abinet, hisses wide-eyed.

"No.. I've slept enough."
The Med-Tech shrugs and switches off. Touching a butto n the nightstand she opens the viewport, REVEALIN ateway and the turquoise Earth. She hugs Jones to he nd rocks with him like a child, still shattered by th ightmare. Shivering. Sleep is far off.

WIDER ANGLE as Jones steps back confused from th IGH-RESOLUTION ENVIRONMENTAL WALL SCREEN, a sort o inerama video-loop. Ripley sits on a bench in what w ow SEE is an ATRIUM off the medical center, stil omewhere in the bowels of Gateway Station. Benches ome unenthusiastic potted trees. The sterile corridor ISIBLE beyond glass doors b.g urke ENTERS in his usual mode, casual haste.
_BURKE
"Sorry...I've been running behind all morning."
Ripley seems healthier now, but still a bit brittle.
_RIPLEY
"Have they located my daughter yet?"
_BURKE
"Well, I was going to wait until after the inquest..."
He opens his briefcase, removing a sheet of printe ard copy, including a telestat photo.
_RIPLEY
"Is she...?"
_BURKE
(scanning)
"Amanda Ripley-McClaren. Married name, I guess. Age: sixty-six"
 ...at time of death. Two years
"ago."
(looks at her)
"I'm sorry."
Ripley studies the PHOTOGRAPH, stunned he face of a woman in her mid-sixties. It could b nybody. She tries to reconcile the face with th ittle girl she once knew.
_RIPLEY
"Amy."
_BURKE
(reading)
"Cancer. Hmmmm. They still haven't licked that one. Cremated. Interred Parkside Repository, Little Chute, Wisconsin. No children."
Ripley gazes off, into the pseudo-landscape, into th ast.
_RIPLEY
"I promised her I'd be home for her birthday. Her eleventh birthday. I sure missed that one."
(pause)
"Well...she has already learned to take my promises with a grain of salt. When it came to flight schedules, anyway."
Burke nods, a simpatico presence.
_RIPLEY
"You always think you can make it up to somebody...later, you know. But now I never can. I never can."
Let's get one thing straight...Ripley can be one toug ady. But the terror, the loss, the emptiness are, i his moment, overwhelming. She cries silently urke puts a reassuring hand on her arm.

"The hearing convenes at 0930. You don't want to be late."

"You read my deposition...it's complete and accurate."
_BURKE
"Look, I believe you, but there are going to be some heavyweights in there. You got Feds, you got interstellar commerce commission, you got colonial administration, insurance company guys..."
_RIPLEY
"I get the picture."
_BURKE
"Just tell them what happened. The important thing is to stay cool and unemotional."
INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - ON RIPLEY - GATEWA he's not cool. Not unemotional.
_RIPLEY
"Do you people have earwax, of what? We have been here three hours. How many different ways do you want me to tell the same story?"
She faces the EIGHT MEMBERS of the board of inquiry at  ong conference table. Gray suits and grim faces. The ren't buying. Behind Ripley on a large VIDEO SCREEN ARKER grins like a goon from his personnel mugshot. Hi ile prints out next to it. BRETT's face and dossie eplace it, and then the others as the SCENE continues.. ANE, LAMBERT, ASH the android traitor, DALLAS AN LEUWEN, the ICC representative, steeples his finger nd frowns.
_VAN LEUWEN
"Look at it from our perspective. You freely admit to detonating the engines of, and thereby destroying, an M-Class star-freighter. A rather expensive piece of hardware..."
_INSURANCE INVESTIGATOR 
(dryly)
"Forty-two million in adjusted dollars. That's minus payload, of course."
_VAN LEUWEN
"The shuttle's flight recorder corroborates some elements of your account. That the Nostromo set down on LV-426, an unsurveyed planet, at that time. That repairs were made. That it resumed its course and was subsequently set for self-destruct. By you. For reasons unknown."
_RIPLEY
"Look, I told you..."
_VAN LEUWEN
"It did not, however, contain any entries concerning the hostile life form you allegedly picked up."
Ripley sense the noose tightening.
_RIPLEY
"Then somebody's gotten to it... doctored the recorder. Who had access to it?"
The ECA (Extrasolar Colonization Administration epresentative (ECA REP) just shakes his head.
_ECA REP
"Would you just listen to yourself for one minute."
Ripley glares at the ECA Rep, a woman on the ungenerou ide of fifty. Van Leuwen sighs with exasperation.
_VAN LEUWEN
"The analysis team which went over your shuttle centimeter by centimeter found no physical evidence of the creature you describe..."
_RIPLEY
(losing it) 
"That's because I blew it out the Goddamn airlock!"
(pause)
"Like I said."
_INSURANCE MAN
(to ECA Rep)
"Are there any species like this"
 'hostile organism' on LV-426?
_ECA REP
"No. It's a rock. No indigenous life larger than a simple virus."
Ripley grits her teeth in frustration.
_RIPLEY
"I told you, it wasn't indigenous. There was an alien spacecraft there. A derelict ship. We homed on its beacon..."
_ECA REP
"To be perfectly frank, we've surveyed over three hundred worlds and no one's ever reported a creature which, using your words..."
(read from Ripley's
 statement)
 ...'gestates in a living human host'
"and has 'concentrated molecular acid for blood.'"
Ripley glances at Burke, silent at the far end of th able. His expression is grim. Her mouth hardens a  bit of the old nail-eating Ripley surfaces.
_RIPLEY
"Look, I can see where this is going. But I'm telling you those things exist. Back on that planetoid is an alien ship and on that ship are thousands of eggs. Thousands. Do you understand? I suggest you find it, using the flight recorder's data. Find it and deal with it -- before one of your survey teams comes back with a little surprise..."
_VAN LEUWEN
"Thank you, Officer Ripley. That will be..."
_RIPLEY
(louder, stepping
 on him)
 ...because just one of those
"things managed to kill my entire crew, within twelve hours of hatching..."
Van Leuwen stands, out of patience.
_VAN LEUWEN
"Thank you, that will be all."
Ripley stares him down, glowering at the board.
_RIPLEY
"That's not all, Goddamnit! If those things get back here, that will be all. Then you can just kiss it good-bye, Jack! Just kiss it goodbye."
Ripley turns sharply away, trembling with frustratio nd anger. Dallas looks back at her from the vide creen, his eyes burning from the photograph, as we:

"You are a head case. Have a donut."

_VAN LEUWEN
"It is the finding of this board of inquiry that Warrent Officer Ellen Ripley, NOC-14672. has acted with questionable judgment and is unfit to hold an ICC license as a commercial flight officer."
Burke watches Ripley taking it on the chin, white-lippe ut subdued.
_VAN LEUWEN
"Said license is hereby suspended indefinitely. No criminal charges will be filed at this time and you are released on own recognizance for a six month period of psychometric probation, to include monthly review by an ICC psychiatric tech..."

_RIPLEY

"Why won't you check out LV-426?"
_VAN LEUWEN
(condescendingly)
"Because I don't have to. The people who live there checked it out years ago and they never reported and 'hostile organism' or alien ship. And by the way, they call it Acheron now."
_RIPLEY
"What are you talking about. What people?"
Van Leuwen steps into an elevator with some others, bu ipley holds the door from closing.
_VAN LEUWEN
"Terraformers...planet engineers. It's what we call a shake 'n' bake colony. They set up atmosphere processors to make the air breathable...big job. Takes decades. They've already been there over twenty years. Peacefully."

Wadded u lankets and pillows line the space, mixed up with  aphazard array of TOYS, STUFFED ANIMALS, DOLLS, CHEA EWELRY, COMIC BOOKS, EMPTY FOOD PACKETS, even  attery operated TAPE PLAYER. All foraged from th recked colony. Ripley marvels at the child' ncredible adaptability, the ability to functions eve n this nightmarish environment ewt edges along the far wall and dives for the hatch ipley grabs her, controlling her in a bear hug. Th id struggles wildly, like a cat at the vets. Eye ide, hands lashing out in a frenzy...but silent. N cream.

Newt goes limp, almost catatonic LOSE ON NEWT'S TRAUMATIZED, VACANT STARE her lip re white and trembling, her eyes track wildly an he flinches from unseen terrors. We READ a dar ightmare world in her eyes ipley's light falls on something amidst the debris..  FRAMED PHOTOGRAPH of Newt, dressed up and smiling  ribbon in her hair.

"Rebecca."
WIDER ANGLE REVEALING Gorman sitting in front of he hile Dietrich watches the readouts from  IO-MONITORING CUFF wrapped around Newt's tiny arm.
_GORMAN
"Now think, Rebecca. Concentrate. Just start at the beginning..."
No response. Ripley enters, carrying a coffee mug.
_GORMAN
"Where are your parents? You have to try..."
_RIPLEY
(sharply)
"Gorman! Give it a rest would you."
Gorman stands with a sigh of dismissal.
_GORMAN
"Total brain-lock."
_DIETRICH
(shrugs)
"Physically she's okay. Borderline malnutrition, but I don't think any permanent damage."
She unsnaps the bio-monitoring cuff.
_GORMAN
"Come on, we're wasting our time."
Gorman and the others exit, leaving only Ripley wit ewt. Through the window of the office, out on th ain floor of the operations room, we SEE Gorma oin Burke and Bishop at a computer terminal ipley kneels beside Newt, brushing the girl's unkemp air out of her eyes in a gentle, maternal fashion.
_RIPLEY
"Here, try this. A little instant hot chocolate."
She wraps the child's hands around the cup. Raise t to her lips for her. The girl drinks mechanically pilling down her chin.
_RIPLEY
(soothing)
"Poor thing. You don't talk much do you? That's okay by me. Most people do a lot of talking and they wind up not saying very much."
She sets the cup down and wipes the child's chin clean.
_RIPLEY
"Uh oh. I made a clean spot here. Now I've done it. Guess I'll just have to do the whole thing."
She pours water from a squeeze bottle onto a smal loth and gently washes the little girl's face ewt's eyes seem to focus on her for the first time.
_RIPLEY
"Hard to believe...there's a little girl under all this. And a pretty one at that."
Newt gazes at her. Ripley smiles NT. OPERATION he ground teams are gathered around a terminal i he computer center. Hudson has the CPU main compute n-line and reading out IGHT ON MONITOR SCREEN as an abstract of the mai olony ground plan drifts across the screen earching udson bashes at the keyboard, his fingers dancin xpertly.
_BURKE
(to Gorman)
"What's he scanning for?"
_GORMAN
"PDT'S. Personal-Data Transmitters. Every adult colonist had one surgically implanted."
_HUDSON
"If they're within twenty klicks we'll read it out here, but so far...zip."
INT. OFFIC ipley is washing Newt's tiny hands with a cloth ink skin emerging from black grime.
_RIPLEY
"I don't know how you managed to stay alive but you're one brave kid, Rebecca."
Newt's voice is almost inaudible.
_NEWT
"N-newt."
Ripley leans closer. Feels like she's breathin n coals. The sound was incomprehensible.
_RIPLEY
"What did you say?"
_NEWT
"Newt. My n-name's Newt. Nobody calls me Rebecca except my dork brother."
Ripley grins inanely, not wanting to move or speak.. r break the spell.
_RIPLEY
"Well, Newt it is then. My name's Ripley...and people call me Ripley."
Ripley picks up her tiny limp hand, shaking i ormally.
_RIPLEY
"Pleased to meet you. And who is this? Does she have a name?"
Newt glances at the disembodied doll, still clutche n one filthy hand.
_NEWT
"Casey. She's my only friend."
_RIPLEY
"What about me?"
Newt's reply is flat, neutral.
_NEWT
"I don't want you for a friend."
_RIPLEY
"Why not?"
_NEWT 
"Because you'll be gone soon, like the others. Like everybody. You'll be dead and you'll leave me alone."
Ripley gazes at her, chilled both by the ominou tatement and by the situation which could hav roduced this outlook in a child.
_RIPLEY
"Oh, Newt. You mom and dad went away like that, didn't they?"
Newt nods, staring at her knees.
_RIPLEY
(soothingly)
"They'd be here if they could, honey. I know they would."
_NEWT
(with cold certainty)
"They're dead."
_RIPLEY
"Newt. Look at me...Newt. I won't leave you. I promise."
_NEWT
"You promise?"
_RIPLEY
"Cross my heart."
_NEWT
"And hope to die?"
Ripley smiles grimly at the inadvertently macabr xpression.
_RIPLEY
(quietly)
"And hope to die."
And because she's a child, the darkest terrors, eve he ones seen and not imagined, can still be banishe y a smile and a single promise ewt's eyes brim as she gazes at Ripley. Her lowe ip starts to tremble, and her face slowly deform nto an abject mask. She sobs as she clamps her arm round Ripley's neck. The sobs come in waves a ipley rocks her, tears of suppresses terror an rief and hurt rolling down her face. It is  reakthrough ipley closes her eyes, hoping that this promis an be kept NT.

_NEWT
"I was the best at the game. I knew the whole maze."
_RIPLEY
"The 'maze'? You mean the air ducts?"
_NEWT
"Yeah, you know. In the walls, under the floor. I was the ace. I could hide better than anybody."
_RIPLEY
"You're really something, ace."
Ripley's gaze shifts out the windshield as th rocessing station looms ahead XT. APC/STATIO he vast structure towers above the parked personne arrier. Deploying in front of the APC, backlit b ts lights, the troopers cast long shadows. The ook ominous. Hulking techno-samurai he base of the station is a depthless maze o onduits and pressure vessels, like an oil refinery r a Dantean version of one. The THRUM o unctioning machine systems echoes through th abyrinth.
_GORMAN
(voice over; static)
"Forty meters in. Ramp on axial two-two. Access to sublevels."
The troopers start down the open rampway. Ligh ilters down through several levels of steel mes loor, catwalks and pipes. Below that is darkness.
_GORMAN

"B-Level. Next one down."
The thrumming of machines grows louder as the escend NT. APC 8 uddles around the screens are Ripley, Burke an orman. Newt squeezes in from behind. Gorman i oing his video wizard bit, dancing on the buttons.

"You tell me. I only work here."
INT. COMPLE he group stands before a bizarre tableau. Amon he refinerylike lattice of pipes and conduit omething new and not of human design had bee dded t is a structure of some sort, extending from an rudely imitating the complex of plumbing, but mad f some strange encrusted substance. It vaguel esembles the chambered nests of swallows on a muc arger scale, and it attenuates so gradually int he original hardware that it is hard to see wher ne ends and the other begins he alien structure seems to extend far back int he complex of machinery. The plant thrums loudly ts functioning seemingly not impaired NT. AP ipley stares at the scene in dread fascination.

"They're right under the primary heat exchangers."
_BURKE
"Yeah? Maybe the organisms like the heat, that's why they built..."
_RIPLEY
"That's not what I mean. Gorman, if your men have to use their weapons in there, they'll rupture the cooling system."
_BURKE

"She's right."
_GORMAN
"So."

"What're we supposed to use, man? Harsh language?"
_GORMAN

_APONE
"Let's go. Pull 'em out."
He walks among the troopers, collecting the magazine rom each one's weapon asquez turns hers over reluctantly he three who are carrying them get out smal ncinerator units. When Apone moves on, Vasque lips a spare magazine from concealment and insert t in her weapon. Drake does the same. Hicks hang ack in the shadows. He opens a cylindrical sheat ttached to his battle-harness. Slides out a ld style PUMP TWELVE-GAUGE with a sawed-off but tock. Chambers a round.

_GORMAN
(voice over;
"very faint) Any movement?"
Hudson watches his tracker, scanning.
_HUDSON
"Nothing. Zip."
Apone stops, his expression changing. They face  all of living horror. The colonists have bee rought here and entombed alive.. OCOONS protrude from the niches and interstice f the structure. The cocoon material is the sam ranslucent epoxy. The bodies are frozen i arelessly twisted positions. Macabre image o rozen agony. Many are disiccated. Skeletal ip-cages burst outward, as if exploded from within aralyzed, brought here, entombed in living deat s hosts for the embryos growing within then ietrich moves close to examine one of the figures erhaps the most "recent." A WOMAN, ghost-whit nd drained. The WOMAN'S EYES SNAP OPEN...The eem to plead.
_DIETRICH
"Sir!"
The woman's lips move feebly.
_WOMAN
"Please...God...kill me."
INT. AP ipley watches the woman, white knuckled. Th ound of RETCHING comes over the general frequency NT. COCOON CHAMBER 9 he woman begins to convulse. She SCREAMS,  awing shriek of mindless agony.
_APONE
"Flame thrower! Move!"
Frost hands it to him. Suddenly, the woman's ches XPLODES in a gout of blood. A SMALL FANGED HEA MERGES, HISSING VICIOUSLY pone pulls the trigger. Then the other trooper arrying flame throwers open fire. An orgy o urging fire. The cocoons vanish in the shimmerin eat  SHRILL SCREECHING begins, like a siren made fro ingernails on blackboards NGLE ON WALL as something begins to emerge. Diml limpsed, a glistening bio-mechanoid creature large hen a man. Lying dormant, it had blended perfectl ith the convoluted surface of fused bone. Th roopers don't see it.

"Go to infrared. Looks sharp people!"
The squad members snap down their image-intersifie isors.
_HUDSON
"Multiple signals. All round. Closing."
Dietrich turns to retreat, her flamethrower hel ightly. A nightmarish silhouette materializes ou f the smoke behind her! It strikes like lightning EIZES HER. She fires reflexively, wild.

_GORMAN
"Shut up. Just shut up!"
CRASH! Crowe's telemetry cuts off like the plug wa ulled. Flat line.
_GORMAN
"Uh,...Apone, I want you to lay down a suppressing fire with the incinerators and fall back by squads to the APC, over."

Nothing. He spins. Almost blows Hudson's hea ff.
_HUDSON

"We're getting juked! We're gonna die in here!"
Apone hands him a magazine. Hudson slaps it home ooking truly terrified.
_APONE
"Yeah. Right. Right! Fuck the heat exchanger!"
He FIRES. Vasquez, nearby, is laying down  orrendous field of fire. Strobe-bright flashe ear the darkness. She pivots, firing mechanicall n controlled bursts. Scoring points in her ow rivate video game he SPINS as Hicks approached laterally. WHAM! Sh ires "at" him.

"They're but off! Do something!"
But he's gone. Total brain-lock IGHT ON RIPLEY as she struggles with a decision he's terrified...of what she knows she's about t o. But more than that, she's furious. Shoulderin ast a paralyzed Gorman she runs up the aisle of th PC.

Ripley jumps into the driver's seat of the APC. Take  deep breath. Starts slapping switches.

Burke and Hudson help him drag her from the door.

"Let's go!"
Ripley jams reverse. Nails the throttle. The AP ellows backward up the ramp. Hudson disappear nder a pile of equipment as a storage rack break ree. Hicks gets the door almost closed. Suddenl LAWS appear at the edge. Newt screams. Agains he combined efforts of Hicks, Burke and Vasque he door is being SLOWLY WRENCHED OPEN FROM OUTSIDE icks yells at a paralyzed Gorman.

"Get on the Goddamn door!"
Gorman backs away, eyes wide. Hicks jams his shoulde gainst the latching lever and frees one hand to rais is 12-gauge. An alien head wedges through the opening ts hideous mouth opening.

Its tail whips over, scorpionlike, an uries a four inch stinger in Gorman's shoulder icks grabs a joy stick at the FIRE-CONTROL CONSOL nd turns it rapidly. On the roof the alien looks u s servo-motors whir. A remote control turret cannon  20mm chain-gun, swivels toward it in a curt arc OOM.

Gorman, slumpe nconscious, is dragged back inside he APC rips away a section of catwalk and heads fo lear air, its flank trailing fire like a comet ipley fights the controls as the big machine slews roadsiding a control-room out-building. Offic urniture and splintered wall sections are strewn i he APC's wake uddenly, an alien arm arcs down, right in front o ipley's face. It smashes the windshield. Glistening ideous jaws lunge inside.. ipley recoils. Face to face once again with the sam ind-numbing horror. She reacts instinctively. Slam oth sets of brakes with all her strength. The hug heels lock. The creature flips off, landing in th eadlights. Ripley hits full throttle. The APC roar orward, smashing over the abomination. Its skeleta ody is crushed under the massive wheels. It rolls umbling...lost in the darkness behind as the machin hunders onto the causeway and away from the station  sound like bolts dropped in a meat grinder is comin rom the APC's rear end. Hicks eases Ripley's han ack on the throttle lever. Her grip is white knuckled.
_HICKS
"It's okay...we're clear. We're clear. Ease up."
The grinding clatter becomes deafening even as sh lows the machine.
_HICKS
"Sounds like a blown transaxle. You're just grinding metal."
EXT. APC 10 he tractor limps to a halt. A HALF-KILOMETER from th tmosphere processing station. The APC is a smoking cid-scarred mess NT. APC 10 ipley, still running on the adrenalin dynamo, spin ut of her seat into the aisle.
_RIPLEY
"Newt? Where's Newt?"
Feeling a tug at her pants leg she looks down. New s wedged into a tiny space between the driver's sea nd a bulkhead. She is trembling, and looks terrified ut it's not the basket case catatonia of before.
_RIPLEY
"You okay?"
Newt gives her a THUMBS-UP, wan but stoic. Ripley goe ack to the others. Hudson is holding his arm an taring in stunned dismay at nothing, playing it al ack in his mind.
_HUDSON
"Jesus...Jesus...I don't believe it."
Burke tries to have a look at Hudson's arm.
_HUDSON
(jerking away)
"I'm all right, leave it!"
Ripley joins Hicks who is bent over Gorman, checkin or a pulse.
_HICKS
"He's alive. I think he's paralyzed."
_VASQUEZ
"He's fucking dead!"
She grabs Gorman by the collar, hauling him up roughly eady to pulp him with her other fist.
_VASQUEZ
(to Gorman)
"Wake up pendejo! I'm gonna kill you, you useless fuck!"
Hicks pushes her back. Right in her face.
_HICKS
"Hold it. Hold it. Back off, right now."
Vasquez releases Gorman. His head smacks the deck ipley opens Gorman's tunic, revealing a bloodles urple puncture wound.
_RIPLEY
"Looks like it stung him."
_HUDSON
"Hey...hey! Look, Crowe and Dietrich aren't dead, man."
They turn to see Hudson at the MTOB monitors, pointin t the bio-function screens.
_HUDSON
"They must be like Gorman. Their signs are real low but they ain't dead!"
Hudson is pale, panicky, and his voice echoes aroun he tiny metallic space and comes back to all of the s the near hysteria they all feel, fluttering jus t the edges of their minds.
_RIPLEY
"You can't help them. Right now they're being cocooned just like the others."
_HUDSON

"Oh, God. Jesus. This ain't happening."
Ripley and Vasquez lock eyes. Ripley doesn't wan t to be "I told you so" but Vasquez reads it tha ay. She turns away with a snap NT.

_HUDSON
"Look, man, let's just bug out and call it even, okay?"
_RIPLEY
(to Vasquez)
"No good. How do we know it'll effect their biochemistry? I say we take off and nuke the entire site from orbit. It's the only way to be sure."
_BURKE
"Now hold on a second. I'm not authorizing that action."
_RIPLEY
"Why not?"
Burke senses the challenge in her tone and backpedal lawlessly into conciliatory mode.
_BURKE
"Well, I mean...I know this is an emotional moment, but let's not make snap judgments. Let's move cautiously. First, this physical installation had a substantial dollar value attached to it --"
_RIPLEY
"They can bill me. I got a tab running. What's second?"
_BURKE
"This is clearly an important species we're dealing with here. We can't just arbitrarily exterminate them --"
_RIPLEY
"Bullshit!"
_VASQUEZ
"Yeah, bullshit. Watch us."
_HUDSON
"Maybe you haven't been keeping up on current events, but we just got out asses kicked, pal!"
Ripley faces Burke squarely and she's not pleased.
_RIPLEY
"Look, Burke. We had an agreement."
Burke moves in, lowering his voice. He takes her asid rom the others.
_BURKE
"I know, I know, but we're dealing with changing scenarios here. This thing is major, Ripley. I mean really major. You gotta go with its energy. Since you are the representative of the company who discovered this species your percentage will naturally be some serious, serious money."
Ripley stares at his like he's a particularl isagreeable fungus.
_RIPLEY
"You son of a bitch."
_BURKE
(hardening)
"Don't make me pull rank, Ripley."
_RIPLEY
"What rank? I believe Corporal Hicks has authority here."
_BURKE
"Corporal Hicks!?"
_RIPLEY
"This operation is under military jurisdiction and Hicks is next in chain of command. Right?"
_HICKS
"Looks that way."
Burke starts to lose it and it's not a pretty sight.
_BURKE
"Look, this is a multimillion dollar operation. He can't make that kind of decision. He's just a grunt!"

_HICKS
"Prep for dust-off. We're gonna need an immediate evac."

"I think we'll take off and nuke the site from orbit. It's the only way to be sure."
He winks. Burke looks like a kid whose toy has bee natched.
_BURKE
"This is absurd! You don't have the authority to --"
CLACK! The sound of a rifle bolt snapping hom runcates his rant. Vasquez has a pulse-rifle cradled ot exactly aimed at Burke but not exactly aimed awa ither. Her expression is masklike. End of discussion ipley sits behind Newt, putting her arm around her.

The compartment door behind her slides slowly back.

Her eyes widen. It's not Spunkmeyer m impression of leering jaws which blur forward, the  whirl of motion and a truncated scream. The throttl evers are slammed forward in the melee XT. APC - LANDSCAPE - STATIO hey watch in dismay as the approaching ship dips an EERS WILDLY. Its main engines ROAR FULL ON and th raft accelerates toward them even as it loses altitude t skims the ground. Clips a rock formation. Th hip slews, sideslipping. It hits a ridge. Tumbles ursting into flame, breaking up. It arcs into th ir, end over end, a Catherine wheel juggernaut.
_RIPLEY
"Run!"
She grabs Newt and sprints for cover as a tumblin ection of the ship's massive engine module slam nto the APC and it explodes into twisted wreckage he drop-ship skips again, like a stone, engulfed i lames...AND CRASHES INTO THE STATION. A TREMENDOU IREBALL he remainder of the ground team watches their hope f getting off the planet, and most of their superio ire power, reduced to flaming debris here is a moment of stunned silence, then...
_HUDSON
(hysterical)
"Well that's great! That's just fucking great, man. Now what the fuck are we supposed to do, man? We're in some real pretty shit now!"
_HICKS
"Are you finished?"
(to Ripley)
"You okay?"
She nods. She can't disguise her stricken expressio hen she looks at Newt, but the little girl seem elatively calm. She shrugs with fatalistic acceptance.
_NEWT
"I guess we're not leaving, right?"
_RIPLEY
"I'm sorry, Newt."
_NEWT
"You don't have to be sorry. It wasn't your fault."
_HUDSON

"Just tell me what the fuck we're supposed to do now. What're we gonna do now?"
_BURKE
(annoyed)
"May be could build a fire and sing songs."
_NEWT
"We should get back, 'cause it'll be dark soon. They come mostly at night. Mostly."
Ripley follows Newt's look to the AP station loomin n the twilight, the burning drop-ship wreckage jamme nto its basal structure XT. CONTROL BLOCK - NIGH he wind howls mournfully around the metal buildings ry and cold NT. OPERATION he weary and demoralized group is gathered to tak tock of their grim options. Vasquez and Hudson ar ust setting down a scorched and dented packing case ne of several culled from the APC wreckage icks indicates their remaining inventory of weapons ying on a table.
_HICKS
"This is all we could salvage. We've got four pulse-rifles with about fifty rounds each. Not so good. About fifteen M-40 grenades and two flame throwers less than half full...one damaged. And We've got four of these robot-sentry units with scanners and display intact."
He opens one of the scorched cases, revealing  igh-tech servo-actuated machine gun with optica ensing equipment, packed in foam.
_RIPLEY
"How long after we're declared overdue can we expect a rescue?"
_HICKS
"About seventeen days."
_HUDSON
"Man, we're not going to make it seventeen hours! Those things are going to come in here, just like they did before, man... they're going to come in here and get us, man, long before..."
_RIPLEY
"She survived longer than that with no weapons and no training."
Ripley indicates Newt, who salutes Hudson smartly.
_RIPLEY
"So you better just start dealing with it. Just deal with it, Hudson...because we need you and I'm tired of your bullshit. Now get on a terminal and call up some kind of floor plan file. Construction blueprints, maintenance schematics, anything that shows the layout of this place. I want to see air ducts, electrical access tunnels, subbasements. Every possible way into this wing."
Hudson gathers himself, thankful for the direction icks nods approval of her handling of it.
_HUDSON
"Aye-firmative. I'm on it."
_BISHOP
"I'll be in medical. I'd like to continue my analysis."
_RIPLEY
"Fine. You do that."
INT. OPERATION urke, Ripley, Hudson and Hicks are bent over a larg ORIZONTAL VIDEOSCREEN, like an illuminated chart table ewt hops from one foot to the other to see.
_RIPLEY
"This service tunnel is how they're moving back and forth."
_HUDSON
"Yeah, right, it runs from the processing station right into the sublevel here."
He traces a finger along the abstract ground plan.
_RIPLEY
"All right. There's a fire door at this end. The first thing we do is put a remote sentry in the tunnel and seal that door."
_HICKS
"We gotta figure on them getting into the complex."
_RIPLEY
"That's right. So we put up welded barricades at these intersections..."
(pointing)
 ...and seal these ducts here
"and here. Then they can only come at us from these two corridors and we create a free field of fire for the other two sentry units, here."
Hicks contemplates her game plan and raises his hand atisfied.
_HICKS
"Outstanding. Then all we need's a deck of cards. All right, let's move like we got a purpose."
_HUDSON
"Aye-firmative."
_NEWT
(imitating Hudson)
"Aye-firmative!"
INT. SERVICE TUNNEL - SUBLEVE  long straight service tunnel, lined with conduit eems to go on forever. Vasquez and Hudson hav inished setting up two of the robot sentry guns o ripods in the tunnel.
_VASQUEZ
(shouting)
"Testing!"
She hurls a wastebasket down the tunnel, into th utomatic field of fire. The sentry guns swive moothly, the wastebasket bounces once...and is riddle y two quick bursts of EXPLODING 10MM ROUNDS int ime-sized shrapnel. They retreat behind a heavy stee IRE DOOR which they roll closed on its track. Vasquez sing a PORTABLE WELDING TORCH, begins sealing the doo o its frame, as Hudson paces nervously.
_HUDSON
"Hudson here. A and B sentries are in place and keyed. We're sealing the tunnel."
INT. SECOND LEVEL CORRIDO icks pauses in his work.
_HICKS

"Roger."
He and Ripley are covering an air duct opening wit  metal plate, welding it in place, showering spark n the dark corridor. Behind them Burke and New re moving back and forth with cartons of food on  and truck, stacking it inside the operations center icks sets down his welder and pulls a small objec ut of a belt pouch. A braceletlike EMERGENC OCATING BEEPER.
_HICKS
"Here, put this on. Then I can locate you anywhere in the complex on this --"
He indicates a tiny TRACKER hooked to his battl arness. He shrugs, a little self-consciously.
_HICKS
"Just a...precaution. You know."
Ripley pauses for a moment, regarding hi uizzically.
_RIPLEY
(strapping
"it on) Thanks."
_HUDSON
"Uh, what's next?"
She consults a printout of the floor plan XT. CONTROL BLOCK 12 he wind has died utterly and in the even more eeri tillness a diffuse mist has rolled into shrou he complex. Visibility is low in the fog verything looks underwater. There is no movement NT. CORRIDO n the barricaded corridor sentry-gun "C" sits waiting ts "ARMED" light flashing green. Through a hol orn in the ceiling at the far end of the corrido he fog swirls in. Water drips. An expectant hush NT. MED LAB ANNEX - OPERATING ROO ipley carries an exhausted Newt through the inne onnecting rooms of the medical wing. She reache n OPERATING ROOM which is small but very high-tec ..vaultlike metal walls, strange equipment everal metal cots have been set up, displacing O.R quipment which is pushed into one corner ewt is resting her head on Ripley's shoulder, barel wake...out of steam. Ripley sets her on one o he cots and Newt lies down.
_RIPLEY
"Now you just lie here and have a nap. You're exhausted."
_NEWT
"I don't want to...I have scary dreams."
This obviously strikes a chord with Ripley, but sh eigns cheerfulness.
_RIPLEY
"I'll bet Casey doesn't have bad dreams."
Ripley lifts the doll's head from Newt's tiny finger nd looks inside. It is, of course, empty.
_RIPLEY
"Nothing bad in here. Maybe you could just try to be like her."
Ripley closes the doll's eyes and hands her back ewt rolls her eyes as if to say "don't pull tha ive-year-old shit on me, lady. I'm six."
_NEWT
"Ripley...she doesn't have bad dreams because she's just a piece of plastic."
_RIPLEY
"Oh. Sorry, Newt."
_NEWT
"My mommy always said there were no monsters. No real ones. But there are."
Ripley's expression becomes sober. She brushes dam air back from the child's pale forehead.
_RIPLEY
(quietly)
"Yes, there are, aren't there."
_NEWT
"Why do they tell little kids that?"
Newt's voice reveals her deep sense of betrayal he's seen that the world can be just as terrifyin s her most primal child's nightmare if not mor o, and that's a lot worse than finding out there i o Santa.
_RIPLEY
"Well, some kids can't handle it like you can."
_NEWT
"Did one of those things grow inside her?"
Ripley begins pulling blankets up an tucking them i round her tiny body.
_RIPLEY
"I don't know, Newt. That's the truth."
_NEWT
"Isn't that how babies come? I mean people babies...they grow inside you?"
_RIPLEY
"No, it's different, honey."
_NEWT
"Did you ever have a baby?"
_RIPLEY
"Yes. A little girl."
_NEWT
"Where is she?"
_RIPLEY
(quietly)
"Gone."
_NEWT
"You mean dead."
It's more statement than question. Ripley nods slowly he turns, reaching for a PORTABLE SPACE HEATE itting nearby, and slides it closer to the bed. Sh witches it on. It HUMS and emits a cozy orang low.
_NEWT
"Ripley, I was just thinking... Maybe I could do you a favor and fill in for her. Just for a while. You can try it and if you don't like it, it's okay. I'll understand. No big deal. Whattya think?"
Ripley gazes at her a long time before answering..  conflict between the urge to crush the child to he n a forever hug and the knowledge that neither of the ay see another dawn.
_RIPLEY
"I think it's not the worst idea I've heard all day. Let's talk about it later."
She switches off the light and starts to rise. New rabs her arm. A plaintive voice in the dark.
_NEWT
"Don't go! Please."
_RIPLEY
"I'll be right in the other room, Newt. And look...I can see you on that camera right up there."
Newt looks at the VIDEO SECURITY CAMERA above the door ipley unsnaps the TRACKER BRACELET given to her b icks and puts it on Newt's tiny wrist, cinching i own.
_RIPLEY
"Here. Take is for luck. Now go to sleep...and don't dream."
Ripley walks away and Newt rolls on her side, huggin asey and gazing at the hypnotically pulsing functio ight on the bracelet. The space heater hum omfortingly NT. MED LA CU Gorman, his eyelids slitted open like those of  orpse, but with the eyes tracking erratically. Th nly sign of life.
_RIPLEY
(voice over)
"How is he?"
Ripley stands over the Lieutenant, who is lyin otionless on an examining table. Bishop looks u rom his instruments nearby, the light of a singl ooseneck lamp giving his features a macabre cast.
_BISHOP
"I've isolated a neuro-muscular toxin responsible for the paralysis. It seems to be metabolizing. He should wake up soon."
_RIPLEY
"Now let me get this straight. The aliens paralyzed the colonists, carried them over there, cocooned them to be hosts for more of those..."
Ripley points at the stasis cylinders containing th ace-hugger specimens.
_RIPLEY
"Which would mean lots of those parasites, right? One for each person...over a hundred at least."
_BISHOP
"Yes. That follows."
_RIPLEY
"But these things come from eggs...so where are all the eggs coming from."
_BISHOP
"That is the question of the hour. We could assume a parallel to certain insect forms who have hivelike organization. An ant of termite colony, for example, is ruled by a single female, a queen, which is the source of new eggs."
_RIPLEY
"You're saying one of those things lays all the eggs?"
_BISHOP
"Well, the queen is always physically larger then the others. A termite queen's abdomen is so bloated with eggs that it can't move at all. It is fed and tended by drone workers, defended by the warriors. She is the center of their lives, quite literally the mother of their society."
_RIPLEY
"Could it be intelligent?"
_BISHOP
"Hard to say. It may have been blind instinct...attraction to the heat of whatever...but she did choose to incubate her eggs in the one spot where we couldn't destroy her without destroying ourselves. That's if she exists, of course."
Ripley ponders the ramifications of Bishop's analysis.
_RIPLEY
(rising)
"I want those specimens destroyed as soon as you're done with them. You understand?"
Bishop glances at the creatures, pulsing malevolentl n their cylinders.
_BISHOP
"Mr. Burke have instructions that they were to be kept alive in stasis for return to the company labs. He was very specific."
Ripley feels the fabric of her self-restraint tearing he slaps the intercom switch.
_RIPLEY
"Burke!"
INT. MED LAB ANNE n a small observation chamber separated from the me ab by a glass partition, Ripley and Burke hav quared off.
_BURKE
"Those specimens are worth millions to the bio-weapons division. Now, if you're smart we can both come out of this heroes. Set up for life."
_RIPLEY
"You just try getting a dangerous organism past ICC quarantine. Section 22350 of the Commerce Code."
_BURKE
"You've been doing your homework. Look, they can't impound it if they don't know about it."
_RIPLEY
"But they will know about it, Burke. From me. Just like they'll know how you were responsible for the deaths of one hundred and fifty-seven colonists here --"
_BURKE
"Now, wait a second --"
_RIPLEY
(stepping on him)
"You sent them to that ship. I just checked the colony log... directive dates six-twelve-seventy-nine. Signed Burke, Carter J."
Ripley's fury is peaking, now that the frustration an age finally have a target to focus on.
_RIPLEY
"You sent them out there and you didn't even warn them, Burke. Why didn't you warn them?"
_BURKE
"Look, maybe the thing didn't even exist, right? And if I'd made it a major security situation, the Administration would've stepped in. Then no exclusive rights, nothing."
He shrugs, his manner blase, dismissive.
_BURKE
"It was a bad call, that's all."
Ripley snaps. She slams him against the wall, surprisin erself and him, her hands gripping his collar.
_RIPLEY
"Bad call? These people are fucking dead, Burke! Well, they're going to nail your hide to the shed... and I'll be there when they do."
She steps back, shaking, and looks at him with utte oathing, as if the depths of human greed are a fa ore horrific revelation than any alien.
_BURKE
(sadly)
"I expected more of you, Ripley. I thought you would be smarter than this."
_RIPLEY
"Sorry to disappoint you."
She turns away and strides out. The door closes urke stares after her, his mind a whirl of options NT. CORRIDO ipley is walking toward operations when a STRIDEN LARM begins to sound. She breaks into a run NT. OPERATION ipley double-times it to Hicks' TACTICAL CONSOL here Hudson and Vasquez have already gathered. Hick laps a switch, killing the alarm.
_HICKS
"They're coming. They're in the tunnel."
The TRILLING of the motion sensor remains, speeding up WO RED LIGHTS on the tactical display light u imultaneously with an echoing crash of gunfire whic ibrates the floor.
_HICKS
"Guns A and B. Tracking and firing on multiple targets."
The RSS guns pound away, echoing through the complex heir separate bursts overlap in an irregular rhythm  counter on the display counts down the number o ounds fired.
_HUDSON
"They must be wall to wall in there. Look at those ammo counters go. It's a shooting gallery down there."
INT. SERVICE TUNNEL - TIGHT ON RSS GUN lasting stroboscopically in the tunnels. Their barrel re overheating, glowing cherry red. One CLICKS empt nd sits smoking, still swiveling to track targets i an't fire upon NT. OPERATION he digital counter on B gun reads zero.

"B gun's dry. Twenty on A. Ten. Five. That's it."
SILENCE. Then a GONGLIKE BOOMING echoes eerily up fro ublevel.
_RIPLEY
"They're at the fire door."
The BOOMING INCREASES in volume and ferocity.
_HUDSON
"Man, listen to that."
Mixed with the echoing crash-clang is a nerve-wreckin CREECH of claws on steel. The intercom buzzes tartling them.
_BISHOP

"Bishop here. I'm afraid I have some bad news."
_HUDSON
"Well, that's a switch."
INT. OPERATIONS - MINUTES LATE veryone, including Bishop, is crowded at the window ntently watching the AP station which is a di ilhouette in the mist. Suddenly a column of flame ike an acetylene torch, jets upward from the comple t the base of the cone.
_BISHOP
"That's it. See it? Emergency venting."
_RIPLEY
"How long until it blows?"
_BISHOP
"I'm projecting total systems failure in a little under four hours. The blast radius will be about thirty kilometers. About equal to ten megatons."
_HICKS
"We got problems."
_HUDSON
"I don't fucking believe this. Do you believe this?"
_RIPLEY
"And it's too late to shut it down?"
_BISHOP
"I'm afraid so. The crash did too much damage. The overload is inevitable, at this point."
_HUDSON
"Oh, man. And I was gettin' short, too! Four more weeks and out. Now I'm gonna buy it on this fuckin' rock. It ain't half fair, man!"
_VASQUEZ
"Hudson, give us a break."
They watch as another gas jet lights up the fog-shroude andscape.
_RIPLEY
(to Hicks)
"We need the other drop-ship. The on one the Sulaco. We have to bring it down on remote, somehow."
_HUDSON
"How? The transmitter was on the APC. It's wasted."
_RIPLEY
(pacing)
"I don't care how! Think of a way. Think of something."
_HUDSON
"Think of what? We're fucked."
_RIPLEY
"What about the colony transmitter? That up-link tower down at the other end. Why can't we use that?"
_BISHOP
"I checked. The hard wiring between here and there was severed in the fighting."
Ripley is wound up like a dynamo, her mind spinning ou ptions, grim solutions.
_RIPLEY
"Well then somebody's just going to have to go out there. Take a portable terminal and go out there and plug in manually."
_HUDSON
"Oh, right! Right! With those things running around. No way."
_BISHOP
(quietly)
"I'll go."
_RIPLEY
"What?"
_BISHOP
"I'm really the only one qualified to remote-pilot the ship anyway. Believe me, I'd prefer not to. I may be synthetic but I'm not stupid."
_RIPLEY
"All right. Let's get on it. What'll you need?"
_VASQUEZ
"Listen. It's stopped."
They listen. Nothing. An instant later comes th IGH-PITCHED TRILLING of a motion-sensor alarm. Hick ooks at the tactical board.
_HICKS
"Well, they're into the complex."
INT. MED LAB 13 ne of the acid holes from the colonists' siege ha ielded access to subfloor conduits. Bishop lying i he opening, reaches up to graph the portable termina s Ripley hands it down to him. He pushes it int he constricted shaft ahead of him. She then hands hi  small satchel containing tools and assorted patc ables, a service pistol and a small cutting torch.
_BISHOP
"This duct runs almost to the up-link assembly. One hundred eighty meters. Say, forty minutes to crawl down there. One hour to patch in and align the antenna. Thirty minutes to prep the ship, then about fifty minutes flight time."
Ripley looks at her watch.
_RIPLEY
"It's going to be closer. You better get going."
_BISHOP
(cheerfully)
"See you soon."
She squirms into the shaft, pushing the equipment alon head of him with a scraping rhythm. The diameter o he conduit is barely larger than the width of hi houlders. Vasquez slides a metal plate over the hol nd begins spot welding it in place NT. CONDUI ishop looks back as the welder seals him in. He sigh atalistically and squirms forward. Ahead of him th onduit dwindles straight to seeming infinity. Lik eing in the bore of a very long Howitzer NT. MED LA ipley jumps as an ALARM suddenly blares through th omplex.
_HICKS

"They're in the approach corridor."
_RIPLEY

"On my way."
Ripley jumps up, unslinging a FLAMETHROWER from he houlder in one motion, and sprints for Operations wit asquez. The sound of SENTRY GUNS opening up i taccato bursts echoes from close by NT. OPERATION ipley runs to the tactical console where Hicks i esmerized by the images from the surveillance cameras he flashes of the sentry guns flare out the sensitiv ideo, but impressions of figures moving in the smok orridor are occasionally visible. The robot sentrie ammer away, driving streamers of tracer fire int he swirling mist.
_HICKS
"Twenty meters and closing. Fifteen. C and D guns down about fifty percent."
The digital readout whirl through descending numbers n inhuman SHRILL SCREECHING is audible between burst f fire.
_RIPLEY
"Now many?"
_HICKS
"Can't tell. Lots. D gun's down to twenty. Ten. It's out."
Then the firing from the remaining guns stop abruptly he video image is a swirling wall of smoke. Small fire urn, dim glows in the mist. There are black an wisted shapes, and pieces of twisted shapes, scattere t the edge of visibility. However, nothing emerge rom the wall of smoke. The motion sensor TONE shuts off.
_RIPLEY
"They retreated. The guns stopped them."
The moment stretches. Everyone exhales slowly.
_HICKS
"Yeah. But look..."
The digital counters for the two sentry guns read "0 nd "10" respectively. Less than a second's worth o iring.
_HICKS
"Newt time then can walk right up and knock."
_RIPLEY
"But they don't know that. They're probably looking for other ways to get in. That'll take them awhile."
_HUDSON
"Maybe we got 'em demoralized."
_HICKS
(to Vasquez
"and Hudson) I want you two walking the perimeter. I know we're all in strung out shape but stay frosty and alert. We've got to stop any entries before they get out of hand."
The two troopers nod and head for the corridor. Riple ighs and picks up a cup of cold coffee, draining it i ne gulp.
_HICKS
"How long since you slept? Twenty-four hours?"
Ripley shrugs. She seems soul weary, drained by th erve-wracking tension. When she answers, her voic eems distant, detached.
_RIPLEY
(grimly)
"They'll get us."
_HICKS
"Maybe. Maybe not."

"Hicks, I'm not going to wind up like those others. You'll take care of it won't you, it if comes to that?"
_HICKS
"If it comes to that, I'll do us both. Let's see that it doesn't Here, I'd like to introduce you to a close personal friend of mine."
He picks up his pulse-rifle and with the casually precis ovements of long practice he snaps open the bolt, drop ut the magazine and hands it to her.
_HICKS
"M-41A 10mm pulse-rifle, over and under with a 30mm pump-action grenade launcher."
Ripley hefts the weapon. It is heavy and awkward. Bu here is an irrational promise of security in its letha old steel lines, to at least the sense that she wil e in some greater measure the master of her own fate he raises it clumsily.

"Just pull it in real right. It will kick some. When the counter here heads zero, hit this..."
He thumbs a button and the magazine drops out, clatterin n the floor.
_HICKS
"Just let it drop right out. Get the other one in quick. Just slap it in hard, it likes abuse. Now, pull the bolt."
CLACK.

"You're ready again."
Ripley repeats the action, not very smoothly. Her hand re trembling. She indicates a stout TUBE underneat he slender pulse-rifle barrel.

Sh lips it over, trapping the creature underneath hey back away, gasping. Ripley's eyes flash aroun he shadowed room where every corner of spac etween equipment holds lethal promise. The creatur cuttles from beneath the bed and disappears under  ack of cabinets in a blur. Ripley hugs Newt clos nd heads toward the door, moving as if every object i he room had a million volts running through it. Sh eaches the door. Hits the wall switch. Nothin appens. Disabled from outside. She tries the lights othing. She pounds on the door. The acousticall ampened door panel thunks dully. She moves to th bservation window, glancing frantically over he houlder. The bare floor behind her is like a screamin hreat.
_RIPLEY
(shouting)
"Hey...hey!"
She pounds on the window. Through the doubl hickness window we can SEE that the lab is dark an mpty. Ripley whirls, hearing a loathsome scrabblin ehind her. Newt starts to whimper, feeding off he ear. She steps in front of the video surveillanc amera and waves her arms in a circle.
_RIPLEY
"Hicks! Hicks!"
INT. OPERATIONS - TIGHT ON VIDEO MONITO howing Ripley waving her arms. There is no sound  surreal pantomime  hand ENTERS FRAME and switches off the monitor ipley's image vanishes IDER ANGLE as Burke straightens casually fro he console. Hicks is talking via headset wit ishop and hasn't noticed Ripley's plight o urke's action.
_HICKS
(into mike)
"Roger. Check back when you've activated the ship."
(turning)
"He's at the up-link tower."
_BURKE
(calmly)
"Excellent."
INT. OPERATING ROO ipley picks up a steel chair and slams it agains he observation window. It bounces back from th igh-impact material. She tries again EVERSE ANGLE from the med lab side, showing he utile efforts, the chair hitting with a dull THWAC arely audible through the double thickness pressur ort ipley turns, studying the room. She fumbles throug  clutter of equipment on a counter next to her an inds a SMALL EXAMINATION LIGHT. Snapping it on sh lays the beam over the walls. Tall assemblies o urgical and anaethesiology equipment loom in th ark. She hears, ot thinks she hears, movements. Th ight spins across the room, swiveling and bobbin rantically. Like an indicator of her growing panic ewt starts a thin, high wailing.
_NEWT
"Mommy...mommmyyyyy..."
Ripley steadies herself, realizing Newt's terror an he child's dependence on her. She plays the bea cross the ceiling. Holds on something. Gets an idea he removes her lighter from a jacket pocket and pick p some papers from the counter. Moving cautiousl he boosts Newt up onto the SURGICAL TABLE in the cente f the room and clambers up after her.
_NEWT
"Mommy...I mean, Ripley...I'm scared."
_RIPLEY
"I know, honey. Me too."
Ripley lights the papers and holds the flaming mas nder the temperature sensor of a fire control syste PRINKLER HEAD. It triggers, spraying the room fro everal sources with water. An ALARM sounds throughou he complex NT. OPERATION icks jumps at the sound of the alarm, finall dentifying its source among the lights flashing o is board. He bolts for the door, yelling into hi eadset as he moves.
_HICKS
"Vasquez, Hudson, meet me in medical! We got a fire!"
INT. OPERATING ROO ipley and Newt are drenched as the sprinkler ontinue to drizzle in the darkness. The SIRE oots maniacally, masking all other sound. Riple cans the room with her light, her hair plastere o her face, wiping water out of her eyes. She i ye level with a complex surgical MULTILIGHT. Sh ooks into its tangle of arms and cables, inches away ooks away. Her eyes snap back. SOMETHING LEAPS A ER FACE. She SCREAMS and topples off the table plashing to the floor. Newt shrieks and scramble way as Ripley hurls the CHITTERING creature off o er. It slams against a wall of cabinets, cling or a moment, then leaps back as if driven by  teel spring. Ripley scrambles desperately, pullin quipment over on top of herself, clawing across th loor in a frenzy of motion. In a blurr o ultijointed legs the creature scuttles up her body he tears at it, but it is incredibly powerful fo ts size. It moves like lightning toward her head voiding her fumbling hands. Newt screams abjectly acking away, until she is pressed up against  esk in one corner ipley has both hands up, forcing the pulsing bod ack from her face. The thing's tail whips aroun er throat and begins to tighten, forcing the undersid f its body close to her. Ripley thrashes about nocking over equipment, sending instruments CLATTERING ater streams over her, into her eyes, blinding he nd making it impossible to get a grip on the creature' ody NGLE ON NEWT as crablike legs appear from behind th esk, right behind her. She sees it and, thinkin ast, jams the desk against the wall, pinning th rithing thing. The desk jumps and shudders agains ll the pressure her tiny body can bring to bear on it he wails between gritted teeth as the second creatur ets one leg free, then another and another. Squeezin tself inexorably onto the desk top...toward her he legs of the chittering thing claw at Ripley' ead, getting a surer grip even as she whips her hea rom side to side. The obscene TUBULE extrudes wetl rom the sheath on the creature's underside, forcin tself between the arms she has crossed tightly ove er face  figure appears at the observation window, a silhouett ehind the misted-over glass. A hand wipes a clear spot ick's eyes appear. He steps back. WHAM! A burst o ulse-rifle fire shatters the tempered glass. Hick ives into the crazed spider web pattern and explode nto the room in a shower of fragments. He hit olling, his armor grinding through the shards, an lides across to Ripley. He gets his fingers around th hrashing legs of the vicious beast and pulls. Betwee he two of them they force is away from her face hough Ripley is losing strength as the tail tighten ickeningly around her throat. Hudson leaps into th oom, flings Newt away from the desk to go skiddin cross the wet floor, and blasts the second creatur gainst the wall. Point-blank. Acid and smoke orman appears at Ripley's side and grabs the tail nwinding its writhing length like a boa constricto oil from her throat. All of them grip the struggling HRIEKING creature.
_HICKS
"The corner! Ready?"
_HUDSON
"Do it!"
Hicks hurls the thing into the corner. It scrabble pright in an instant and leaps back toward them HAM! Hudson gets it clean ipley collapses, gagging. The alarm and sprinkler hut off automatically. Hicks sees the stasi ylinders.
_RIPLEY
(coughing)
"Burke...it was Burke."
INT. OPERATIONS - ANGLE ON HUDSO ooking decidedly stressed-out. He grips his rifl ightly, AIMED RIGHT AT CAMERA.
_HUDSON
(intense)
"I say we grease this rat-fuck son of a bitch right now!"
THE GROUP is gathered around Burke who sits in  hair, maintaining an icy calm although beads o weat betray intense concealed tension. Only a fe inutes have passes and everyone is still buzzed o drenaline, as if the whole group is charged wit igh voltage.
_HICKS
(pacing)
"I don't get it. It doesn't make any Goddamn sense."
Ripley stands in front of Burke, every fiber o er being accusing him with absolute outrage. Burk ries to break Ripley's stare, which is like  iamond drill. He can't.
_RIPLEY
"He wanted an alien, only he couldn't get it back through quarantine. But if we were impregnated"
 ...whatever you call it...and then
"frozen for the trip back at just the right time...then nobody would know about the embryos we were carrying. We and Newt."
Ripley glances at the little girl, a frail figur itting nearby, hugging her knees and watching th roceedings with somber eyes. She is all but lost i n adult jacket someone has found for her, and her stil amp hair is plastered to her forehead and cheeks.
_HICKS
"Wait a minute. We'd know about it."
_RIPLEY
"The only way it would work is if he sabotaged certain freezers on the trip back. Then he could jettison the bodies and make up any story he liked."
_HUDSON
"Fuuuck! He's dead."
(to Burke)
"You're dogmeat, pal."
_BURKE
"This is total paranoid delusion. It's pitiful."
_RIPLEY
(wearily)
"You know, Burke, I don't know which species is worse. You don't see them screwing each other over for a fucking percentage."
_HICKS
(serious)
"Let's waste him."
(to Burke)
"No offense."
Ripley shakes her head, the rage giving way to  ickened emptiness.
_RIPLEY
"Just find someplace to lock him up until it's time to --"
THE LIGHTS GO OUT. Everyone stops in the sudden darkness ealizing instinctively it is a new escalation in th truggle. Hicks looks at the board. Everything is out oors. Video screens.
_RIPLEY
"They cut the power."
_HUDSON
"What do you mean, they cut the power? How could they cut the power, man? They're animals."
Ripley picks up her rifle and thumbs off the safety.
_RIPLEY
"Newt! Stay close."
(to the others)
"Let's get some trackers going. Come on, get moving. Gorman, watch Burke."
Hudson and Vasquez pick up their scanners and move t he door. Vasquez has to slide it open manually on it rack NT. CORRIDO he two troopers separate and move rapidly to th arriers at opposite ends of the control block OLLYING WITH VASQUEZ as she moves forward with fera teps in the darkness N HUDSON scanning the med lab and the nearby barrier.
_RIPLEY
(voice over)
"Anything?"
BEEP. Hudson's tracker lights up, a faint signal.
_HUDSON
"There's something."
He pans it around. Back down the corridor. It bee gain, louder.
_HUDSON
"It's inside the complex."
_VASQUEZ
(voice over)
"You're just reading me."
_HUDSON
"No. No! It ain't you. They're inside. Inside the perimeter. They're in here."
_RIPLEY
"Hudson, stay cool. Vasquez?"
ANGLE ON VASQUEZ swinging her tracker and rifle together he aims it behind her. BEEP.
_VASQUEZ
(cool)
"Hudson may be right."
INT. OPERATION ipley and Hicks share a look..."here we go."
_HICKS
(low)
"It's game time."
_RIPLEY
"Get back here, both of you. Fall back to Operations."
INT. CORRIDO udson backtracks nervously, peering all around. H ooks stretched to the limit.
_HUDSON
"This signal's weird...must be some interference or something. There's movement all over the place..."
_RIPLEY
(voice over)
"Just get back here!"
Hudson reaches the door to operations at a run,  oment before Vasquez. They pull the door shut an ock it NT. OPERATIONS 15 udson joins Ripley and Hicks, who are laying out thei rmament. Flamethrowers. Grenades. M-41A magazines udson's tracker beeps. Then again. The tone continue hrough the SCENE, its rhythm increasing.
_HUDSON
"Movement! Signal's clean."
He pans the scanner. Stops. The range display read ut, counting down.
_HUDSON
"Range twenty meters."
_RIPLEY
(to Vasquez)
"Seal the door."
Vasquez picks up a hand-welder and moves to comply.
_HUDSON
"Seventeen meters."
_HICKS
"Let's get these things lit."
He hands one flamethrower to RIpley and begins primin he other himself. It lights with a muffled POP ipley's lights a moment later. Sparks shower aroun asquez as she begins welding the door. Hudson's tracke s beeping like mad now, as fast as their hearts.
_RIPLEY
"They learned. They cut the power and avoided the guns. They must have found another way in, something we missed."
_HICKS
"We didn't miss anything."
_HUDSON
"Fifteen meters."
_RIPLEY
"I don't know, an acid hole in a duct. Something under the floors, not on the plans. I don't know!"
She picks up Vasquez' scanner and aims it the sam irection as Hudson's.
_HUDSON
"Twelve meters. Man, this is a big fucking signal. Ten meters."
_RIPLEY
"They're right on us. Vasquez, how you doing?"
Vasquez is heedlessly showering herself with molten meta s she welds the door shut. Working like a demon.
_HUDSON
"Nine meters. Eight."
_RIPLEY
"Can't be. That's inside the room!"
_HUDSON
"It's readin' right. Look!"
Ripley fiddles with her tracker, adjusting the tuning.
_HICKS
"Well you're not reading it right!"
_HUDSON
"Six meters. Five. What the fu --"
He looks at Ripley. It dawns on both of them at the sam ime. She feels a cold premonitory dread as she angle er tracker upward to the ceiling, almost overhead. Th one gets louder icks climbs onto a file cabinet and raises a panel o coustic drop-ceiling. He shines his light inside ICKS' P.O.V  soul-wrenching nightmare image. Moving in the beam o ight are aliens. Lots of aliens. They are crawlin ike bats, upside down, clinging to the pipes and beam f the structural ceiling, not touching the flims coustic panels. They glisten hideously as they cla heir way forward in silence. They cover the ceilin f the operations room. The inner sanctum is utterl iolated N HICK lasted by fear omething moves...he snaps the light around. It's  eter behind him. IT LUNGES! He drops reflexively he claws raking across his armor icks falls into the room just as the creatures detac n masse from the handholds. THE CEILING EXPLODES aining debris. Nightmare shapes drop into the room ewt screams. Hudson opens fire. Vasquez grabs Hicks ulls him up, firing one handed with her flamethrower ipley scoops up Newt and staggers back. Gorman turn o fire and Burke bolts for the only remaining exit he corridor connecting to the med lab. In th trobelike glare of the pulse-rifles we SEE flashe f aliens, moving forward in the smoke from th lamethrower fires. They move like nothing human.. eaping quick as insects at times or gliding wit owerful, balletic grace.
_RIPLEY
"Medical! Get to medical!"
She dashes for the corridor NT. MED LAB CORRIDO OLLYING BEHIND HER as she sprints, the walls becomin  frenzied blur. Ahead of her Burke clears the door t he med lab. HE SLIDES IT CLOSED. Ripley slams int he door. Tries the latch. Hears it LOCK from the fa ide.
_RIPLEY
"Burke! Open the door!"
_NEWT
"Look!"
Behind her an alien is moving down the corridor like  ocomotive, a graceful skeleton shape as lethal an nhuman as you can imagine. Strobe flashes backligh he demented silhouette. Shaking, Ripley raises he ifle. She squeezes the trigger. NOTHING HAPPENS he creature HISSES, baring its teeth as it advances ipley checks the SAFETY. The safety is off. Th IGITAL COUNTER. The magazine is full. Newt begins t ail. Ripley's hands, slick with sweat, are tremblin o much she almost drops the rifle. Panic screams i er brain. The thing is almost on her, filling th orridor, when she remembers. She snaps the bolt back hambering a round. Whips the stock to her shoulder IRES. FLASH-CRACK! A FLASHBULB GLIMPSE OF shriekin aws as the silhouette is hurled back, screechin nsanely ipley is slammed against the door by the recoil linded by the flash and deafened by the concussion NT. OPERATION icks looks up. Fires POINT-BLANK at a leapin ilhouette. SCREEEECH! The fire-control system ha ripped, with sprinklers spraying the room and  indless SIREN wailing. Total pandemonium.
_HUDSON
(hysterical)
"Let's go! Let's go!"
_HICKS
"Fuckin' A!"
Hudson screams as floor panels lift under him, and clawe rms seize him lightning fast, dragging him down nother skeletal shape leaps on him from above. H isappears into the subfloor crawlway. Hicks, Vasque nd Gorman make it to the med lab access corridor NT. CORRIDO tunned, Ripley sees through dissipating smoke th reature rising to advance again. Flinching agains last and glare she drills it POINT-BLANK with  LINDING BURST that carries the M-41A's muzzle righ p toward the ceiling. Newt covers her ears agains he CONCUSSION.
_HICKS
(o.s.)
"Hold you fire!"
The troopers seem to materialize out of the smoke.
_RIPLEY
(indicating door)
"Locked."
_HICKS
"Stand back."
Hicks snaps the torch off his belt and cuts into th ock. Inhuman shapes enter the far end of the corridor asquez hands her flamethrower to Gorman and unsling er rifle. She starts loading 30mm grenades into th auncher, like oversize 12-guage shells.
_GORMAN
"You can't use those in here!"
_VASQUEZ
"Right. Fire in the hole!"
She pumps a round up and fires. The grenade EXPLODES an he blast almost knocks them down. Hicks kicks the doo pen, molten droplets flying.
_HICKS
(shouting at Vasquez)
"Thanks a lot! Now I can't hear shit."
_VASQUEZ
(shouting)
"What?"
INT. MED LAB ANNE asquez slides the door almost closed, then fires thre renades rapid-fire through the gap. She slams the doo ome as the grenades detonate, the explosion soundin onglike through the metal ipley sprints across the room, trying the far door urke has locked it as well. Hicks switches hi and-torch from CUT to WELD and starts sealing the doo hey just passed through NT. MED LA urke, hyperventilating with terror, backs across th ark chamber. Gasping, almost paralyzed with fear, h rosses the chamber to the door leading to the mai oncourse. His fingers reach for the latch. It move y itself. The door opens slowly N BURKE his eyes wide, transfixed by his fate. W ear the BULLWHIP CRACK of a tail-stinger striking as we:
_CUT TO:
INT. MED LAB ANNE he door dimples with a clanging impact, separatin lightly from its frame. Another crash, the squeal o ortured steel. Newt grabs Ripley by the hand an ugs her across the room.
_NEWT
"Come on! This way."
She leads Ripley to an air vent set low in the wall an xpertly unlatches the grille, swinging it open. New tarts inside but Ripley pulls her back.
_RIPLEY
"Stay behind me."
Ripley trades her rifle for Gorman's flamethrower befor e can protest and enters the air shaft, which is  ight fit. Newt scrambles in behind, followed by Hicks orman and Vasquez on rearguard. Glancing bac earfully Newt pushes on Ripley's butt as they craw apidly through the shaft.
_NEWT
"Come on. Crawl faster."
_RIPLEY
"DO you know how to get to the landing field from here?"
_NEWT
"Sure. Go left."
Ripley turns into a larger MAIN DUCT where there i nough room to crab-walk in a low crouch. She runs craping her back on the ceiling. The troopers' armo latters in the confined space. They approach a ntersection. She fires the flamethrower around th orner, the looks. Clear.
_NEWT
"Go right."
They sprint into the narrow connecting duct, the maz ecoming a blur. Ripley fires the flamethrowe eriodically, as they pass side ducts covered b ouvered grilles or vertical shafts going to higher o ower levels.
_HICKS
(into headset)
"Bishop, you read me? Come in, over."
There is a long pause then Bishop's VOICE, almos nintelligible with interference, comes over the radio.
_BISHOP
(voice over;
"static) Yes, I read you. Not very well..."
EXT. UP-LINK RELAY - LANDING FIEL ishop is huddled against the base of the telemetr ast, out of the wind which is now gusting viciously.
_BISHOP
(yelling;
"over enunciating) The ship is on its way. ETA about sixteen minutes. I've got my hands full flying... the weather's come up a bit."
Bishop's fingers are blurring over the terminal keys an e squints, watching the screen as the flight telemetr pdates rapidly n the b.g. the AP station has become a raging demon reathed in boiling steam and electrical discharges NT. AIR DUCT 160
_HICKS
"All right, stand by there. We're on out way. Over."
The beam of Ripley's light wavers hypnotically in th unnel ahead. She blinks, seeing something...not sure  GLINTING OBSCENE FORM MOVING TOWARD THEM, filling th unnel at the absolute limit of the light's power.
_RIPLEY
"Back. Go back!"
They try to crawl back, jamming together. Behind them he way they have come, a GRATING is battered in with  EROCIOUS CLANG and the deadly silhouette of a warrio lows into the duct. They are trapped. Vasquez use er flamethrower, bathing the tunnel in fire. Hick naps out his hand-welder and cuts into the wall of th uct. Molten metal spatters him, as sparks fill th unnel with lurid light. Vasquez' flamethrower sputters.
_VASQUEZ
(icy)
"Losing fuel."
Between eye-searing bursts of flame Ripley sees th listening apparitions closing in. Hicks' torch feather ut. Empty. Bracing his back he kicks hard at th herry-hot metal. It bends aside eyond is a narrow SERVICE WAY, lined with pipes an onduit. Hicks slides through the searing hole ifting Newt safely through as Ripley hands her out ipley follows and turns to help Gorman. Vasquez lamethrower goes dry. She draws her SERVICE PISTOL uddenly she looks up as a WARRIOR SCREECHES DOWN FRO  VERTICAL SHAFT, right above her he fires with incredible rapidity...BAM! BAM! BAM olls aside. It lands on her legs and she snaps her hea o one side just as its TAIL STINGER buries into th etal wall beside her cheek. She fires again, emptyin he pistol, kicking the thrashing shape away cid cuts through her chickenplate armor, searing int er thigh. She cries out, gritting her teeth agains he white-hot pain. Gorman sees Vasquez hit, unable t ove. Sees the creatures coming the other way...an urns away from the escape hole. He crawls back to her rabs her battle harness and starts dragging her toward afety. Too late. The approaching alien warriors hav eached and passed the opening. Vasquez sees him arely conscious.
_VASQUEZ
(hoarse whisper)
"You always were an asshole, Gorman."
She seizes his hand in a deadly drip, but we RECOGNIZ t as the "power greeting" she shared with Drake.. omething for the chosen few. Gorman returns the grip e hands her two grenades and arms two himself as th reatures are upon them NT. SERVICE WA USHING WITH Ripley, Newt and Hicks as a full tilt run he service way lights up with a POWERFUL BLAST behin hem and they stumble with the shock wave. Newt break ut ahead and it's all Ripley and Hicks can do to kee p.
_NEWT
"This way. Come on, we're almost there!"
_RIPLEY
"Newt, wait!"
The kid moves like lightning, diving and dodging aroun bstacles. If it wasn't clear before it's clear no hat we are on her turf, and she's the ace. Running o nd on, their breathing loud and echoing...the wall  directionless blur. Newt never hesitates hey reach a junction with a narrow ANGLED CHUTE whic uns upward at a steep
degrees.
_NEWT
"Here! Go up."
INT. CHUT ipley looks up the angles shaft, seeing light at th op...an exterior vent hood. The sound of wind boom own from above. Like blowing across a bottle to astly amplified ipley enters, bracing her feet on perilously narro ide ribs in the shaft. She looks down. The chut escends far into the depths, lost in shadow. Sh tarts to climb with Next behind/below her, and Hicks ust emerging from the side duct.
_NEWT
"Just up there --"
Newt slips, a rusted rib collapsing under her foot. Sh lides...catches herself with one hand. Ripley reache or her, dropping her light. The hand-light goe kittering and bumping down the chute, around a bend nd disappears ipley strains, reaching, her hand groping for Newt's hey miss, inches apart.
_NEWT
"Riiiiipppleee --"
She slips. Hicks lunges, grabbing her oversized jacket ND SHE SLIPS OUT OF IT. With an echoing scream New lummets, sliding down the chute into darkness OVING WITH HER, the walls racing by in a dizzy blur lik  bobsled ride. THe shaft pitches left. Newt bounces liding halfway up the wall. The chute forks ahead ewt tumbles into the right shaft, which drops at  teeper angle into the depths. Just disappearing dow he LEFT SHAFT we SEE Ripley's light ipley looks Hicks in the eye. And kicks free...slidin own the chute after Newt. Ripley slams her feet int he side-ribs, bracing herself in a controlled descent ipley reaches the "V." Sees the glow of the light i he left fork. She goes left.
_RIPLEY
"Newt!"
She hears a plaintive reply, so echoey and distorted i as no direction.
_NEWT
(o.s.)
"Mommy...where are you?"
Ripley reaches the bottom of the chute where i ntersects with a HORIZONTAL SERVICE TUNNEL. The ligh s lying there, but no Newt. The echoing wail come gain.
_NEWT
(o.s.)
"Moooommeeee..."
Ripley starts down the tunnel, answering. Newt's cal omes again. Fainter? She can't tell. She spins i  growing panic, starts the other way.
_RIPLEY
(to her headset)
"Hicks, get down here. I need that locator."
INT. SUBBASEMEN ewt is in a low grottolike chamber, filled with pipe nd machines. It is flooded, almost up to Newt's waist he looks up, seeing light streaming through a grating ipley's voice seems to come from there.
_RIPLEY
(o.s.)
"Newt! Star wherever you are!"
Newt climbs some pipes, straining to reach the grating NT. SERVICE TUNNE icks joins Ripley, unsnapping the emergency-locato rom his belt. They follow the signal into a lighte rea where the power apparently was not cut.
_HICKS
"This way. We're close..."
Following the signal they come to a grating set in th loor.
_NEWT
"Here! I'm here. I'm here."
Ripley runs to the grating. Looking down she sees Newt' earstreaked face. Newt reaches up. Her tiny finger riggle up through the bars of the grate. Riple queezes the child's precious fingertips.
_RIPLEY
"Climb down, honey. We have to cut through this grate."
Newt backs away, climbing down the pipe as Hicks cut nto the bars with his hand-torch NT. SUBBASEMEN ewt, standing waist deep in the water, watches spark hower blindingly as Hicks cuts. She bites her lip rembling. Cold and terrified. Silently a glistenin hape rises in one graceful motion from the water behin er. It stands, dripping, dwarfing her tiny form. New urns, sensing the movement...She SCREAMS as th hadow engulfs her NT. SERVICE TUNNE ipley panics, hearing screaming below, then splashing he and Hicks kick desperately at the grating, smashin t down. Heedless of the cherry-hot edges Riple unges into the hole with her light.
_RIPLEY
"Newt! Newt!"
The surface of the water reflects the beam placidly ewt is gone. Bobbing in the water, eyes staring, is
"Casey" the doll head. In sinks slowly, distorting,
vanishing in darkness icks pulls Ripley away from the hole. She struggle uriously, trying to tear out of his grip.
_RIPLEY
"No! Noooo!"
He drags her back. It takes all of his strength.
_HICKS
(intense)
"She's gone! Let's go!"
He sees something moving toward them through a lattic f pipes. Ripley is irrational. Hysterical.
_RIPLEY
"No! No! She's alive! We have to --"
_HICKS
"All right! She's alive. I believe it. But we gotta get moving! Now!"
He drags her toward an ELEVATOR not far away at th nd of the tunnel. Gets her inside, slamming her agains he back wall. Hits the button to go to surface level n alien warrior leaps into the tunnel, start oward them. The doors are closing. Not fast enough he creature gets one arm through, the doors closing o t. THEY OPEN AGAIN, an automatic safety feature. TH ARRIOR HISSES, LUNGING. Hicks FIRES, POINT-BLANK. I pins away, SCREECHING. Acid sluices between the closin oors, across Hicks' armored chest plate, as he shield ipley with his body. The lift starts upward. Hicks ingers race with the clasps as the stuff eats its wa oward his skin. Galvanized out of her hysteria, Riple laws at his armor, helping him as much as she can. H creams as the acid contacts his chest and arm. H hucks out of the combat armor like a madman, droppin he smoking pieces to the floor. Acrid fumes fill th ir, searing eyes and lungs. The elevator stops. Th oors part and they stumble out, Ripley supporting Hick ho is doubled over in agony.
_RIPLEY
"Come on, you can make it. Almost there."
EXT. LANDING FIEL rop-ship two descends toward the landing grid ide-slipping in hurricane gusts. Bishop stands, guidin t with the portable terminal. The ship sets down hard lides sideways. Stops. Bishop turns as Ripley an icks stumble out of a doorway in the colony buildin ehind him. He goes to them, helping to support Hick nd they run toward the ship, buffeted by the gale ipley shouts, her words barely audible over the wind.
_RIPLEY
"HOW MUCH TIME?"
_BISHOP
"PLENTY! TWENTY-SIX MINUTES!"
_RIPLEY
"WE'RE NOT LEAVING!"
The loading ramp deploys and they run into the ship XT. PROCESSING STATIO n infernal engine, roaring out of control. Steam blast nd swirls, lightning zaps around the superstructure an olumns of incandescent gas thunder hundreds of feet int he air e APPROACH, hypnotically. The drop-ship ENTERS FRAME oving toward the station. It pivots, hovering in th lasting turbulence, and settles onto a NARROW LANDIN LATFORM ten levels above the ground, or about a thir f the way up the enormous structure NT. DROP-SHI ipley finishes winding tape around a bulky object an rops the roll. She has crudely fastened a M-41 ssault rifle together, side by side, with a flamethrower  massive, unwieldy package of absolute firepower. He ovements are curt, precise...determined. She work apidly, snatching magazines, grenades, belts and othe ear from the fully stocked ordnance racks of th rop-ship ishop comes aft from the pilot's compartment to hel icks dress his injuries. Hicks is sprawled in a fligh eat, the contents of a FIELD MEDICAL KEY strewn aroun im. He's out of the game...contorted with pain.
_BISHOP
"Ripley..."
_RIPLEY
"She's alive. They brought her here and you know it."
_BISHOP
"In seventeen minutes this place will be a cloud of vapor the size of Nebraska."
Ripley is stuffing gear rapidly into a satchel, her hand lying.
_RIPLEY
"Hicks, don't let him leave."
_HICKS
(grimacing with
"pain) We ain't going anywhere."
She hefts the hybrid weapon, grabs the satchel and spin o the door controls. The door opens. Wind an achine-thunder blast in.
_RIPLEY
"See you, Hicks."
Hicks is holding a wad of gauze plastered over his face.
_HICKS
"Dwayne. It's Dwayne."

Ripley runs down the ramp, crossing the platform to th pen doors of a LARGE FREIGHT ELEVATOR. The doors close NT. FREIGHT ELEVATOR 17 he elevator descends. Bars of light move rhythmicall cross her as Ripley stands facing the doors, watchin he landings go by. The heat grows more intense. Pipe lowing cherry-red pass by. Steam hisses and billows he lift clatters in a steady beat. Hypnotic ipley removes her jacket and dons a battle harnes irectly over her T-shirt. Her hair is matted, an he glistens with sweat. Her eyes burn with  etermination that holds the gut-panic in check he elevator descends. She checks her weapon. Attache  BANDOLIER OF GRENADES to her harness. Primes th lamethrower. Checks the rifle's magazine. Racks th olt, chambering the first round. She checks th ARKING FLARES jammed in the thigh pockets of he ump pants. She drops an unprimed grenade, trembling orcing herself to be strong. We SEE she doesn' now doodley about grenades his is the most terrifying thing she has ever done. Sh egins to hyperventilate, soaking with sweat. Her finger lick and slippery on the rifle. The elevator descends he lift motors whine, slowing. It hits bottom with  ump. The safety cage retracts. Slowly, expectantly he doors open ER P.O.V. THROUGH the parting doors...an empt orridor. Dark, swirling with steam, a ruddy glo ISIBLE here and there. It seems to have been a descen nto Dantean Hell. The air itself vibrates with hea istortion. Couplings groan. Machinery whines an hrobs. Like the beating of a vast heart the poundin f massive pumps echoes through the station NT. CORRIDO ipley moves out of the lift, knuckles white on th ifle. Her eyes dart, straining to penetrate the letha loom. Behind her we SEE a SECOND ELEVATOR next t ers, its lift cage somewhere on a higher floor. Ahea he corridor is encrusted with the alien excressenc nd not far down the bio-mechanoid catacomb begins he enters the maze, darting glances at Hick's LOCATOR aped to the top of her kludge weapon  VOICE echoes down the tunnels, calm and mechanical.

She approaches a ntersecting tunnel. Flashing emergency light lluminate the insane fresco of the walls. She spins iring the flamethrower. Nothing there. She whirl ack. Moves forward, trembling and adrenalized keletal figures drown in the walls, frozen in macabr ormented positions like human insects in amber team blasts, blinding her. The locator signa trengthens an she turns, crouches through a lo assage, turns again. At each intersection she quickl ights a FIFTEEN-MINUTE MARKING FLARE and drops it or the way back. She has to turn sideways, inchin hrough a fissure between two walls of death...cocoo iches, human bas-relief sealed in resin UDDENLY SOMETHING SHOOTS OUT, GRABBING HER!

"Ripley...help me. I can feel it...inside. Oh, God...it's moving! Oh gooood..."
She looks at him. No one deserves this.
_RIPLEY
"Here."
She hands him a grenade, wrapping his fingers aroun he spoon, and pulls the primer. She moves on.
_VOICE
"You now have eleven minutes to reach minimum safe distance."
Ripley moves ahead. The locator signals shows she i lmost there. A CONCUSSION rocks the place, like a arthquake, jarring her almost off her feet. The nother. The whole station seems to shudder. A SIRE egins to wail a demented rhythm. Following the tracke he turns a corner and stops. The RANGE INDICATOR READ ERO. She looks down, horrified to see Newt's trace racelet lying on the floor of the tunnel. All hop ecedes, disintegrating into mindless chaos NT. EGG CHAMBE ewt is cocooned in a pillarlike structure at th dge of a cluster of upright OVOID SHAPES...alie ggs. Her eyelids flutter open and she become ware of her surroundings. The egg nearest he egins to move...opening like an obscene flower a ts top to reveal something stirring within.

EGG CHAMBE ewt watches the face-hugger emerge and turn towar er. Ripley runs in just as it is tensing to leap nd FIRES, blasting it with a burst from the assaul ifle. The flash illuminates the figure of a dult warrior, nearby. It spins, moving straigh or Ripley. Firing from the hip she drills it wit wo controlled bursts which catapult it back. Sh teps toward it, FIRING AGAIN. Her expression i urderous. AND AGAIN. It spins onto its back he unleashes the flamethrower and it vanishes i  fireball. Ripley runs to Newt and begins tearin t the fresh resinous cocoon material, freeing th hild. She swings her up onto her back.
_NEWT
(weakly)
"I knew you'd come."
_RIPLEY
"Newt, I want you to hang on, now. Hang on tight."
Groggily Newt hooks her arms and legs through the belt f Ripley's battle harness as Ripley picks up he eapon. More warriors are moving toward her amon he eggs. She fires the flamethrower. The eggs ar ngulfed. One of the warriors lunges forward,  iving fireball. She blasts it in half with tw ursts from the M-41A. Ripley retreats, ducking unde  glistening cylindrical mass. A PIERCING SHRIE ill the chamber. She turns. And there it is  massive silhouette in the mist, the ALIEN QUEE lowers over her eggs like a great, glistening blac nsect-Buddha. What's bigger and meaner than th lien? His momma. Her fanged head is an unimaginabl orror. Her six limbs, the four arms and tw owerful legs, are folded grotesquely over he istended abdomen. The egg-filled abdomen swell nd swells into a great pulsing tubular sac, suspende rom a lattice of pipes and conduits by a weblik embrane as if some vast coil of intestine were drape arelessly among the machinery. Ripley realize he ducked under part of it a moment before. Insid he abdominal sac can be SEEN the forms of countles ggs, churning their way toward the pulsating oviposito here they emerge glistening, to be picked up b RONES. The drones are tiny scuttling albino version f the "warrior" aliens we have already seen ipley pumps the slide on her grenade launcher. Sh ires. Pumps and fires again. Four times.

The Queen goe erserk, SCREECHING like some psychotic steam whistle ipley lays about her with the flamethrower, ignitin verything in sight with an insane fury. Eggs shrive n the inferno, and figures of warriors and drone anish in frenzied thrashing. Over all is the Queen' hrieking as she struggles in the flames. Tw arriors emerge from the boiling smoke, closing o er. She pulls the trigger...an empty click. DIGITA OUNTER flashing crimson zeroes. She drops th agazine, grabs another from her belt, rams it hom nd OPENS UP he creatures vanish in rapid-fire flashes.

Then sh ashes into the catacombs, navigating by sheer prima nstinct NT. CATACOMB ipley runs, blindly, with panting intensity vergin n hysteria.

Ripley uses the flamethrower ahead of her, firin ursts of pulse-rifle fire down side corridors a ndistinct shapes and shadows. The weapon is empt hen she reaches the freight elevators. A mass o ebris, falling down the shaft from a higher level as demolished the life cage she descended in. Sh lams the control for the other cage and hears th ound of the LIFT MOTOR'S WHINE as it begins it low descent from several levels up. AN ENRAGE CREECH ECHOES in the corridor. Ripley sees  ilhouette moving in the smoke...a glistening blac hape which FILLS THE CORRIDOR TO THE CEILING...TH UEEN. Her last cartridge is reading zeroes. Th lamethrower sputters uselessly when she tries that he grenades are gone. Ripley drops the weapon an ooks up the shaft to the descending lift...then a he approaching FIGURE. The elevator won't be in time he runs to a ladder set in the wall as a horrendou creech beats in her ears. She scrambles up th ungs NT. SECOND LEVEL 18 ipley struggles up through a narrow hatch, New linging to her. She dives aside as a POWERFU LACK ARM shoots up through the opening, it azor claws slamming into the grille-floor inche rom her.

As she rises she hears the LIF OTORS start up. Looking down through the lattic ork of the station she sees the life cage star minously upward. She knows there is only on xplanation for that. She runs on, the stairwel ecoming a crazy whirl around her XT.

Her shouts become inarticulate screams of hatred utrage at the final betrayal. She scans the sky othing.

"BISHOP!"
Newt is sobbing he lift rises ponderously INTO VIEW. Ripley turns acking away from the doors toward the railing. Ther s no place to run to on the platform. EXPLOSION etonate in the complex far below and huge fireball well upward through the machinery. The platform buck ildly. Nearby a cooling tower collapses with  HUNDEROUS ROAR and the SHRIEK OF RENDING STEEL. Mor XPLOSIONS, one after another, rocketing up from below ipley stares transfixed as the lift stops.

"You now have thirty seconds to reach..."
Ripley leaps for the loading boom projecting down fro he cargo bay and it raises them into the ship.  REMENDOUS EXPLOSION RIPS THROUGH THE COMPLEX nearby lamming the ship sideways. Its extended landing leg oul in a tangle of conduit, grinding with a hideou queal of metal on metal NT./EXT. DROP-SHIP - STATION 186-

Ripley leaps into a seat with Newt, cradling her. Begin trapping in. Bishop wrestles with the controls. Th anding legs retract, ripping free. Ripley slams he eat harness latches home.
_RIPLEY
"Punch it, Bishop!"
The entire lower level of the station disappears in  ireball. The air vibrates with intense heat waves an oncussion. The drop-ship engines fire. Ripley i lammed back in her seat. The ship vaults out and up ishop standing it on its tail, pouring on the gees ipley and Newt see everything shake into a blur XT.

_BISHOP
"I gave him a shot, for the pain. We'll need to get a stretcher to cart him up to medical."
Ripley nods and, picking up Newt, precedes Bishop dow he aisle to the loading ramp.
_BISHOP
"I'm sorry if I gave you a scare but that platform was just becoming too unstable..."
INT. CARGO LOCK - DROP-SHI ishop continues as they move down the ramp.
_BISHOP
"I had to circle and hope things didn't get too rough to take you off."
Ripley turns to him, stopping partway down the ramp he puts her hand on his shoulder.
_RIPLEY
"You did okay, Bishop."
_BISHOP
"Well, thanks, I --"
He notices a tiny innocuous drop of liquid splash onto th amp next to his shoe. SSSSSS. Acid. SOMETHING BURST ROM HIS CHEST, spraying Ripley with milklike android blood t is the razor-sharp scorpion TAIL of the alien QUEEN riven right through him from behind. Bishop thrashes eizing the protruding section of tail in his hands, as i lowly lifts him off the deck. Above them the Quee lowers from its place of concealment among the hydrauli echanisms inside one landing-leg bay. It blends perfectl ith the machinery until it begins to emerge. Seizin ishop in two great hands it rips him apart and flings hi side, shredded, like a doll. It descends slowly to th eck, the rotating lights glistening across its shiny blac imbs, dripping acid and rage. Still smoking where Riple alf-fried it.

It descends slowly, its six limbs unfolding i nhuman geometries ipley moves with nightmarish slowness herself, starin ypnotized...terrified to break and run. She lowers New o the deck, never taking her eyes off the creature.

"Get away from her, you bitch!"
The Queen SCREECHES pure lethality and leaps ALLOP! A roundhouse from one great hydraulic arm catche t on its hideous skull and slams it into a wall. I ebounds into a massive backhand. CRASH! It goe ackward into heavy loading equipment.

"Come on!"
The Queen emerges as a blur of rage, lashing wit nbelievable fury. The battle is joined laws swipe, tail lashes. Ripley parries with radica wipes of the steel forks. They circle in a whirlin lur, demolishing everything in their path. The cavernou hamber echoes with nightmarish sounds...WHINE, CRASH LANG, SCREECH hey lock in a death embrace. Ripley closes the forks rushing two of the creature's limbs. It lashes an rithes with incredible fury, coming within inches of he xposed body. She lifts it off the ground. The hin egs rip at her, slamming against the safety cage, dentin t in. The striking teeth extend almost a meter fro nside its fanged maw, shooting between the crash-bars he ducks and the teeth slam into the seat cushio ehind her dead in a spray of drool. Yellow acid foam own the hydraulic arms toward her. The creature rip t high-pressure hoses. Purple hydraulic fluid spray ..machine blood mixing with alien blood. They topple ff balance.

The inner doors close he turbulent air eddies and settles he lies on her back, drained of all strength. Gaspin or breath. Weakly she turns her head, seeing Bisho till holding Newt by the arm.
