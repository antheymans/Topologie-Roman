WASH OUT TO:
HOT SUN overhead in a BIG SKY  XT BADLANDS - AFTERNOO odged in the cracked earth are the partially-exposed fossilized remain f A VELOCIRAPTER, a carnivorous dinosaur. WIDEN OUT to a SWEEP  ANORAMA of a dinosaur dig, a major excavation filled with worker hoveling earth and stone, making measurements, taking photographs cribbling notes, and conferring with each other he center of all this activity is one man. In a roped-off area tha ircumscribes the exposed bones of the raptor, is DR. ALAN GRANT, hea aleontologist. Good-looking, late 30's, with a think beard rant lies on his belly, completely absorbed in a small piece of bone  GROUP OF TWELVE STUDENTS, notebooks in hand, await his next sentence LOSE ON - the tiny bone. Grant's nose touches it rant brushes the bone with a toothbrush. Then he decides on a quicke ay to clean it. He licks it. Excited by his discovery, he gets to hi eet and addresses his students, who listen raptly.
_GRANT
"Right calcaneus of an adult female raptor. Mild stress fractures. What's this tell me?"
Students look at each other. A tentative hand. Grant continues.
 
"GRANT It tells me that this bone connects to the navicula which we already found articulating to the cuboid."
OFFSCREEN, a woman SHOUTS to him.
_ELLIE (off)
"Dr. Grant! Dr. Grant!"
Grant looks up R. ELLIE SATTLER, late 20's, sharp-eyed, tough if she wants to be, run ike a gazelle across the arid land. Exuberant, she leaves a trail o ust behind her he zips by A STUDENT guarding the cordoned area. He tries to stop her.
_STUDENT
"Dr. Sattler! Dr. Grant is thinking!"
Dr. Grant waves her over enthusiastically with his bone and continues.
_GRANT
"So, what can we stay for sure? Stress fractures in the heel ..."
Uncertain students. Ellie arrives and immediately gets into it.
_ELLIE
"She jumps."
Grant turns around to her and smiles. She's got it. Other students t  they knew is all along.
 
_GRANT
"Right as rain, Ellie. Now, why did she jump?"
No answer. Ellie gives it a try.
_ELLIE
"A defensive posture against a vicious, blood-thirsty T-Rex?"
_GRANT
(nodding)
"Perhaps. Or maybe to select the smaller, more tender leaves in the higher branches with which to suckle her young?"
Ellie jumps up.
_ELLIE
"I bet is was a mating ritual."
Students laugh. One student eyes Grant's self-conscious smile at Ellie.
_GRANT
"The science of paleontology can't answer these questions. Novelists and artists who dream a vision of the Jurassic period can attempt these questions with their imaginations. What we scientists can say is considering the mass and kinetic articulation of these bones, this animal had a vertical leap"
of about twelve feet.
"Not as entertaining as fiction, but absolutely fact without prejudice."
Ellie intrudes again.
_ELLIE
"Excuse me, Dr. Grant. But ... fact is, we're late. There's the car."
She points. On the horizon, a limousine speeds toward them, leaving  usty wake rant sets the rules for his departure, giving instructions individuall s Ellie pulls him away, carrying their bags.
_GRANT
"Jim, you keep making up the plaster batches. Whatever ratio you're using, it's perfect. Nora, no digging after five - when the temperature drops, those bones are just too brittle. Bill, I don't want any tourists walking over my raptor - I don't care if the Governor of Montana is with them, just you guys."
Grant and Ellie continue walking. She interrupts his continued barrage.
_ELLIE
"You know, if ev"
ery scientist stuck to his
"method like you, there would be no body of theory - no quasars, no big bang -"
Grant stops at the sight of the stopped limo and freezes.
_GRANT
"Jesus, a limousine. We're re-entering Hammond's world, that's for sure. (beat) Remind me why we're doing this, Ellie."
Ellie is gentle. She's telling him something they've discussed before.
_ELLIE
"We're leaving the raptor dig -"
_GRANT
"- at a critical time -"
_ELLIE
"- because Gennaro is paying us sixty thousand dollars to observe some resort of Hammond's in Costa Rica. And that's -"
_GRANT
"- enough money to keep us free of commercial affiliations for two summers. All right, all right. Good."
Then, half-kidding with Ellie:
_GRANT
"Financial"
independence for fraternizing
"with the enemy? (beat) I'll do it."
She laughs. But he can't quite leave. He grabs a computer printout
_GRANT
"This is all could come up with, Skip?"
Skip turns the printout right-side up in Grant's hand. Grant smiles.
_GRANT
"Wise guy. Let's go, Ellie."
Grant and Ellie board the limo amidst many goodbyes from the students he limo pulls away XT HIGH TECH BUILDING - BIOGENETIC CORPORATION HQ - SUNSE  purple sunset irradiates the exterior glass walls of the building NT BIOGEN H  peanut flies in the air. Then falls into a big open mouth. THOMP.
_MOUTH
"Five hundred thousand is peanuts!"
He tosses another peanut and misses his open mouth. This is DENNI EDRY, a 40 year old computer programmer. He's fat, with greasy hai nd a permanently wrinkled suit. His slovenly looks are wildly out o lace on the rich leather sofa where he recli s cross a gleaming granite coffee table is BILL BAKER, businessman.  mooth meticulous dresser, Baker is disgusted by Nedry's slopp ppearance and voracious consumption of food and drink edry finishes a coke. Over his shoulder is an impressive skyline view.
_NEDRY
"I'm not reneging. I'm re-evaluating."
Nedry holds the can of coke upside-down, drains the last drops.
_NEDRY
"You think I'm a scumbag, I know."
Nedry chuckles, lines up three peanuts on the table. One after th ther, he throws them in the air. He gulps down two, misses one. I kids across the glossy floor aker's head involuntarily cocks as he looks disgustedly at Nedry.
_NEDRY
"Look pal, you make a career in biogenetic industrial espionage, and you're bound to run across a scumbag or two. Guaranteed! Part of the job description. Look, who's to say, who is the real scumbag? After all, I know what you guys need so bad. I've heard of reverse engineering."
As Nedry continues he shovels nuts into his mouth and CHOMPS and SPEAKS.
_NEDRY
"Let the other guy put in all the work, all the R and D. You take the finished product, work backwards, breaking it down to reveal its genetic code. Presto! In a few measly months you have know-how that took researchers ten years to determine. You know how much Hammond has invested of his own personal wealth? Over five billion dollars! And if you guys get the jump on his - in no time, the market's wide-open."
Nedry starts the LAUGH as he EATS and TALKS.
_NEDRY
"But, boy, he's really got his product! Oh yes siree, massive, gargantuan, money- making, never-heard-of-profit-like-that product. It is a sight! Yes, indeedy!"
Nedry LAUG  explosively. He begins to choke, COUGHING and GASPING aker is repulsed. He stares out the window as the sun sets edry, in true distress, clutches his own throat. He clumsily run oward Baker, toppling chairs as he goes. Nedry grabs Baker's hand an queezes it tightly, imploring Baker for help. Baker coolly shakes hi and loose and shoves Nedry to the floor. Baker looks down at the pron nd desperate Nedry.
_BAKER
"Scumbag. We have a deal. That deal is not open to renegotiation. Or even re- evaluation."
Bakers kneels down next to Nedry, who is beginning to turn blue.
_BAKER
"The deal stands. Take it or leave it."
Baker glances at his watch.
_BAKER
"I'll give you a few minutes to decide."
Nedry makes a superhuman effort just to nod his head. Baker nods bac nd SLAMS his fist into Nedry's solar plexus. It works edry sucks in a huge gulp of air. He sits u  rubbing his belly. A aker leaves the room:
_BAKER
"Make sure the eggs are on that supply ship. Just make sure!"
CAMERA LEAVES NEDRY and exits the window. IT SWISHPANS the concret anyons of Wall Street and enters another office NT CONSERVATIVE LAW OFFICE - DA ONALD GENNARO, handsome, meticulously dressed, paces the highl olished, glassy corner suite. His boss, ROSS, is seated. He's  owerful black man who waves a prosthetic arm.
_ROSS
"We can't trust Hammond anymore. He's under too much pressure. There's the EPA, he's behind schedule, and the in- vestors are getting nervous. There have been too many rumors, too many accidents. We can't screw around with this."
_GENNARO
"I've asked Hammond to arrange independent site inspections every week for the next three weeks."
_ROS
S
"What does he say?"
_GENNARO
"Insists nothing's wrong on the island."
_ROSS
"You know him. Do you believe him?"
_GENNARO
"No, I don't. I spent a lot of time with him five years ago when we raised the capital. And it was a wild ride. He's unpredictable, a dreamer."
_ROSS
"Potentially dangerous. We should never have gotten involved. What's our position?"
_GENNARO
"The firm owns five percent."
_ROSS
"General or limited?"
_GENNARO
"General."
_ROSS
"We should have never done that."
_GENNARO
"It seemed wise at the time. We all wanted the park to happen. It was in lieu of fees."
_ROSS

In any case, I agree an inspection is
"overdue. Who are your site experts?"
Gennaro tosses a list on Ross' desk. He check it out.
_ROSS
"Will they tell the truth?"
_GENNARO
"I think so. That guy Grant's a hotshot in his field, always goes his own way -"
_ROSS
"- Good. You're making all the arrangements?"
_GENNARO
"Hammond asked to place the calls himself. I think he wants to pretend the park is not in trouble. That it's just a social invitation, showing off the island."
_ROSS
"All right ... Good. But let's be very clear about one thing. I don't know how bad this situation actually is, Donald. But if there's a problem on that island - don't be afraid to screw Hammond and burn Jurassic Park to the ground."
Gennaro shakes hands wkwardly with Ross and leaves. Ross paces. Fed p, he whispers to himself.
_ROSS
"Costa Rica, my ass."
He whacks his desk globe, sends its spinning AMERA MOVES IN on spinning globe as we HEAR the ROTOR BLADES of  elicopter and DISSOLVE TO NT/EXT HELICOPTER IN SKY - DAW n the helicopter tail is a little blue logo that reads: Isla Nublar NSIDE, Grant, Ellie and Gennaro are in the right back row. Elli ozes, her head occasionally dropping onto Grant's shoulder, to hi iscomfort. Gennaro looks at papers, trying not to look through th lear plexi-bubble at their feet. Next to THE PILOT, Nedry chews  andy bar. He offers candy to the back row rant loses himself, looking out the window RANT'S POV - the aquamarine blue of the ocean. Below the waters ther re the shadows of ample marine life. Dolphins leap in the air uddenly the clear scene becomes obscured by clouds here is turbulence. Ellie wakes, glances at Grant, then out th indow. here is mist and she absently traces her finger in it, shapin  dinosaur figure. Now land comes into view and for a moment, th sland below them eerily fits right into her doodling.
_PILOT
"That's Isla Nublar. Buckle up, the descent is a little hairy."
Gennaro cinches his belt tightly and half-shuts his eyes. Nedry take ut a sandwich and cockily loosens his belt. Ellie looks every way.
_ELLIE
"This is exciting!"
_GRANT
"What is, Ellie? Where are we going?"
Grant looks out his window. The helicopter rushes forward, low to th ater. Ahead, Grant sees the island, rugged and craggy, rising sharply
_GRANT
"Looks like Alcatraz."
The pilot coughs and rubs his goggles with the back of his hand.
_PILOT
"There's bad wind shear on this peak."
Grant nods. Gennaro sweats, watching the pilot tighten his own belt lli miles excitedly as the helicopter starts down. Now, A BLANKE OG. Grant can't see a thing out his window. Ellie's startled.
_ELLIE
"How the hell is he landing this thing?"
No answer. Grant dimly discerns green branches of pine trees throug he mist. Some are very close. Ellie's hands grasps her seat cushion.
_ELLIE
"This is not fun."
Grant looks through the plexi-bubble at his feet. He sees the gian lowing fluorescent cross below. Lights FLASH at corners of the cross.
_GRANT
"Relax, Ellie. I'm sure they wouldn't land if it weren't safe."
The copter suddenly SHAKES violently. Ellie grabs Grant's hand ennaro sits straight up, eyes squeezed shut.
_GRANT
"Gennaro? This guy knows what he's doing, Right? Hey, Gennaro? I'm talking to you!"
Another violent shake. Grant squeezes Ellie's hand back LOSEUP - Nedry's hand crushes a acket of crackers ennaro is soaked. He opens one eye and looks about, very frightened e speaks a mantra.
_GENNARO
"No problem. Relax, relax."
The pilot whispers to himself and corrects slightly. The copter sail harply the other way.
_GRANT AND ELLIE
"Whoa!!!!"
CLOSE ON - the pilot jerks back the stick HE COPTER zooms upward. Grant's beverage flips to the ground, pour cross the floor edry's lunch does flying. Sandwich, candy, and cracker crumbs han uspended in the air. Now it all FREE-FALLS onto Nedry's lap rant and Ellie lean tightly into each other,
_ELLIE
"I don't like this feeling ..."
The pilot swings his gaze, left then right, looking at the pine forest rees are close, then far, then close. The helicopter drops rapidly llie and Grant shut their eyes. They brace themselves for the worst N AND OUT OF THE MIST, the copter descends. Tail raised high, nos ow, f  a moment it looks like a strange bug-eyes prehistoric anima ucking in its pen. In a flash, it corrects itself. The copter touche own on a heli-pad. The SOUND of the rotors fades and dies or a second, no one moves. Grant lets out a great sigh of relief ennaro mouths a silent prayer. The pilot stretches his fingers rant and Ellie self-consciously shake their hands free of each other edry unbuckles and laughs as he brushes off his lap. He turns:
_NEDRY
"Just think, Gennaro -"
(laughs harder)
"- you gotta agree it's funny! These two, they dig up dinosaurs! It's wonderful, isn't it?"
Nedry pats Grant on his shoulder.
_NEDRY
"Dr. Bones, you're going to love this place."
Nedry bursts out laughing again as he heads out the helicopter door  smile comes across Gennaro's face. As he smiles he motions with hi ands he doesn't mean any harm. Grant and Ellie stare at him.

_PILOT
"Come on folks. Gotta get back, there's a storm alert."
ROTORS TURN. OUTSIDE, a man reaches the copter. He wears a basebal ap over short red hair and he's dressed in phony safari garb. H hakes Gennaro's hand. This is ED REGIS, 35, head of Public Relations e throws open the copter door next to Grant. Big, cheerful smile.
_REGIS
"Hi! Ed Regis. Real big welcome to Isla Nublar, Dr. Grant, Dr. Sattler. Little tough landing here, I know. But you did it! Come on down, we're so happy to have you. Now, watch your step."
Ellie and Grant jump into the world of Jurassic Park XT LUSH TROPICAL FOREST - MORNIN rant takes in the beautiful tropical terrain. This place is th pposite of the Badlands. There is elaborate planting everywhere uge, hairy ferns; exotic, spiked flowers; berries of every color ushing vines. Peeking through the thick greenery are beautiful bird d flying squirrels. The strange, prehistoric world impresses Gran nd Ellie. Even Nedry and Gennaro take in the vegetal wonder hen, the SOUND of men working, grunting from exertion. Ahead, Muldoo irects A GROUP OF WORKMEN. Flame-throwers roar and machetes fight bac he abundant foliage. As they attack a new area, Regis waves Muldoo ver. Muldoon has a pronounced limp as he walks over to join them.
_ED REGIS
"This is Robert Muldoon, great African big game hunter. And he's working for us now. Doing a bang-up job, too."
Muldoon rests his rifle by a tree stump and shakes with Grant and Ellie.
_MULDOON
"Ed's a little more BS than PR. Mr. Gennaro, nice to have you back."
Gennaro nods warmly as Muldoon limps back to work egis leads on, taking Gennaro's arm and talking to him like and ol riend. Nedry lumbers in the middle, alone. At the rear, Grant an llie study everything they see. Gran alls to Regis but is ignored.
_GRANT
"Mr. Regis, what is the nature of this park?"
Ellie looks behind and sees cramped ferns spring out to capture the pat hey just walked on. She nudges Grant, who has seen the same.
_ELLIE
"Aggressive growth, huh?"
_GRANT
"Hammond's trademark."
A distinct HOOTING in the distance. Then a loud TRUMPETING. Grant an llie stop. Nedry doesn't look up. Regis flashes his salesman's smile.
_REGIS
"Out animals are greeting you!"
They pass a crude sign nailed to a tree: Welcome to Jurassic Park rant cringes at the sign. Ellie nudges him to loosen up.
_GRANT
"I hope this isn't one of those animatronic exhibits in a Jurassic botanical setting."
_NEDRY
"Nope."
Gennaro wipes his brow. They enter a green tunnel of over-arching pal hat leads to the ISITOR'S CENTER, a modern complex in the distance llie notices a large fence hidden in the brush. She nudges Grant HEIR POV - CAMERA SLOWLY CLIMBS a fifteen foot high chain-link fence he needle-spiked top of this fence cuts deep into the brush his fence is only the prelude prawling massively above and behind it is a thirty foot high fence oven throughout the fence's mesh is an intricate system of electrica ire.

The quickens his steps to catch the others hey reach a clearing with an unfinished brick sidewalk and potted shad rees waiting for planting. A crosshatching of tiny lizards scamper of he walk. An empty swimming pool is being filled by A MAN with a pumpe ruck. Next to him, WORKERS water the large ferns.
 
REGIS
"I hope you brought your bathing suits! Doesn't this mist and these plants really create a bonafide prehistoric feeling?"
Regis points to a low building with glass pyramids on the roof.
_REGIS
"There's the Visitor's Center."
A CRANE lowers an iron grating on top of one pyramid. An animal TRUMPETS NT VISITOR'S CENTER - DA LOSE ON - the iron security grating as it fits over a glass skylight bove, MASKED WORKERS weld it on. Sparks fly rant stares up at it, thinking. Footsteps echo behind him as Regis llie, Gennaro, and Nedry look around the unfinished building he Visitor's Center is two stories high, a lot of glass with expose irders and supports. It's incomplete: vines swing in the breeze wher he back wall will go and undressed cables litter the floor. Even so xhibit areas are in varying stages of completion. Behind, SEVERA PANISH WORKERS unpack masonry supplies.
_GRANT

Where's Hammond?
_REGIS
"Mr. Hammond is dying to see you guys."
Grant strides over to an exhibit as Gennaro paces impatiently.
_GENNARO
"Hot, hot, hot. Ten billion bucks and the air conditioning sucks."
Regis smiles apologetically and pushes open a large window on one of th inished walls. Giant leaves and vines burst inside rant studies an exhibit in progress entitled When Dinosaurs Rules th orld. This is a large clock that presents millions of years as hour n a single day. Many brightly colored hours are allocated to th inosaurs. Man receives the last second of the day. Ellie joins Grant.
_ELLIE
"The audicity of man to get here at the last second and think he runs the show."
Grant smiles at her inexhaustible enthusiasm. He looks at a painte ural of a Raptor on one of the walls in the half-completed gift shop edry is at a coke machine, feeding in chang  It doesn't work. H LAMS his hand against it, and finally, a cup drops down the chute pside-down. It pours. Coke splashes Nedry. He curses and exits HE ROTUNDA - Ellie pulls Grant over to a raised, round display with  atwalk. In this unfinished display, a skeletal T-Rex and a Raptor ar ocked in combat.

_VOICE (ON P.A.)
"Please come to the theater. In a moment, our film will begin."
The voice goes on to give this information in a number of languages egis waves everyone into the theater. Nedry doesn't join them. H limbs the stairs to the second floor NT SCREENING ROOM - DA mall and plush. Regis sits in the front, full of enthusiasm. Grant an llie sit further behind. ennaro stands in the back and smokes ELESTIAL MUSIC fills the room. Mist covers and curls on the stag loor. Colored spotlights illuminate the mist in an eerie fashion verall effect is the touristy Where's NY? high-gloss production ears young, with a glint in his eye and very comfortable with his ow ffect. He wears a white linen suit with a red rose in the breas ocket. Like an elder Carl Sagan, he addresses the group.
_HAMMOND
"Welcome, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to an ancient and mysterious world, a world long before humankind inhabited it with all out remarkable dreams and questions. Enter a world that existed one hundred million years ago. When our changing earth was the abode of magnificent creations. Today, the late twentieth century has witnessed a scientific gold rush of astonishing proportions: the headlong and furious haste to un"
ravel the mystery
"of genetic engineering has become more than just a subject for science fiction writers."
ON GRANT - he whispers to Ellie.
_GRANT
"- the furious haste to commercialize genetic engineering."
BACK ON HAMMOND - he warms to his subject.
_HAMMOND
"Biotechnology promises the greatest revolution in human history. It will outdistance atomic power and computers in its effects on our everyday lives. We'll see square trees for easy lumbering and white trout for super visibility to fisherman. Why it will transform every aspect of human life: out medical care, our food, our health, even our very entertainment."
ON GRANT - confirmed in his thinking, he whispers again.
_GRANT
"Here we go."
BACK ON HAMMOND - he concludes.
_HAMMOND
 
Nothing will ever be the same again.
"It's literally going to change the face of our planet as we know it."
MUSIC SOARS. Hammond smiles appreciatively, removes his rose. A scree escends behind him.
_HAMMOND
 ... Jurassic Park. What we do here is
"made possible through the miracle of DNA replication, commonly known as cloning. To explain what cloning means, I'm going to need my own clone - John Hammond."
Another Hammond appears, projected on the screen beside the real one.
 2ND HAMMOND
"Hi, John!"
_HAMMOND
"Hi, John."
IN THE AUDIENCE - Ellie laughs aloud. Grant, shaking his head, smiles ACK ON HAMMOND - The original speaks to the clone.
_HAMMOND
"Okay John, hold out your finger."
 2ND HAMMOND
"Why?"
_HAMMOND
"I need some of your"
genetic material.
 2ND HAMMOND
"Now just a minute here, John."
_HAMMOND
"Your genetic material is the same in every cell of your body. You have a hundred billion cells. You won't miss a couple."
Hammond holds his rose to the screen the pricks his clone's finger wit  thorn.
 2ND HAMMOND
"OW!!! That hurt! Hey, what's -"
The clone dissolves into a cascade of blood as WE SEE a magnified vie f the bloodstream. ANIMATION begins which illuminates the parts of th lood and its actions. Hammond provides voiceover for the visuals.
_HAMMOND
"John, let's look into your blood, the river of life. There's your white cells, exquisitely evolved to clean up bodily wastes. And there's a mighty nucleus, the heart and brain of a cell. This nucleus has an amazing property. It can sp"
lit in half and reproduce itself.
"That's how it grows. And then those two can do it again. And again. Making copy after copy of itself."
Back to the two Hammond's. Joined by a third, then a fourth, and so o ntil the screen is crammed with Hammond's, elbowing each other for room.
_NEW HAMMOND'S
"Hi, I'm John Hammond. Hey, I'm John Hammond. No, I am. I am."
_HAMMOND
"Come on, that's enough of this! And I thought to reproduce myself I had to do it the old-fashioned way."
New mist fades out this show. The lights go up. Regis applauds. Gran oins in the laughter with Ellie and Gennaro ammond jumps down from the stage and greets Gennaro and Regis.
_HAMMOND
"That's all we've got so far. A lot of fun, isn't it, Mr. Gennaro?"
_REGIS
"You bet!"
Hammond greets Grant and Ellie warmly. Then ammond baits Grant.
_HAMMOND
"It's been a long time, Alan. I know the preceding was not your sort of enter- tainment. Popular science -"
_GRANT
"No, I don't mind popular science. I dislike the commercialization of science. It breeds a sloppiness, a disregard for method."
_HAMMOND
"Well, I don't disregard method. But think of mutation - which is nothing more than sloppy communication on the cellular level. Think how triumphant mutations have been in natural selection. Oh, but I know what you're saying. It's true that I have never been afraid to make money with science. I've always considered profit to be a measure of success, a barometer of public reaction."
_GRANT
"Mr. Hammond, the essential truth of a scientific law ha"
s nothing to do with
"public reaction. Water freezes at thirty-two degrees, whether you pay for it or not."
Hammond turns to Gennaro. Gennaro smiles nervously at their clash.
_HAMMOND
"Donald, in bringing my old friend, Alan Grant, you've brought an excellent critic to observe the viability of my island and out venture. I look forward to winning you over, Dr. Grant."
_ELLIE
"Just what is it you're trying to clone?"
EXT A SPRAWLING LAWN - DA utside, Hammond leads Gennaro, Grant and Ellie. He points out th taff living quarters, a group of graceful teepees. Next to thei omes, WORKERS hang laundry and cook on grills hey pass a large Mechanical Building. The generator housed within i ery LOUD. The wind increases, rippling clothes uddenly, the SOUND of a speeding jeep. Grant turns acing across the rolling green landscape is A RED JEEP. Muldoon is  he steering wheel. Two kids bounce happily around in the open jeep hey are TIMMY, 9, and LEX, 6, brother and sister. The jeep stops.
_LEX
"Grandpa!"
Hammond looks up, delighted. Arms open. Gennaro pulls him close.
_GENNARO
(incredulous)
"Mr. Hammond, this is a serious investiga- tion of the island, not a weekend excursion or a social outing. We're talking about the safety of this place!"
Hammond waves to the children.
_HAMMOND
"I'm aware of that. But I built this place for children. You can't investigate it without their reactions. They're what this place is all about."
Hammond beams to Grant and Ellie and indicates the running kids.
_HAMMOND
"My grandchildren. Genetics were kind. They're more like my ex-wife than me."
Lex jumps right into her Grandpa's arms. Timmy  yly walks up an mbraces him. Hammond shines. Gennaro holds in his fury NT HAMMOND'S QUARTERS - DA ammond ushers his guests into his own richly appointed baronial suite llie looks out a small window at the tee-pees and the contrastin ifestyle below. She then focuses on the high fence, circling th erimeter of Hammond's quarters. Above is a skylight, with metal bars rant whispers to her, indicating the obviously modified window frame.
_GRANT
"Who makes a windows ... smaller?"
Timmy smacks him forehead, points to Grant.
_TIMMY
"I know you. You wrote my book. Lost World of The Dinosaurs. It's awesome."
_LEX
"Timmy's got dinosaurs on the brain."
_GRANT
"Don't worry - he'll grow out of it."
_ELLIE
"Dr. Grant's embarrassed that his book was so widely successful. He wrote if for gra"
duate students ammond smiles intensely. But he's patient. He stands be a huge tabl overed with a sumptuous velvet drape.
_HAMMOND
"Although Dr. Grant suspects otherwise, this is not an ill-conceived, half-baked, poorly funded plan that I've headed. This is a plan to which I committed all of my personal resources, literally billions of dollars. And Donald Gennaro here has kindly helped me raise that sum again from wealthy Japanese. They love theme parks. I have recruited pre- eminent scientific minds from hallowed universities and we've taken the time to do things right."
Lex peeks under the cloth. Hammond smiles at her and recovers the table.
_HAMMOND
"Jurassic Park is the most advanced amusement park in the world. We work with genetics - life's essential building blocks - to create new "
worlds. I set out
"to make biological attractions. Living attractions. Attractions so astonishing that they'd capture the imagination of the entire world."
_GRANT
"What exactly do you mean ... biological attractions?"
_HAMMOND
"As you well know, long ago, creatures ten times larger than whales roamed our adolescent Earth. And then mass, mysterious extinction created a time barrier unscalable until ... now."
BEAT.
_GRANT
"Yes?"
_HAMMOND
"Dinosaurs."
(superbly proud)
"I've been cloning dinosaurs!"
CAMERA PUSHES IN on Grant's incredulous face ammond whips off the drape, revealing a complex and detailed scal odel of the entire resort.
_HAMMOND
"Ladies and Gentlemen, Jurassic Park. Not a resort, not a scien"
tific conservatory,
"just a little piece of pre-history that every child in the whole wide world will insist on visiting."
Hammond grins with delight.
_GENNARO
"At least every rich child."
Grant and Ellie come forward to examine the model. The kids crowd in AMERA SNORKELS through the model - revealing different enclosures wit iniature dinosaurs, moats, fences, roads, a river.
_HAMMOND
"Apatosaurs in the lowland. Gallimimus in the grassy plain. Dilophosaurus above the river. The mighty Tyrannosaurus Rex!"

fabulous creatures so far!
_TIMMY
"Real dinosaurs, Grandpa? Don't they want to just kill each other?"
Hammond excitedly punches a button - colored display grids light up.
_HAMMOND
"Timmy, there's electric fences and moats and video surveillance at all times. There"
are monitors every hundred feet
"whatever we could plant them on the island. A computer to tabulate it all."
_ELLIE
"You created dinosaurs? Who gave you the right to do that?"
_HAMMOND
"I didn't create them. I found a way to wake them up, to stir them out of their prehistoric slumber."
_GRANT
"We don't have the science. There's no source of dinosaur DNA."
Hammond's proud, excited face shifts to one that divulges modestly.
_HAMMOND
"Yes ... there is."
INT HALLWAY, UPPER FLOOR, VISITOR'S CENTER - DA ammond leads Grant, Ellie, Gennaro, Timmy, and Lex out of an elevato nd down an endless corridor. A WORKMAN ON CRUTCHES passes them hey go through a series of security doors. To get them open, Hammon laces his palm on a screen before each door. Each time, it lights u ith an x-ray-like image of is hand and each door HISSES open LOSEUP - Security x-ray. of Hammond's hand. BEEP. A red line write hrough the screen. Can't get in. Complaining, under his breath:
_HAMMOND
"Glitches."
Hammond tries again NT CONTROL ROOM - DA he door HISSES open, revealing an elaborate technology-crammed room n dim light, clusters of computer consoles and video monitors glow edry sits in a corner at a keyboard with a pile of papers next to him yping away. JOHN ARNOLD, 45, park supervisor, sits directing th ctivities of the park and chain-smoking. There are large window ooking out to the park, one of which is cracked and being replaced fro he outside by a TEAM OF WORKMEN ammond wears a big smile as he leads in his entourage. He's th ingmaster.
_HAMMOND
"And this is the right side of my brain. The entire park is safely controlled from here. John Arnold, that genius over there, is the m"
aster control operator with genuine concern)
"John, don't smoke so much, you're far too valuable a man to me."
_ARNOLD
"Oh, you'd survive just fine without me."
Arnold exhales smoke and waves good-naturedly. Nedry stares darkly a ammond, who ignores him.
_HAMMOND
"Everything's controlled from here. Remote everything. Cars, feeding programs, medicine dispensers, fecal clean up - and that can be tons in a park like this. We run this place with twenty workers. This computer does it all. And it polices each and every single animal out there."
_ELLIE
(whispers to Grant)
"Who polices the computer?"
Hammond points up. Overlooking the control room and the park is  aised platform with a huge chair, like a throne in a court. A larg ideo screen faces this chair.
 
HAMMOND
"That's where I will watch the astonished watchers. Okay, let's go."
They practically race as a group to keep up with Hammond. The securit oor seals shit, leaving Nedry and Arnold alone again.
_NEDRY
"Thanks for the kind word, Mr. Hammond."
_ARNOLD
"Come on, Dennis, he knows your technical contributions have made it all possible."
_NEDRY
"Right."
BACK ON HALLWAY  ammond and his group turn off the corridor and reach a door marked AUTION: Teratogenic Substances. Timmy backs off, grabs Lex's arm.
_TIMMY
"That stuff turns you into a mutant!"
He contorts his face into strange shapes. As Hammond leads them all i ex pulls on his pocket.
_HAMMOND
"Don't mind the signs. They're only legal precautions."
Gennaro frowns. The door opens and Lex peeks in.
 
"HAMMOND My laboratory, Lex. It will be yours and Timmy's someday."
INT AMBER ROOM, LABORATORY - CONTINUING ACTIO rant and Ellie share a baffled look. Grant stares rant's POV - PAN ACROSS a room filled with honey-colored glowing stone rranged on glass shelves in large pull-out trays. Each stone is tagge nd numbered rant leans down, studying the stones. He bumps right into Gennaro ex jumps excitedly.
_LEX
"It's ... gold!"
_TIMMY
"It's amber. Fossilized tree sap."
_LEX
"Grandpa found gold."
Grant shushes the kids and looks to Hammond.
_HAMMOND
"You're both right. Amber is our gold. The alpha or our alchemic alphabet. The precious course of our genetic material. You already know amber is the fossilized resin of prehistoric tree sap, of course."
Grant and Ellie nod impatiently. ammond sets the scene.
_HAMMOND
"Imagine - millions of years ago, tree sap flowing over insects, as it does now as I speak, in thousands of forests and backyard trees everywhere. Imagine that ancient sap trapping a little struggling insect and consuming it in a syrupy death. Millions and millions of years pass and we come along and discover this prehistoric insect. If we're lucky, he's perfectly preserved in a fossil form inside the hardened sap which is now amber. And as we examine more and more amber, we find many perished insects, including among them, biting insects -"
_GRANT
"Like mosquitos -"
_HAMMOND
"Like mosquitos, precisely, Dr. Grant."
_GRANT
"Mosquitos that sucked the blood of dinosaurs. That's your source of DNA"

material? My God! It just might work NT EXTRACTION ROOM, LABORATOR  TECHNICIAN carefully positions a piece of amber under a fine-pointe rill. With a nod, the technician's goggles drop from his forehead ont is eyes and he starts up the drill. Hammond yells over the loud WHIRR.
_HAMMOND
"The extraction room speaks for itself."
CLOSE ON - drillbit boring into the amber. Orange fleck fly.
_GRANT
"It does?"
The technician shuts the drill. Placing his hands into a mounted pai f gloves, he operates an automated pair of needle-nose pliers t arefully lift out the remains of a mosquito. He drops this bug on  lide and places this slide on a tray full of such slides.
_LEX
"That's a million year old mosquito?"
A conveyor belt starts, carrying this tray on to the NEXT TECHNICIAN he group follows. This technician puts the first slide under  icroscope. Grant watches on a video monit  as the tech inserts a lon eedle into the prehistoric bug.
_ELLIE
"Put in a piece of amber, find a mosquito, drill it out. Right?"
_HAMMOND
"Right. You are witnessing the extraction of tissue from the thorax of this humble insect. If this mosquito has ingested any foreign red blood cells - say it bit a hadrosaur or a stegosaurus or a T-Rex - we will extract those blood cells and obtain paleo-DNA, the how-to-build instruction book of an extinct creature. So you see, Ellie, I'm not creating dino- saurs. Fossils left behind the information, the map of how to bring them back. I'm helping them escape from the confined of time."
_GRANT
"But even thousands of mosquitos wouldn't give you enough tissue to determine a complete DNA strand."
 
"HAMMOND Right you are, Dr. Grant! More like hundreds of thousands of mosquitos are necessary to provide even a partial strand of DNA. And without a complete strand, we don't have a dinosaur."
INT GENETICS ROO  LOUD HUMMING SOUND. Along the walls are rows of waist-high stainles teel boxes. In the room's center are two six-foot-high round towers t a single console, a man studies a monitor R. WU, 35, looks up from his study and beams at his guests. He jump p and knocks over his cup of coffee. ASSISTANTS clean the area as W omes forward and actually hugs Grant, much to Grant's embarrassment.
_HAMMOND
"Ah, I knew you two would hit it off! Dr. Grant, this is Dr. Wu, my chief geneticist."
_WU
"Finally, you are here! I've been working without the encouragement of my peers for too long. Welcome, welcome!"
He kisses Ellie, who takes t in stride. Gennaro, We already knows.
_WU
"Mr. Hammond never lets me publish and he's interested only in results, not in science."
_HAMMOND
"Don't forget to thank me when you pick up your Nobel prize."
Hammond and Wu resume the tour.
_HAMMOND
"You are standing in the middle of the most powerful genetics factory created since the expulsion from Eden."
_WU
"These are Hamachi-Hood automated gene sequencers, those are Cray XMP's, supercomputers that take DNA information and organize it. In this room, we take fragmented or incomplete DNA strands and compare them to other incomplete strands."
_HAMMOND
"It's like finding the missing pieces of a jigsaw puzzle."
_WU
"The computers make sever"
al trillion
"calculations to provide us with a complete DNA strand - the genetic code of an extinct animal."
INT INCUBATION ROOM, LABORATOR  vast room bathed in infrared light, filled with long tables. Th irst tables have rows and rows of centrifuges, each bearing dozens o est tubes. Wu leads the group.
_GRANT
"Okay, you have your "complete" DNA strand. How do you grow it?"
_WU
"We use unfertilized crocodile ova as our breeding medium."
_HAMMOND
"Our primordial soup."
_GRANT
"And how do you know what it is you're growing?"
Wu shrugs.
_WU
"Well, we have computer techniques to try and map out finds on an evolutionary basis. But mostly, we just grow it and find out what it is. If it's something we're interested in, and it "
survives, we
"keep it."
Grant and Ellie share a concerned look.
_GENNARO
"And if you're not interested?"
Wu indicates a cabinet of chemicals with skull-and-crossbone warnings immy regards the poison with excitement ex calls from deeper in the room.
_LEX
"Come look!"
Here, plastic eggs lay on the long tables, their pale outlines obscure y a grey mist that covers the tables. The eggs are all gently rockin s TECHNICIANS roam up and down the aisles ammond walks ahead of the group. As Wu speaks, Hammond listens an njoys it as though he's hearing it for the first time.
_WU
"This is the incubation room. We keep the temperature at ninetynine degrees and a relative humidity of one hundred percent."
_GRANT AND TIMMY
"Jurassic atmosphere."
Timmy smiles at Grant. Hammond winks at Timmy.
_WU
"We"
also run a high oxygen concentration,
"up to thirty-three percent, so if you feel faint, please tell me right away."
Lex feigns a faint, Timmy cracks a small smile. They move forward aist-deep in the mist. A strange green light emanates from th ncubators. Lex is half-consumed by the mist. She mimics the witch.
_LEX
"I'm ... melting!"
Ellie laughs and pulls Lex close.
_WU
"Reptile eggs contain large amounts of yolk but no water at all. The embryos must extract water from the surrounding environment."
_GRANT
"That's why you create the mist."
Wu nods. Hammond just enjoys the scene as Grant and Ellie watch  hermal sensor moving from one egg to the next, touching each with  lexible wand, beeping. Lex and Timmy let their hands glide over th ides of the green glowing incubators fully awed by the strange, bi ggs they hold.
 
WU
"Children, please do not touch! The eggs are permeable to skin oils."
Grant that very close to an egg. He sniffs it.
_GRANT
"What kind of eggs are these? Are these shells plastic?"
_WU
"Yes, they are, The embryos are mechanically inserted and then hatched in this room. But we've managed to sufficiently mimic the actual biological process - these creatures rupture the plastic membrane that they're contained in when they're born. Like real births."
They reach an endless row of incubators, lined up along the wall eneath a viewing area like those found in an OB-GYN ward.
_WU
"Eggs that are determined viable spend their last couple days in our specially- designed incubators, which help accelerate the pre-natal developmental stages. Which is interesting becaus"
e
"we're having a problem with the adult animals -"
Hammond claps a hand over Wu's mouth and laughs.
_HAMMOND
"There's no problem Dr. Wu can't handle. Now who wants to see the real thing?"
As they exit the CAMERA PANS the misty aisles, studying the eggs XT VISITOR'S CENTER - DA lue shadows of clouds sweep across an expansive green hill in front o he Visitor's Center rant and Hammond make their way down below to the loading area for th ark tour. A little ahead is Gennaro and Ellie. Gennaro chatters o hile Ellie energetically explores the area, looking at the plants.
_GENNARO
 ... so naturally, Hammond's going to
"present everything in the best light. I need to know that this park is safe."
_ELLIE
"I'll tell you something that troubles me from the start. The carnivores are all well-fed and kept separated from their natural prey. That'll keep 'em alive, but it won't keep 'em happy."
_GENNARO
"How do you mean?"
_ELLIE
"The carnivores will want to hunt. It's an instinct. And that instinct will have to be satisfied or suppressed."
FURTHER UP THE HILL, moving slowly, Hammond eyes the pair suspiciously.
_HAMMOND
"Gennaro is putting negative ideas into Ellie's head. He's a naysayer. I have no affection for that type of thinking."
_GRANT
"Don't worry. Ellie makes her own judgments."
At the base of the hill Timmy and Lex toss a baseball XT TOUR START - DA he group gathers. TWO ELECTRIC CARS glide to a stop behind them egis leans out of the first one.
_REGIS
"Hey! Great day for a tour!"
_GENNARO
"Looks like rain to me."

_REGIS
"No! I told the rain-god to hold it off till we got back."
The kids pile in next to Regis and explore the high-tech cars. Timm inds a a pair of very think, strange-looking goggles with dials on top rant, Ellie, and Gennaro climb in the second car.
_HAMMOND
"Kids, mind Mr. Regis. He's in charge now."
The cars begin to move and pass Hammond. He waves ennaro looks back as the cars turn into the brush. Hammond waves.
_HAMMOND
"Gennaro, for once in your life, let something really move you."
In the cruiser, Gennaro rubs his neck. He turns to Grant.
_GENNARO
"Ever get the feeling we're just Hammond's damn guinea pigs?"
_GRANT
"I like to wait and see."
Ellie motions ahead, with excitement and apprehension, to a huge gate egis and the kids wave behind to Grant, Ellie and Gennaro he gate's do s swing open and the cruisers move forward. The kid queal out a YA-HOO that floats through the air to Grant. But Gran ears a cautious face, his skeptical eyes scan the landscape  FANFARE of trumpets and then a pre-recorded voice speaks from  onsole in each cruiser. Video screens display a welcome message.
_PRE-RECORDED VOICE
"Welcome to Jurassic Park. You are now entering the lost world of the prehistoric past, a world of mighty creatures long gone from the face of the earth, which you are privileged to see for the first time ..."
Regis uses his walkie-talkie to contact Grant's cruiser.
_REGIS (ON WALKIE)
"That's Richard Kiley. We spared no expense."
_PRE-RECORDED VOICE
"We'll begin our tour today with the herbivores ..."

All eyes swing that way. Grant doesn't see a thing. Nor do the others HEAD, Timmy pulls the binoculars out of the equipment pouch and studie he location. Lex grabs the night goggles. Timmy pulls them from her.
_REGIS
"Look ..."
_LEX AND TIMMY
"I don't see anything. Do you see anything? There's nothing there."
_REGIS
"Something's out there ..."
IN THE SECOND CAR, a fly buzzes on Grant's windshield. Grant hangs ou is window almost sniffing the air for some movement. Nothing UDDENLY the trees in front of them move! A deep trumpeting SOUND an WO BRACHIOSAURS rumble away f m the side of the road. The groun HAKES as they walk, their BELLOWING fills the air. Led by Grant, th assengers rise through the open top of their Land Cruisers, to look u t the dinosaurs far above ROOPING FROM ABOVE, leaves and little branches shower on Grant. Utte mazement fills Grant's face, then his mouth breaks into a giant smil hen a laugh. He simply can't believe his eyes. His laugh become aucous and euphoric.
_GRANT
"Ellie! Can you imagine the excavation team seeing this!"
Behind him, Ellie's whole person is awestruck, immobile. Gennar quints, straining to make sense of this unbelievable reality N THE CAR AHEAD, Lex and Timmy stare open-mouthed. Regis looks at th nimal and then at the group's reverie. He smiles knowingly: he's bee here, too. He bends and whispers:
_REGIS
"Congratulations. You're the first kids in the whole wide world ever to see real dinosaurs."
Th ids look up at Regis with wonder in their eyes RANT CAN'T stop laughing. Still chewing, a brachiosaur cranes down t eer at this laughing man. The brachiosaur's huge head stops inche way from Grant. Grant, awestruck, stares and them  LOSE ON - Grant as his eyes slowly roll back and ... he faints he dinosaur casually moves away as Ellie comes to Grant's aid.
_ELLIE
"Alan? Alan?"
(sort of delighted)
"He fainted!"
Gennaro waves to Regis that all is okay. Grant slowly revives. H ooks back at the brachiosaur, groggily, smiling away. He looks a llie and their eyes linger on each other longer than usual, sharing  ook of serene delight ennaro plops back in his seat and ponders the scene before him.  lazed look fills his face.

_HAMMOND
"He fainted. I've waited fifteen years to impress that young man."
_ARNOLD
"Oh Mr. Hammond, I'm sorry to interrupt you, but Muldoon needs you by the pit."
_HAMMOND
"Oh, balls."
INT/EXT CRUISERS, SECOND TOUR STOP - DA he cruisers come to a stop. In the distance, A HERD OF GALLIMIMU raze. They stand on their hind legs to get at high palm trees, the rop gracefully down on all fours to chew. BABY GALLIMIMUS scampe round the adults, eating leaves that drop from the larger animals.
_PRE-RECORDED VOICE
 ... Gallimimus, known as the ostrich
"dinosaur for the shape of its shoulders, have a very strong nesting instinct ..."
Grant d sn't listen. He is simply intoxicated with the pastoral beaut f the gentle, grazing dinosaurs. Suddenly, he looks away with a dee oncern. Ellie looks at him questioningly.
_GRANT
"Ellie? What the hell are we going to do with the rest of our lives?"
Ellie smiles at him, puzzled.
_ELLIE
"What to you mean?"
_GRANT
"Can't you see it, Ellie? We're the ones that are extinct now."
INT/EXT CRUISERS, THIRD TOUR STOP - DAY
_PRE-RECORDED VOICE
 ... lots more to see in the herbivore
"section of our park. But as we come alongside out Jurassic jungle river to the left, let's try and catch a glimpse of a very unusual and dangerous carnivore. Look across the river and above ..."
A lovely mossy clearing. And to the side, bounded just by a thicket o ushes, a precipitous drop to a tropical river, lu  and clear. Th iver runs fast but it is narrow. On the other side is a sharp rise.
_PRE-RECORDED VOICE
"And there they are!"
Standing on that natural pedestal and watching our tour come to a sto re TWO DILOPHOSAURUS, man-sized dinosaurs with gills that hang aroun heir necks. Grant and Ellie chime in with the pre-recorded voice.
_ALL THREE
"Dilophosaurus!"
Timmy and Lex point enthusiastically. Regis holds them down with  entle but restraining arm.
_PRE-RECORDED VOICE
"Dilophosaurus is one of the earliest carnivores. Scientists once thought their jaw muscles were too weak to kill, but now, through the miracle of their cloning, we know Dilophosaurs spit venom, a poison which causes blindness and then unconsciousness."
Their distinctive HOOT drifts across the afternoon air.
_GENNARO
"Poisonous d"
inosaurs, there's a liability

CLOSEUP of the nearly motionless Dilophosaurus. One yawns wide.
_GRANT
(assessing)
"It's like a Gila monster of a cobra. It's a poison ..."
_ELLIE
"Spitter!"
The Spitters bound off as Grant watches, transfixed. A flock of bird urst from a tree and cross the sky. Trees filter the light.
_ELLIE
"Are we dreaming all this?"
EXT RAPTOR PIT - DA  big hole in the ground, covered with a think wire mesh. Suddenly,  ark claw pushes against the wire web. A SHOWER OF SPARKS. A SCREEC nimals GROWL and SNARL. An animal slams its face into the mesh. SPARK lluminate a set of RAZOR-SHARP TEETH uldoon stands next to the pit, carefully loading an assault rifle ammond comes in a hurry. Muldoon sees Hammond and puts down the rifle e walks to Hammond, talking before he gets there.
 
"MULDOON These raptors are too damn dangerous. One of them tunneled out this morning. He ripped a boy's arm off before I could get a bullet in him."
_HAMMOND
"A bullet? Muldoon - no! Now what? I have five left?"
_MULDOON
"John, they're mean as scorpions and smart as chimps. Their little fingers make them natural cage-breakers. We should terminate the raptor program. They're just too smart. Too damn smart."
_HAMMOND
"Oh balls. I will not terminate the raptors just because they're behaving normally. They're hunters. Why can't we contain them properly?"
Hammond starts to walk away. Muldoon follows, he's not finished at all.
_MULDOON
"John, remember back in '88, when we started to build the containment devices?"

We ordered cattle prods, tasers, guns
"that blow out electric nets. They're all too slow for these guys. If we're going to keep the raptors, I want TOW missiles and laser-guided devices."
Hammond laughs warmly. He pats Muldoon on the back.
_HAMMOND
"It's just a zoo, Muldoon. A zoo. Figure out a way to contain them. And we'll sit down and have a nice long discussion about raptors - after my guests leave, okay?"
Hammond walks away. Muldoon stares after him, jingling keys in hi and. Muldoon lumps over to A WORKER.
_MULDOON
"Okay! Get a 'dozer, start digging round the pit. We're gonna bury some fence. And wear your rifle when you're working!"
INT CONTROL ROOM - AFTERNOO ammond enters and crosses to his throne. Hammond swivels to Arnold wh xhales smoke. Nedry looks over, keeps typing.
_HAMMOND
"Wh"
ere are they? Punch 'em up.
_ARNOLD
"They'll be by the trike's in a moment. Trike's sick again."
_HAMMOND
"How can you say it so matter-of-factly? The trike's. You casually accept it, but I never can. You know what it means when you say "by the trikes"? "By the trike's" means that they're out there by the species: triceratops horridus. It astounds me every time what I've done here. What magic, what alchemy. We turned a piece of a rock into a dinosaur. I will never be complacent about that."
Arnold smiles and punches a button. WE HEAR the pre-recorded tour voic nd some chatter of the kids AVESDROPPING on the tour IS INTERRUPTED by a radio transmission to th ontrol room. Arnold slides over and shuts off the tour monitoring he picture on the video screen is now of a cargo boat at a dock.
_RADIO

Hello, John. This is the Anne B at the
"dock. I'm looking at the storm patterns just south of us. Requesting permission to leave before unloading the last three food containers."
Nedry looks up quickly, listening carefully.
_RADIO
"Don't want to be stuck here if this chop gets much worse."
Hammond reacts with quiet dismay. Nedry quietly gets up.
_NEDRY
"Coffee anyone?"
He's ignored. Arnold defers to Hammond who leans to the microphone.
_HAMMOND
"Hello skipper, John Hammond, how are you tonight? I certainly don't want to imperil anyone. But can you give us one more container of food? Then we'll feel comfortable is the storm delays your return. Could you help us out here? Of course, if it looks too choppy just go, but you'd be doing us a big favor."
 
"RADIO Well ... we'll do our best, sir. We'll get one more container off. How's that?"
Hammond thanks him and signs off. Arnold looks at the darkening clouds NT/EXT CRUISERS, FOURTH TOUR STOP - LATE AFTERNOO he cars twist through dense vegetation with a GRINDING of gears. Th irst car comes to a jerky stop here is a huge TRICERATOPS lying on its side, moving very slowly reathing laboriously. HARDING, the tall, balding park vet, kneels o he ground. He peers into the animal's mouth with a large flashlight efore the second car can stop completely, Grant leaps out, races to th rike. Regis tries to restrain the kids but they chase Grant and Ellie rant joins Harding on the ground. The trike lets out a low MOAN he's too sick to move. Ellie and Lex squat by the animal.
_LEX
"I feel so sorry for her. She's so sick."
_VET
"We don't know what's wrong with Freda. Every six we"
eks she gets like this.
_REGIS
"Oh, she'll be up and around in no time. After a big night, I feel the same way."
Grant very gently opens the Trike's mouth.
_GRANT
"Poor girl. What's the matter? Ellie, look at this."
A dark purple tongue droops limply from her mouth. Ellie shines th ight on it, illuminating silvery blisters. Gennaro turns away.
_ELLIE
"Microvesicles. Interesting."
Grant scratches one of the blisters with his ball-point pen. It oozes he kids share a grossed-out look.
_LEX
"Doesn't she have a mommy and a daddy?"
_HARDING
"We make these dinosaurs in the lab, sweetheart. But they do form attachments. Freda has a little one that follows her around, thinks Freda's his mom."
Grant starts to look around.
_ELLIE
"What does sh"
e eat? Where does she feed?
_HARDING
"Animal this size takes in a minimum of six hundred pounds of plants a day. We truck in hay and meadow grasses seven times a day. That's all she touches."
Grant studies the nearby grass and bushes. Timmy quietly follows Grant llie lifts a huge eyelid on the triceratops. A runny eye just stares rant comes up triumphantly with a bouquet of weeds clutched in hi and. These weeds have little purple berries. Ellie looks over.
_ELLIE
"West Indian Lilacs!"
_GRANT
"These'd give anybody a stomachache."
_HARDING
"I'm telling you, the animals don't eat don't eat that stuff."
Regis keeps a babysitter's eye on the kids. Timmy comes up with  andful of smooth stones. He approaches Grant shyly.
_TIMMY
"Dr. Grant, sir? How 'bout these? There'"
s lots of little piles of these rant fingers one distractedly, then suddenly comes to attention.
_GRANT
"Hey, Ellie take a look at his. Good work, Timmy."
Ellie gets up, brushes herself off, comes over and examines the stone.
_ELLIE
"Extremely smooth. Purple stains, could be those lilac berries."
She and Grant smile and each other and nod. Gennaro is curious.
_HARDING
"I don't get it."
_GRANT
"Looks like your trike swallows stones to help her digest her food. Walking around, she crushes berries against the stones. And even just a little crushed berry is eventually enough,"
_ELLIE
"So, she poisons herself periodically."
_HARDING
"Bet we tested her saliva for any trace of -"
_GRANT
"But with th"
e stones, she swallows them
"and probably bypasses any mucosal contact. Straight to the stomach. I would test her excrement."
_LEX
"Yo, yuk!"
A light RAIN begins. Automatically, with a soft hiss, the glass roof f the cruisers slide shit. Gennaro taps Regis and indicates the cars.
_GENNARO
"Hey Regis, where are your rain gods? It's gonna pour. Let's finish our tour."
Grant agrees, heads for the cruisers. He turns and looks for Ellie llie stands by the Trike. She gives Grant a meaningful look.
_ELLIE
"I'm staying."
Grant smiles at her decision.
_GRANT
"Soil samples?"
_ELLIE
"You read my mind."
(confidentially)
"I think she's sicker then they're saying. Her skin is dry and flaky. And her gums are pale. I'm going to talk to Dr. Wu."

_GRANT
"Good idea. I'll keep my eyes open."
Gennaro climbs in with Grant. The two cruisers start off and Timm urns backward to stare wistfully at Grant. Regis and Lex wave to th rike.

"Would if she could, believe me. Some- times she stands by the lagoon and stares at those animals, and wiggles those little forearms of hers in frustration. But the T-Rex territory is completely enclosed with trenches and fences. Believe me, she can't go anywhere."
_GRANT
"Then where is she?"
They hear A SOFT BLEATING. In the center of the field, a small cag ises into view, lifted on hydraulics from underground. The cage bar lide down. A GOAT remains tethered in the field, BLEATING plaintively he tour group stares out their windows, expectantly ACK ON CONTR  ROOM  ammond, pleased, watches the giant screen that displays the tour group uldoon limps into the control room. Arnold looks over.
_MULDOON
"Just checking in. Everything ok?"
_HAMMOND
"Look at them. Leaning out the windows, so eager. They can't wait to see it. They have come for the danger."
_MULDOON
"That's what I'm afraid of."
Muldoon twirls the keys on his fingers and watches the land cruisers ACK ON CRUISERS, T-REX FEEDING AREA  rant watches quietly he BLEATING becomes louder, more insistent. The goat tugs franticall t its tether, racing back and forth, kicking.
_LEX
"What's going to happen to the goat? Is the T-Rex gonna come eat the goat?"
Grant senses something. He sits straight up. Looks out intently.
_GRANT
"He's here."
The goat is tethered in the middle of the f ld, thirty yards from th earest tree. Grant scans the tree for the T-Rex he goat senses something too. It struggles and strains, bleatin rantically. Suddenly the mechanical SOUND of the cage coming up. It ars surround the goat with safety once again.
_REGIS
"Looks like the Rex will have its snack a little later today."
_RECORDED VOICE
"The sensors don't see the Rex around. She usually comes within five minutes of hearing dinner. If she doesn't, that means she's sleeping - we might have access to her at the picnic area."
Lex and Timmy let out a sigh of relief. The tension is gone.
_LEX
"I didn't want to see him get eaten. I liked the goat."
BACK IN THE CONTROL ROOM  ammond studies the large video monitor. He watches Grant and Gennaro heir voices are heard in the control room.
_GENNARO (MONITOR
ED)
"What is a carnivore got out?"
_GRANT (MONITORED)
"There'd be no stopping it. Huge, with no natural enemies, and a suppressed hunting instinct."
Hammond glares. Arnold, aware, shuts off the screen.
_HAMMOND
"Damn those people. They are so negative."
_ARNOLD
"It's natural. They can't fully appreciate that we've engineered the animals and the park for total safety."
_HAMMOND
"They comb this island like a bunch of accountants. They don't experience the wonder, the awe of it all."
_ARNOLD
"You can't make people experience wonder."
Hammond gets up and stands before the big windows overlooking the park he quartz FLOODLIGHTS outside their area COME ON with a rosy glow an he dark jungle is opened again to their inspection t his console, Nedry looks at Ham nd. Hammond stares out the window he RAIN PICKS UP and bounces off the window. Hammond speaks to Arnol ithout turning.
_HAMMOND
"It's like the Garden of Eden out there. This is the most beautiful time of day."
_ARNOLD
"Better rout the tour back. They can start again sun-up tomorrow morning."
_HAMMOND
"Yup. Call the kitchen. Those kids'll be hungry when they get in."
Arnold picks up the phone. STATIC. He glances over at Nedry.
_NEDRY
"Sorry 'bout that. I've taken all the lines to upload some data."
Hammond's annoyed, but contains it. Arnold looks at Nedry, who smiles.
_NEDRY
"I'll clear a couple of lines for you at the end of the next transmission, sir. Here you go now, this will make it all better, Mr. Hammond."
Nedry punches in a code LOSE ON  Nedry's fat finger punching a last key LOSE ON - amber video display terminal as a countdown begins s the screen counts down from ten to zero, Nedry peers at Hammond wit  steely glint in his eyes ACK ON SCREEN - three, two, one, the countdown hits zero edry's data-filled screen blinks off. Nedry looks up to the rack o onitors. Unnoticed by Hammond or Arnold two more monitors go blank hen a third one ACK ON CRUISERS, REST AREA - NIGH he electric cars turn up into a scenic area high above the rest of th ark. HUGE QUARTZ LIGHTS REVEAL a dramatic view down to the ocean here the supply ship, the ANNE B, unloads its last crates AIN INCREASES. On the other side of the road are picnic tables, a nfinished snack bar and rest rooms. To the side of this rest area is  iew of the interior of the island. A guard-rail separates visitor o the other side of the rest area is a concrete moat and in the back o his is a tall, electrified fence. Surrounding the electric fence is  maller protective fence.
_PRE-RECORDED VOICE
 ... enjoy a healthy snack. This is also
"a good time to ..."
_LEX
"Hey, is that bathroom working?"
_REGIS
"Sure."
(he uses his walkie)
"Rest stop."
The kids take off towards the bathroom, running through the rain. Gran ets out of his cruiser, strides to Regis. He indicates the fence.
_GRANT
"Is that still the T-Rex paddock?"
_REGIS
"Yes. But she never comes here. I don't know why not. Probably too much construction."
GENNARO, jacket over his head against the rain, looks down to the ocean ENNARO'S POV - THE ANNE B UNLOADS he last cargo crate RANT LOOKS at the concrete moat. Studies its deep curve. He looks u t the tell electrical fence with its 10,000 volt warning. He see onventional power lines on the opposite si  of the road AMERA EXAMINES the empty cruisers. Inside, the pre-recorded voice i hatting on. It slows eerily and stops. Video SCREENS BLINK OUT ACK ON CONTROL ROOM  edry yawns loudly.
_NEDRY
"Yup! Looks like a never-ending weekend for me. I'm gonna get a Diet Coke. Don't touch my console, ok? Line will be clear in five minutes."
Nedry leaves. Hammond swings around and growls under his breath.
_HAMMOND
"Slob!"
_ARNOLD
"Well, at least he knows what he's doing."
INT UPPER FLOOR, VISITOR'S CENTER - NIGH edry races through the series of security doors. He ignores th ecurity x-ray device and just SHOVES each door open with his hand ACK ON CRUISERS, REST AREA  HE QUARTZ LIGHTS GO OUT, leaving the group in shadowy darkness and no TEADY RAIN. There's a ripple of surprise from the group. Regis round hem all up and directs them back into the ruisers.
_REGIS
"Everything's just fine. It's a temporary glitch due to the rain. No doubt, they're going to re-rout some circuits back at the mainframe. We'll have the power back on in moments. Let's get back in the cruisers, they may start up, and I'd like us all to be seated in them."
The cruisers are STILL. IN THE REAR CRUISER, Gennaro turns to Grant.
_GENNARO
"I knew we shouldn't have kids here."
A vivid FLASH of LIGHTNING. IN THE FIRST CAR: Lex covers her eyes hen she looks up at Regis with a frightful face.
_LEX
"Mr. Regis, are dinosaurs ... nocturnal?"
_REGIS
"No, darling, of course not."
_LEX
"Mr. Regis? What's ... nocturnal?"
Another LIGHTNING FLASH. Lex cries. Regis comforts her.
_REGIS
"Don't you worry about d"
inosaurs. They're
"all very safe in their paddocks just like animals in a big, strong zoo. They're not going anywhere we don't tell them to go."
Timmy looks out the window excitedly NT INCUBATION ROOM, LABORATORY - NIGH ll those eggs on tables. No moving sensors. Nedry pulls a portabl ncubator away from the dozens lined up against the wall. It lectrical cord goes flying. Furiously, Nedry fills the incubator wit ggs, one after the other.
_NEDRY
"Okay, little ones! Here we go!"
Nedry grabs the handles of the incubator and runs with it. Th ncubator careens on one wheel as he turns the corner and exits ACK ON CONTROL ROOM  ammond looks out the large window as the LIGHTS EXTINGUISH. He twirls.
_HAMMOND
"What's going on, Arnold? I want those lights on. I don't want my grandchildren scared."
_ARNOLD
"Jesus, the computer's gone"
down.
_HAMMOND
"Well, I want the computer up. This is the wrong weekend for glitches."
Arnold still examines his console. He looks out with worry.
_ARNOLD
"That's not the worst of it."
_HAMMOND
"Oh yeah? Please tell me what's worse than the lights going out?"
Wu smashes through the door.
_WU
"All the security doors are open. Someone has been in my laboratory and the eggs have been disturbed."
The camera pushes in on Hammond's face.
_HAMMOND
"Where the hell is Nedry? Where is he? Did anybody check the damn john?"
Hammond storms out NT CORRIDOR, VISITOR'S CENTER - CONTINUING ACTIO ammond enters the hall. Muldoon, racing from the other direction, yells:
_MULDOON
"John, the generator's shut down. Who cut the power?"

_HAMMOND
"Arnold's on it. You go out and bring back the tour right away. I don't need any of this!"
Muldoon is already running back the way he came NT GARAGE - NIGH everal electric land cruisers are stored in this shadowy room. Ther s a glassed-in area where Muldoon's weapons are stored: assaul ifles, tasers, tear gas canisters o the side of the garage s Muldoon's red jeep. In the passenger sid f the front seat is a rocket launcher edry storms in, wheeling his incubator. He stop suddenly and listens pproaching FOOTSTEPS.

Wit verything he's got, he lifts the incu tor waist-height. And holds it ACK ON MULDOON - Muldoon's footsteps ECHO as they come closer and close o the garage. Muldoon whips down the curve in the stairs. His jacke atches on an incomplete section of banister.

Nedry curses and with one forcefu oost, he lifts the incubator shoulder height LOSE ON - Muldoon's feet on long stairwell. BOOM. BOOM. BOOM ERVOUS, NEDRY BREATHES in a labored fashion. He looks this way an hat. He closes his eyes and with one superhuman effort, he heaves th ncubator into the back seat of the red jeep. Nedry exhales t that moment, MULDOON ENTERS the vestibule between stairs and garage EDRY EYES the shadowy figure in the vestibule. edry's frightened face ULDOON STOPS and reaches in his belt. He pulls out his pistol. H akes out long, shiny cartridges. He loads the pistol EDRY LEAPS in the front of the jeep, pushing aside the rocket launcher nd zooms into the night  moment later, Muldoon enters the garage. He sniffs at the exhaus hat still hangs in the air. He looks over and is surprised to see hi eep gone. He bends and inspects fresh tread marks. He looks up, hi ace straining to understand XT PARK ROAD - NIGH edry's red jeep flies down the park road LOSE ON - Nedry's wheel as he turns it is tires skid sideways, then regain traction. The jeep bolts up  maller access road. He skids to a stop at the top of the hill edry jumps out and looks up. His high beams illuminate a huge electri ence prominently labeled: DANGER! 10,000 Volts wo safety fences separate Nedry from the electric fence. He races t he first one, pulls out a key chain. He tries one key, then another nd another. It  ts. Nedry unlocks the gate, swings open the door edry runs to the second gate. He slips in the mud. He slides to th round, dropping keys in a muddy pool LOSE ON - Nedry's hand frantically fishing for the key chain in th uddy water. Got them! Unlocks the second gate e races to the electric fence. RAIN PELTS him now. Water beads on hi ace. Lightning flashes on the 10,000 volts warning e grabs the gate with his bare hand and swings it open edry heads back to his jeep, his fat body strobed by its high beams e jumps in the jeep and drives through. Behind him, the open gate ove recklessly in the stormy night ACK ON GARAG llie and Harding pull in, in their own gas-powered jeep. Muldoon i aiting for them. Now there's a rifle slung over his shoulder. Hardin umps out of the jeep.
_MULDOON
"Get out, get out! I need this jeep. There's a problem with the tour. Ellie, Hammond'll fill you in."
Ellie is concerned, th  decisive.
_ELLIE
"No! I'm going with you, Muldoon."
They race out XT DOCK - NIGH eadlights blazing in the darkness, Nedry's jeep skids to a stop by th ock where the ANNE B is preparing to leave. The water is very choppy edry jumps out and pulls his incubator to the ground. He begins t rag it through the mud, toward the ship. CAPTAIN FARRELL comes to mee im, along with A COUPLE MEN, who hoist the incubator easily and carr t toward the ship.
_CAPTAIN FARRELL
"Good. Glad to see you. Were you seen?"
_NEDRY
"Nah. I'm back in five minutes, they'll never know I was gone."
(yells after the men with the incubator)
"Careful with that thing! It's worth more than the ship."
(to the Captain)
"When's the copter meeting you?"
_CAPTAIN FARRELL
"It's not. The storm's coast-to-coast,"

nobody could land on the water.
_NEDRY
(totally panicked)
"Shit! What's the backup? I don't like this. Maybe we should do it another time, I don't like it. I just don't like -"
_CAPTAIN FARRELL
"Shhh! I wired Baker, he'll have a man at the dock in Puntaremas. We should be able to make that in time."
_NEDRY
(somewhat relieved)
"Ten hours?"
_CAPTAIN FARRELL
"Yeah, now relax. I got a lot riding on this too, you know. No one's going to mess up now. Baker's not going to mess up. His people won't let him."
_NEDRY
"Ok. Ok. Here."
Nedry pulls an aerosol can out of the baggy crotch of his pants.
_NEDRY
"Look, this is insulating spray."
CLOSE ON - Nedry sprays a big mound of white foam into hi and,
_NEDRY
"In about eight hours, spray down all the eggs with this stuff. It'll keep 'em warm but not too warm. I hope Baker has it together with the dock."
BACK ON CRUISERS, REST AREA  ain drums down on the cruiser. Timmy stares out at the dark. Le tares nervously out the side window. Timmy picks up the night goggle nd snaps them on.
_TIMMY
"Hey, these thing work great. I can see in the dark and I can see far."
He swivels away from the T-Rex paddock and looks out toward the ocean e reaches up and adjusts the knob.
_TIMMY
"Hey! I wonder if that boat's still there? It is. I think they're getting ready to go."

_TIMMY
"Want to look at the boat, Lex?"
Timmy hands her the night goggles. Lex dries her eyes and takes a pee ith the goggles toward the ocean.
_LEX
"Hey, that fat guy's down there. Is he gonna come get us and take us to Grandpa?"
LEX'S POV - the picture streaks but clearly reveals Nedry shouting a he Captain. Men heave the incubator onto the ship.
_LEX
"They have one of those things from the room with all the eggs - you know, where they help the baby eggs grow up."
_TIMMY
"You mean an incubator?"
_GRANT (ON WALKIE)
"What's the commotion?"
_REGIS
"Let me see. Give them to men, sweetheart."
_TIMMY (TO WALKIE)
"Uh, Dr. Grant?"
REGIS GRABS t  walkie talkie and tries to silence Timmy. He knows h ets there too late and reluctantly lets Timmy have it back.
_TIMMY
"We saw that computer guy helping 'em load an incubator onto the ship."
_LEX (TO WALKIE)
"Yeah, he's stealing them, Dr. Grant! He's stealing my Grandpa's eggs!"
_GRANT (ON WALKIE)
"Nedry? With an incubator? Regis??"

_GRANT (TO WALKIE)
"We gotta tell Hammond and Arnold right away. How far is it to the mainland?"
ON TIMMY - He looks at Regis.
_REGIS (TO WALKIE)
"Uh, it's a hundred miles to Puntaremas. About a sixteen hour voyage in this weather."
ON GRANT - He fiddles with the radio in his cruiser. No  sponse still.
_GRANT
"I wouldn't like to see dinosaurs running around Costa Rica."
_GENNARO
"When's the damn power coming on?"
INT/EXT MULDOON'S JEEP, OTHER BACK ROAD uldoon and Ellie drive into the storm. Suddenly, he slams on hi rakes. In front of him, a tree has fallen, completely blocking th oad. Muldoon curses, swerves around, and skids to a stop s Muldoon gets out and assesses the situation, Ellie lodges hersel etween the tree and the jeep. She pushes the tree with her strong leg nd moves it a good five feet. Quickly, Muldoon and Ellie drag the tree s they struggle.
_MULDOON
"Strong legs."
_ELLIE
"Lot of track in college."

_LEX
"I'm hungry. When can we get going?"
_REGIS
"When the electricity comes back on, honey. These cars run on electric cables buried in the road."
IN THE SECOND CAR, Grant tries the radio to no avail. Gennaro smokes rant looks forward toward the first cruiser. He can barely make ou he car in the dark and rain. Occasionally, LIGHTNING reveals all IMMY PULLS GUM out of his pocket. Feels a tiny shake, looks around e puts it in his mouth, chewing quietly. SUDDENLY, the whole ca IBRATES. Regis' sunglasses jump off the dashboard and fall to th loor. The kids look at him.

"Is that bad?"
Regis turns, looks out the side window, away from the T-Rex egis is shaking uncontrollably. Suddenly he throws open his door an olts off into the rain, leaving the door open. No move from the Rex egis races by the second cruiser. Grant stares out at him.

"I hope this is one of them herbivores."
Nedry scrambles the other way, full-tilt. Hop, hop, and the Spitte rops in front of Nedry from the other side. HOOT edry jumps back, lands on his butt. The Spitter zips in from the sid  HOOT edry doubles back, racing through the abandoned equipment, ducking an olling under a cement mixer, spinning past a tree. He splashes dow he embankment, trying to get to his jeep. He uses the winch line t teady himself again the raging current. He finally reaches the jeep wings open the door - and, surging out of the water like  emoni pparition, is the SPITTER! Nedry backs away, directly into the glar f the headlights LOSE ON - the Spitter. It's plume opens, bright orange gills swell ou ike an umbrella around its neck. Something squirts beneath its jaws  big glob SMACKS Nedry on the arm. He brushes it off.
_NEDRY
"Gross."
EXTREME CLOSEUP - the Spitter's head. The jaws puff, the hood flare ut, the neck snaps forward. And - it spits his glob misses Nedry, splashes off the steaming headlight ERY EXTREME CLOSEUP - The Spitter's swollen poison sacs are inflated hey fire his glob hits Nedry in the eyes. He SCREAMS.
_NEDRY
"I'm blind, I'm blind."
He falls against the jeep, rubbing his eyes. The Spitter calmly hops t he embankment and watches the blinded Nedry weave drunkenly in th ater. Nedry grabs onto the jeep and pulls himself along toward th river's door. The Spitter stalks, watching him edry pulls open the jeep door, hrusts his head in, slams it agains he door frame. Now Nedry heaves his whole body into the jeep. Th pitter's long ostrich-like legs stretch and bend in an easy gait as i loses it on Nedry edry sits behind the wheel, unseeing as the Spitter watches patientl urns his blind eyes that way  long beat. The Spitter leaps forward, the CAMERA PULLS BACK WIDER AN IDER. Nedry lets out an ear-splitting SCREAM and the car horn BLARES NT TIMMY'S CRUISE immy lies against a spidered side window, his head pressed against th oor handle. He pushes himself up on one elbow, opens his eyes, an ries to focus. Rain has nearly stopped but a light drizzle hits hi immy tries to straighten up, but he's too dizzy. He stops and hears  REAKING and feels the whole car gently swaying back and forth. With  urther effort, he raises his body so that he's standing with his fee n the window frame and looks out the broken roof IM'S POV - Dense foliage, moving in the wind, hard to see through. A en space and - THE GROUND, FORTY FEET AWAY NT/EXT CRUISER - CONTINUING ACTIO im's cruiser is lying on its side, stuck in the higher branches of  ree on the hillside.
_TIMMY
"Oh shit!"
Timmy pulls his body up carefully, trying to get a better view. H rabs the steering wheel for support and it spins free in his hand RACK! The cruiser slips a few inches down the tree. Timmy grabs th indow frame and freezes. The car sways in the wind RACK! The car slips a quick and rocky two feet.
_TIMMY
"Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit, oh shit!"
Timmy hears something. He raises his head very carefully. Climbing u he tree, pulling himself on a nearby branch, is Dr. Grant.
_GRANT
"Timmy. Are you ok?"
_TIMMY
"Thank God you're here. Where's Lex?"
_GRANT
"Below. She's fine. Let's get you down."
Timmy nods rant peers throu  the broken roof of the cruiser, analyzing Timmy' redicament. He cranes his head back to examine how the cruiser i upported in the tree. Grant turns back to Timmy.
_GRANT
"Try the door you're leaning against. Nice and slow."
Timmy places his weight on the two sides of the door frame and reache etween his legs, trying to open the door handle. Stuck. CRACK! Th ruiser drops another foot rant scrambles down a couple branches until he is even with the cruise gain. He motions for Timmy to hold still rant reaches across to the other car door and tries the outer doo andle. This one opens and very slowly, he pushes open the door. Gran ingerly holds it half-open in mid-air.
_GRANT
"Crawl this way. Slowly."
Carefully testing his weight with each step, Timmy lowers his body down e pushes his legs out the door. They kick in the air and slowly com o rest on a lower branch. He lets himself down. Now he s s on  ranch, a few feet below the cruiser RACK! The cruiser drops. Grant still hangs onto the door but now hi ooting on the branch is gone. His legs hang in space. The cruise angs precariously above Timmy. They're all twenty feet in the air.
_GRANT
"We're going to have to make a jump for it, Timmy. Okay?"
Timmy agrees.
_GRANT
"One, two, three, jump."
Timmy lets go and DROPS. Grant follows. So does the cruiser. It' urtling right at them immy BANGS against the wet tree-trunk and slides down. Branches WHI gainst his face, his hands SCRAPE against the trunk. Grant BOUNCE hem. They scramble down as quick as they can immy pulls his hands along the sap-sticky surface of the tree. CRACK rant is stopped for a terrible instant - doubled over a branch, h lips himself over, dropping further. The cruiser jolts along, just  alf-step behind them immy dives the last six feet and HITS the wet earth ith a THUD! Gran RASHES next to him. Before they can roll out of the way, the cruise eeps coming. Grant and Timmy look up at it RANT'S POV - The cruiser dropping, dropping toward them. And finall tops, just inches away, its dented grill grinning at them, its cracke eadlight glaring il drips down on Grant. He grabs Timmy, who grabs the night goggles he two roll away. That second the cruiser SMASHES to the ground rant brushes himself off painfully, extends a hand to Timmy. Timm lowly reaches up and pulls himself standing.
_TIMMY
"Thanks, Dr. Grant."
_GRANT
"You owe me one."
Grant turns around in a slow, fluid circle, checking out the forest.
_GRANT
"Where'd Lex go?"
They hear a faint WHIMPERING.
_TIMMY
"There's Lex."
He runs. Grant follows NT DRAINPIPE  ex is curled up inside the drainpipe. Her baseball glove is in he outh an he is rocking back and forth, rhythmically banging her hea gainst the back of the pipe. She WHIMPERS N THE HILLSIDE  rant and Timmy arrive at the drainpipe and stare in at Lex.
_GRANT
"Come on out now, Lex."
Lex continues to band her head. Timmy tries again.
_TIMMY
"It's your turn to wear the goggles, Lex."
She shakes her head. He holds up her baseball but she doesn't look.
_TIMMY
"I found your baseball."
_LEX
"You did?"
But she doesn't move. Grant speaks encouragingly.
_GRANT
"Cone on, Lex, it must be cold in there. And tight. Why don't you come out?"
_LEX
"I'm afraid of the "animals"."
_TIMMY
"The "animals" are gone."
_LEX
"Where did it go?"
_TIMMY
"I don't kno"
w but it's not here now.
_LEX
"Are there any grownups out there?"
_GRANT
"I'm a grownup, Lex. Come on out. Gimmie you hand, come on, here you go."
_LEX
"I'm hungry."
_GRANT
"Me, too. We've got to get ourselves back to civilization."
EXT ROADSID egis slowly crawls out from between a couple large boulders. He look round carefully. He peels mud off his face and rubs his neck e touches his cheek LOSE ON Regis' swollen cheek. He rubs it with his finger. Suddenly e swats at his own mouth. He reaches in and pulls out a leech fat wit lood. He hurls it to the ground, spitting. He grabs another off hi rm and rips if off, leaving a bloody streak. He digs in his pants an ulls out another. He SCREAMS s soon as he has done so, he knows he's made a mistake. He look round frantically. Sees the Rex trot down the road toward im.
_REGIS
"Noooooo!"
BACK ON HILLSIDE  rant and the kids crest the hill. Grant puts on the night goggles an djusts the dial and looks toward Regis. The kids can't see that far.
_TIMMY
"What's going on?"
Grant's green POV - Regis and the Rex bounding after him. Regis hugs  ree, unmoving rant whispers to the kids.
_GRANT
"It's Regis and the Rex is after him. But it's okay. Regis knows the Rex can't see him. Evidently, he can only see move- ment. Regis'll be ok if he stays still."
AFTER A LONG MOMENT, the tyrannosaur walks away, disappears into th hadows. Regis waits another long moment and releases his tree RANT'S POV - The tyrannosaur leaps out of the shadows and knocks Regi o the ground. Regis jumps up and backs off. The animal knocks hi ight back down. Regis jumps up again and screams at the beast.
_REGIS

You don't want to hurt Mr. Regis. Go
"away. Ed's your friend. Back off!"
THE REX watches him dance around. It goes toward him. This time it aws are open. Regis SCREAMS and in the middle, the scream cuts off rant lets the goggles fall off his face. They hit the ground with  ETALLIC CLINK. The Rex turns toward Grant and the kids.
_GRANT
"Let's go!"
Grant grabs both the kids' hands and they begin to run ACK ON TOUR REST AREA  rops of water splat on a big fern. Light swims in the little puddle n the sky above, clouds hurry by, intermittently revealing a half bscured moon he torn fence lies in a crumpled, twisted mess. The wheel of a Lan ruiser spins. A little lizard runs in place on it he SOUND of the jeep's engine. It's Muldoon and Ellie HEIR POV - a single cruiser lies on its side in the middle of the road.
_ELLIE
"Oh, My God! Where's the other one?"
Before the cruiser stops, she  mps out. Muldoon shouts a whisper.
_MULDOON
"Ellie!"
Ellie turns in the headlight beams. Muldoon tosses her a flashlight.
_MULDOON
"Wait up."
Muldoon skids to a stop, leaps out of the car. He catches up to Ellie hey share a frightened, apprehensive look. Muldoon gets on his knee nd and touches a muddies area.
_MULDOON
"T-Rex tracks."
Ellie looks out into the forest.
_ELLIE
"Then they must be out there. They must be out there. I know it."
_MULDOON
"Perhaps."
_ELLIE
"No! They're out there."
_MULDOON
"I've seen a lot of animal attacks in the bush. It's not as gory and horrifying to see as you'd think. No pools of blood or exposed bones. There is usually little or no evidence left behind. And if"
victims
"are small, a predator can kill by just shaking the little thing to death, eating it, and leave not so much as a button."
A definite RUSTLING in the brush llie jumps and SCREAMS. Muldoon puts his hand over her mouth an ushes her down. They both squat by the cruiser. SILENCE. Elli wallows. Muldoon slowly gets up. Ellie follows heir flashlights swing back and forth in the night. Twigs crack unde heir feet llie hears the RUSTLE at the edge of the forest. She shines her ligh nto the brush. She catches her breath. Her hand shakes llie flashes her beam right, left, up, down. Jumps. Something i oming at her, rolling at her. She gasps, steps back. It's too late t's Gennaro. His limp body stops at her feet. She covers her mouth uldoon runs to her ennaro is face-down. Muldoon takes his pulse.
_MULDOON
"Thank God. (beat) We have to carry him. First I have to ..."
He stands and removes his acket LOSE ON - Muldoon tears the jacket into long strips e wraps Gennaro's wounds.
_MULDOON
"He's losing a lot of blood. Help me."
Muldoon and Ellie carry Gennaro to the jeep. They lay him on the bac eat. Muldoon jumps in back with him. He keeps wrapping the wounds llie starts the engine, looks back at him.
_ELLIE
"Looks like you've been through this before."
Muldoon looks up.
_MULDOON
"I told you I've seen big game attacks in Africa."
She starts the engine.
_ELLIE
"Right."
Ellie skids out of there NT CONTROL ROOM - NIGH he dark room is lit with two outdoor torches. Light flickering o heir faces, Arnold and Wu stare at the console screen.
_WU
"Why?"
_ARNOLD
"Because Nedry messed with the code. That's why I'm checking it."
 
"WU But that could take weeks. What would be faster? Try keychecks."
Arnold snaps his fingers, grabs Wu,
_ARNOLD
"That's true. Keychecks will give me a record of every button Nedry pushed."
With a rapid series of keys, Arnold initiates "keystrokes". Th omputer displays a short series of commands. Arnold runs his finge own the screen.
_ARNOLD
"Jesus, that's all he did all afternoon? He was just dicking around, maybe waiting to get his nerve up."
Wu points to a line. It reads: WHTE-RBT.OBJ
_WU
"What's that?"
_ARNOLD
"Some sort of object. Let's see if we can trace it."
Arnold types FIND WHTE-RBT.OBJ. Nothing. He tries DEFINE WHTE-RBT.OBJ till nothing. LIST WHTE-RBT.OBJ. The screen fills with data. Eac ine defines another security system that has been shut off: SECURIT ERI TER FENCES OFF/ SECURITY - INTERIOR FENCES OFF/ SECURITY  ABORATORY DOORS OFF/, etc.
_WU
"What's it mean?"
_ARNOLD
"It wasn't a bug. It was a trap door that fat bastard left for himself. When he hit WHTE-RBT. OBJ, it initiates a set of commands that turned the whole goddamn park off. Hammond was right about him."
_WU
"If I did that I'd leave a way to turn it back on. In case I had to. I'm sure Nedry did. You're find it."
Arnold nods grimly NT CAFETERIA - NIGH ammond sits quietly in the deserted cafeteria, calmly spooning ic ream into his mouth. This room is lit by dozens of candles uldoon walks in, stares at Hammond in the semi-darkness.

_MULDOON
"I certainly hope so."
_HAMMOND
"I'm sure we will. After all, I keep telling everyone, this park is made for children."
_MULDOON
"Just so you understand that they're missing, sir."
_HAMMOND
"Missing? Of course I know they're missing. You just said that. Look, Bob, let's not get carried away. We've had a little breakdown from the storm or whatever, and as a result we've had a regrettable, unfortunate accident. And that's all that happened. We're dealing with it. Arnold will get the computers cleaned up, and"
the radio and phone lines
"open. You'll find those kids and my good friend, Dr. Grant. I'm sure they'll want some of this ice cream. It's very good."
INT HAMMOND'S QUARTERS - NIGH ark. Ellie helps Harding get Gennaro comfortable on Hammond's couch lood from Gennaro's injuries stain the rich leather. Gennaro babbles.
_GENNARO
"That Rex didn't even give me his full attention. That's what hurts. I was just an afterthought. I gave him my full attention."
_HARDING
"He's had a lot of morphine."
_GENNARO
(sings)
"Not enough."
_ELLIE
"I need to find Wu. I have to run a few tests in his lab."
_HARDING
"He's probably in the control room, get- ting in the way while Arnold tries to put things together."
As Ellie leaves, Genn o is singing a shanty in his morphine stupor.

"But I'm tired-tired."
_GRANT
"Okay, Lex."
Grant picks her up.
_GRANT
"Oof! You're heavy."
The full moon is blurred by drifting clouds. Their blunted shadows lea he three across an open field toward dark woods beyon  Grant is los s thought, trying to decide where to go.
_GRANT
"I think we're still in his paddock."
Lex's heavy eyes open. Her eyes grow big. She taps Grant's shoulder.
_GRANT
"What?"
_LEX
"Don't you see? Don't you see?"
_GRANT
"What?"
_LEX
"The fence."
_GRANT
(squinting)
"No."
_TIMMY
"Oh I do, right there!"
Lex lets herself slide off Grant and runs into the woods. Timm ollows. Grant follows, squinting. Finally, he sees. A big smile he kids look up at a twelve foot high electric fence. Timmy gulps.
_LEX
"Timmy's scared of heights."
Timmy spins in fury.
_TIMMY
"Shut up."
Lex and Timmy stare at each other. No fighting - now. They relax.
 
GRANT
"Okay with the fence, Timmy?"
Timmy eyes it. Nods hesitantly. They start to climb. Lex climbs easily.
_LEX
(mumbles quietly)
 'Fraid of heights.
Timmy climbs tentatively. A dinosaur ROARS in the distance LOSE ON - Timmy's foot loses its grip immy hangs for a moment, held only by his straining hands ll three stop. Wait. Timmy regains his balance. Slowly, they procee p and over n the other side, Grant looks around. More high trees. Beyond a field.
_GRANT
"A herbivore grazing area. Excellent."
Grant starts to walk toward it. Timmy stops. Lets sits on a tree root.
_TIM
"We gonna walk all night?"
Grant looks at his watch.
_GRANT
"Twelve hours before that ship reaches the mainland."
_TIM
"We need sleep."
True, and Grant's thinking the same thing. He looks ar nd, surveyin he misty forest. He looks straight up into the beautiful, tall tree hat ring the wide-open grassy meadow.
_GRANT
"Up there."
_TIM
"Climb? Again? I can't climb again?"
Grant smiles.
_GRANT
"Sure you can."
Grant checks out and rejects tree after tree. Near the meadow he find t. A good, basic climbing tree XT UPPER BRANCHES OF THE TRE rant helps Lex get comfortable on his lap. Timmy tucks himself i etween Grant's outstretched legs. Grant looks out. Back to kids immy and Lex are already snoring. Lex turns and hugs Grant close t er. She murmurs in her sleep. Grant starts to pat her shoulder whe immy, without waking, reaches to her and strokes her hair.

Battery packs power the microscope u paces the room, regarding his eggs with dismay. Sitting on thei ong tables with no moving wands above them - no thermal sensors.
_WU
"What is taking Arnold so long? This room is too cold. My eggs will be damaged."
Ellie swings the lens to Wu. Not so interested but peers in politely.
_ELLIE
"No sign of those berries. Really interesting. There are indications of a similar virus in every tissue sample. But it's not in the ground. Could I look at some of the discarded embryos?"
Wu reluctantly agrees. He opens a cabinet and brings her samples.
_WU
"I'm sure you'll find your virus ... or a similar one. All animals carry many viruses "
in a dormant condition. It's
"almost impossible to say with certainty which are the same strains."
Ellie begins a test on a sample. She adds a reagent and marks up  lide. As she works:
_ELLIE
"And yet from what Harding tells me, many of you animals have similar symptoms - besides the microvesicles, a lack of hunger, loss of reproductive urges, sores in the mouth and gums."
Wu waves his arms.
_WU
"What the hell does Harding know? He's a veterinarian, not a pathologist."
BACK ON CONTROL ROOM  rnold pushes his chair away from his console and claps his hands a uldoon walks in. Muldoon asks hopefully.

"What is it?"
Arnold points to the screen.

"That's it."
Muldoon comes closer.
_MULDOON
"That's what?"
_ARNOL
D
"I found the command to restore the original code. It resets the linked parameters."
_MULDOON
"The fences and the power?"
_ARNOLD
"Right. And it does something else. It erases the code lines that refer to it. It destroys all evidence it was ever there."
_MULDOON
"Nedry could steal the eggs, get back and reset the whole show. No one would ever miss him."
_ARNOLD
"Watch this."
Arnold types in a command. The screen flickers and changes. Arnold an uldoon look out the window as lights come on through out the park.
_ARNOLD
"Hot damn!"
_MULDOON
"Are the fences back on?"
_ARNOLD
"You bet they are. It will take a few seconds to get up to full power, because we've got fift"
y miles of fence out there,
"and the generator has to feed the capacitors along the way. But in a half a minute we'll be back in business."
Arnold points to the transparent map of the park. On it, bright re ines snake out, moving throughout the park, as electricity surge hrough the fences.
_MULDOON
"Motion sensors?"
_ARNOLD
"Got them too. It will be a few minutes while the computer counts. Then I'll tell you where Grant and the kids are and you can go and get them. But every- thing's working. Half past ten and we've got the whole thing back up and running."
Muldoon picks up a phone, shakes his head.
_MULDOON
"Just hiss."
BACK ON GRANT AND KIDS IN TREE  rant snores. A mosquito buzzes around him. He waves him away an ontinues to sleep n the distance, a tiny BEEPING. Below the towering tree, across th eld, a sensor beeps, it's green light blinks, and the beeping stops N THE HIGH TREE, the branches sway. Grant and the kids sleep on ACK ON CONTROL ROOM  he glowing, glass map. Arnold and Muldoon stare at it.
_MULDOON
"What is taking so damn long? Where are they?"
_ARNOLD
"There's a lot of extraneous movement out there. Branches blowing, birds, back- ground movement. It may take, ah, okay, count's finished."
Muldoon looks at Arnold anxiously. Arnold looks down.
_ARNOLD
"Hmmmm. I don't see them. Maybe they're out of range of a sensor."
_MULDOON
"Shit. I don't know where they are. I wish I could go out there But I haven't got anything to use on the Rex. My rocket launcher's in the jeep Nedry stole. And going out with a big gun in the dark would be suicide"
 NT INCUBATION ROOM, LABORATORY - NIGH rightly lit again. Ellie performs tests with a centrifuge. She look t Wu, who sits across from her in a high stool, stifling a yawn.
_ELLIE
"Why don't you get some sleep, Dr. Wu? I'm just going to run a couple more tests and then I'm going to turn in myself."
Wu doesn't need to be told twice. He climbs off his stool.
_WU
"No point in everyone being exhausted."
He starts to leave. He comes back and speaks consolingly at Ellie.
_WU
"I'm sure Muldoon will find Dr. Grant as soon as there is light."
Ellie appreciates his effort, nods seriously, goes back to work.

"Let's see what's up."
EXT BELOW THE TREE, PARK - MORNIN immy bravely jumps from a very low branch. He smiles and looks a rant, who's already on the ground. Grant looks off in the distance.
_GRANT
"Tim, I think there's a motion sensor across the field and down there."

"Where's Lex?"
ALONE IN THE BUSHES - Lex kneels. She holds a big fruit and calls:

"C'mere boy, c'mere."
She tosses the fruit LOSE ON - the fruit rolling away ex gets up and follows the rolling fruit. She picks it up.

"Dr. Grant, Dr. Grant, look."
Grant turns, looks OFFSCREEN. He's astonished by when he sees IS POV - a row of shrubs, which Lex seems to soar above. As a break i he shrubs, it's clear that she's riding the baby triceratops. Loving it.
_LEX
"Whoa!"
With a whoop, Grant and Timmy chase after Lex on her triceratops ex rides through low brush, ducking down as she goes. Then beneath th all trees as she enters the forest. She crosses a stream on a lo idge. Light showers down through the branches. The water shimmers ex in is paradise ehind her, Grant and Timmy shout for her to stop.

"Go! Go away. Go! Get out of here!"

"Will I ever play with him again?"
Grant looks across the field, abundantly beautiful in the early morning e has to keep them going. He points across the field.

"We gotta get to that motion detector. It's still a ways."

INT HAMMOND'S QUARTERS - DA ammond peeks in the door and sees Gennaro, heavily bandaged, dozing o he couch. Gennaro's eyes flutter and Hammond enters and smiles.
_HAMMOND
"He, Donald. Glad you're awake. I hope you're not going to take this little mishap you had and hold it against my park. It would be terrible if the finishing funds were in any way held up."
Gennaro just grins and shakes his head. He's very high on morphine. H ants to speak but Hammond keeps talking. After each sentence, Gennar nthusiastically agrees with a nod.
_HAMMOND
"You really shouldn't have gotten out of the vehicle. The park is actually quite safe. A disenchanted worker sabotaged some equipment. Arnold, Muldoon, and Wu, all loyal employees, are righting damage"

as we speak.
_GENNARO
"Oh good, 'cause I love the park! It's more than we ever dreamed! Those brachiosaurs are so big! And those Spitters -"
(he spits)
"- incredible! I only have one problem. Aren't we going to have pterodactyls?"
(he frowns, smacks his forehead)
"Oh, they'd fly away!"
Gennaro looks off, watching the imaginary pterodactyls fly away ammond takes out a bag.
_HAMMOND
"Take a look at these, Donald. Have you seen these? These are great."
Hammond dumps things out of the bag. They are souvenirs of the park.
_HAMMOND
"Wind-up toys. Spitter umbrellas."
Gennaro is thrilled.
_HAMMOND
"I got some great t-shirts. Dinosaur bingo, hey ..."
Hammond leans closer.
_HAMMOND
"Wu says he can make a foot high"

triceratops. We'll sell pets as living
"souvenirs. Bio-engineered to eat only food we sell, of course."
Gennaro can't take it. Great idea! He high-fives Hammond repeatedly arding enters and gently taps Hammond on the shoulder.
_HARDING
"You'll have to bear with him, Mr. Hammond. He's doped to infinity and back."
INT INCUBATION ROOM, LABORATORY - DA unlight pours through the windows. Ellie sits with her head in hands he looks around and wanders the lab. Notices a drawer, slides it open -rays. She shuffles through, finds some marked: FREDA llie snaps on a viewing light at her lab station. She studies the X ay. She looks up in surprise. Studies it again he viewing light is snapped off. Ellie looks again. Wu stands there.
_WU
"Who gave you permission -"
Ellie attacks back.
_ELLIE
"I'm here to investigate this park. And there's"
plenty you haven't told me.
_WU
"That's absurd."
_ELLIE
"These bones aren't fully formed."
_WU
"You're qualified to interpret x-rays of living dinosaurs? I doubt it. It took me many months to learn."
_Y
"I'll tell you something else, Freda isn't an adult, just a huge juvenile."
_WU
"You're making a lot of assumptions here."
_ELLIE
"Right. What the hell is going on, Wu?"
They stare at each other in the bright sunlight.
_HAMMOND (OFF)
"Growth hormones."
The two swing around. Hammond stands in the sharp shadows of the room.
_WU
"She didn't have a right to explore my lab."
_HAMMOND
"Let's not argue, Wu, we have a serious problem."
(to llie)
"These animals don't last. There is a regularity, a predictability about when they die. It's always ... very young. We don't know why. Given time, I'm sure Wu will figure it out. It's just ..."
_WU
"Just some adjustment in the code is required."
_HAMMOND
"But there are deadlines. The park opens next summer. And it requires full-grown specimens. So Wu uses growth hormones to achieve the desired size in a short amount of time. But they all keep dying and we don't know how to stop it."
Ellie and Wu stare at Hammond. He steps forward. The light is so ho ehind him that his appearance is like an apparition.
_HAMMOND
"I was going to tell you all this myself, Dr. Sattler, after Gennaro stopped breathing down my neck. That's why I wanted you and Dr. Grant "
here on my
"island - you have to help me keep the dinosaurs alive. Won't you please help me?"
_CUT TO:
IN THE SKY, the sun momentarily burns through the clouds  NT HAMMOND'S QUARTERS - DA llie enters. On the couch, Gennaro snores lightly. In a chair nearb arding sleeps, a roll of gauze grasped in his hands llie walks over to the large model of the park that Hammond revealed he looks at the miniature dinosaurs that sit in different sectors o he park. She picks up the plastic Rex, examines it, drops it back in he brushes by Harding and studies Gennaro's pasty, sleeping face. Ai lows in and out of his dry lips. She examines the gauze wrapped aroun is wounded leg. It seeps with blood NT CONTROL - DA rnold works at his console. Hammond and Wu lean over his shoulder llie bursts in, very agitated. Hammond looks up.
_ELLIE
"Gennaro's losing a lot of blood. "
He
"needs transfusions. We gotta get a rescue helicopter. Arnold, what's with the phones?"
_ARNOLD
"Ah hell. I just can't find it."
He sips his coffee and stares bleary-eyed at the screen.
_ELLIE
"Find what?"
_ARNOLD
"Nedry jammed all the communication lines. He inserted some command, a lockout into the program code. I can't find it, because I gave that restore command and it erased part of the program listings."
_WU
"So? Just reset - shut the system down and you'll clear the memory. Everything will be in the normal wakeup mode."
_ARNOLD
"Shut the system down?"
_WU
"And reset."
_ARNOLD
"I've never done that before. And I'm reluctant to do it. Maybe it's tr"
ue, all
"systems will come on, but maybe they won't."
_ELLIE
"Look, there is a sick man here who needs medical attention or he'll die. Four people are out there, missing in your park. We need search teams. We have to have a phone or radio."
Arnold still hesitates.
_ELLIE
"Well?"
_ARNOLD
"Well, it's just that the safety systems don't function with the computer shut down and -"
Ellie boils over.
_ELLIE
"- turn the goddamn safety systems off! Can't you get it through your head that we have no choice?"
Arnold looks at Hammond, who now stares out into the park. Withou urning, Hammond nods his consent.
_ARNOLD
"Okay."
Arnold gets up and goes to the main panel. He opens the doors an ncovers the metal swing-latches over the safety switches. e pops the ff, one after another.
_ARNOLD
"You asked for it. And you got it."
He throws the master switch he control room goes black. All monitors go black. Arnold, Wu an llie stand in the dark.
_ELLIE
"How long do we have to wait?"
_ARNOLD
"Thirty seconds."
EXT FIELD IN THE PARK  rant and kids walk through a clearing. Lex stops.
_GRANT
"What is it?"
_LEX
"I hear something."
_GRANT
"Come on."
Timmy looks around. The morning is still and peaceful. Branches ar otionless. Only a little bird jumps from one branch to another.
_LEX
"Hear it now?"
_TIMMY
"You're hearing things. Come on, we gotta get back and warn them about the boat."
Lex hesitates but doesn't want to be left behind. She runs bet e rant and Timmy. Then they all hear it ONKING. It comes from the herd of duck bills behind them. First th onking of a single animal, then another animal joins in, then anothe nd another, until the whole herd has taken up the honking cry.
_TIMMY
"What's going on?"
_GRANT
"They're agitated."
The duckbills twist and turn. They hurry out of the water, circling th oung ones to protect them ith a ROAR, the T-Rex bursts from the trees, just a hundred yards awa traight toward the hadrosaurs.
_LEX
"I told you I heard something!"
The earth SHAKES. A low rumble is heard and felt as the hadrosaurs begi o run in a parallel direction to the course of Grant and the kids.
_GRANT
"Outta the way, kids! Run!"
Grant grabs Lex, lifting her bodily off the ground, and carries her lik  football. Timmy runs beside them adrosaurs run alongside of them. Gran ears the crashing of trees e takes a glance over his shoulder RANT'S POV - a flurry of flamingos takes flight and spooks the her nto changing direction. The hadrosaurs swerve and charge right int he path of Grant, Lex and Timmy. They all SCREAM ACK ON CONTROL ROOM  he quiet black room. Hammond stands by the big window. His pensiv resence affects all in the room rnold looks at his illuminated watch.
_ARNOLD
"Memory should be cleared by now."
He pushes the main switch back on. Nothing on.
_ARNOLD
"Damn."
Arnold pushes the switch off and then on again. Still nothing. H lances at Hammond's back. Sweat forms on his brow.
_ELLIE
"What's wrong?"
_ARNOLD
"Oh hell! I have to turn the safety switches back on before I restart the power."
Arnold flips on three safeties, and covers them again with latch covers olding his breath, h urns on the main power switch irst, there is the computer beep. Ellie jumps. Then relaxes. Th ights come on. The screens hum. Hammond's shoulder twitches slightly.
_ARNOLD
"Thank God!"
The room is jubilant. Hugs and cheers. Ellie picks up a phone.
_ELLIE
"Arnold! They're still not working."
_ARNOLD
"No, it sounds dead but after a reset, all system modules have to be brought on line manually."
Arnold quickly goes back to work at his console. Hammond turns.
_WU
(to Hammond)
"Arnold's about to get the phones up."
Arnold pushes the chair back.
_ARNOLD
"Okay, we're up again!"
Ellie grabs the phone back up.
_ELLIE
"No we're not. Phones still dead."
Arnold swings her way.
_ARNOLD
"Can't be -"
 
HAMMOND
"My God, look at this, Arnold."
Hammond points to the transparent map. A tight cluster of dots by th agoon move in a coordinated way. Moving fast, in a kind of swirl.
_ELLIE
"What's happening?"
_ARNOLD
(tonelessly)
"The duckbills."
_WU
"My good God."
_ELLIE
"What?"
_ARNOLD
"It's the Rex ..."
_HAMMOND
"They've stampeded ..."
BACK ON THE HADROSAURS - LOW ANGLE ON THE STAMPEDE  rant and kids run for their lives. Behind them the duckbills charg ith surprising speed. Their enormous bodies charge in a tight group icking up dirt, rocks, whole trees as they thunder along LOSE ON - a charging duckbill as he HONKS, eyes wild with fear  horrible ROAR of the T-Rex sends a duckbill infant squealing an truggling to stay out from underfoot LOSE O  A huge adult foot almost tramples the infant rightened and confused the infant scampers even deeper into th aelstrom.

The stampede is very close behin rant and the kid's faces are covered with sweat and dust nother deafening ROAR of the T-Rex rant leads them toward a rocky outcrop with a stand of big conifers he animals continue to close LOSE ON - the running feet of the stampeding animals. The groun IBRATES every time it is struck by the huge feet RANT AND THE KIDS scramble onto the rocks. They frantically tuck i etween big boulders as the the herd reaches them. Lex shields he usty face with her hands as she wedges deeper between the rocks. Gran ushes her down deeper and looks up from between the rocks RANT'S POV - the immense legs of the first hadrosaur to pass. Anothe lams its big tail against the rocks, leaving a splash of hot blood tampeding legs send clods of dirt f ing in the air. Above, even th irds are running. Disoriented, they fly frantically along RANT AND THE KIDS are enveloped in dust. Just shadows of huge bodie ith giant limbs. BELLOWS of pain as animals wheel and circle  boulder is dislodged and it rolls toward Timmy. He dives out of hi ocky hiding place. The boulder continues on toward Grant and Lex hey dive after Timmy. The group buries itself anew in a group of thic oots tangled amidst smaller rocks. The boulder continues on, SMASHIN he rocky enclave they have just left rant and the kids huddle and watch the last under-bellies oscillat bove them. The stampede goes past.

He targets his prey. A young hadrosaur s the hadrosaur gallops into the shadowy treeline, the Rex lunge iercely. The Rex and its victim are enveloped n dust rant holds Lex close. She watches the terrible cloud with a quie orror. Timmy makes the first move to leave.
_TIMMY
"Let's go. Now!"
The herd's remainder gallops off into the safety of the deep jungle rant, Lex and Timmy run in the opposite direction ACK ON CONTROL ROOM  ammond, Arnold, Wu, and Ellie watch the monitor as the dust slowl lears. Hadrosaurs scatter ow the Rex is calm and quiet. BACK TO CAMERA, he gnaws on something.
_HAMMOND
"No! Oh no! He make a kill. He killed one of my animals! Where's Muldoon?"
_ARNOLD
"I'm sorry, Mr. Hammond."
_HAMMOND
"My animals! My animals!"
Muldoon enters, limping in. Hammond is very upset.
_HAMMOND
"Where have you been? My Rex killed a hadrosaur. You should be out there, doing something."

"I just came to tell you - you're minus one computer expert."
EXT BY THE RIVER, PARK - DA he water rushes a few hundred yards away. Grant and the kids hav inally rested enough. Grant nods to Timmy.
_GRANT
"We'll walk by the river. That leads back to the Visitor's center."
_LEX
"Not me. I'm not walking anymore."
_TIMMY
"Come on Lex, I'll carry you."
_LEX
"Nope. Too scared."
Timmy looks up at Grant. Grant kneels down by Lex. Lex embraces Grant.
_GRANT
"You ready?"
She wipes her tears.
_LEX
"Can we go on the raft? Then we don't have to walk so close to the animals!"
_GRANT
"What raft?"
Lex points to a low concrete maintenance building with bars. It i wenty yards away.
_LEX
"Where I found Freda's baby."
Grant start to stand. He's thinking.
_GRANT
"It's still mid-morning. I bet we have at least ten miles to go. If we take the raft along the river, we can make much faster progress."
_TIMMY
"Let's do it."
INT MAINTENANCE BUILDING  rant stumbles deep in the gloomy recesses of the building. He pushe ast drums of herbicide, tree-pruning equipment, spare tires, coils o yclone fencing, huge fertilizer bags, stacks of ceramic insulators mpty motor-oil cans, work-lights and cables.
_GRANT
"Lex, I don't see any raft."
Timmy looks at Lex. Where is it? Lex doesn't know.
_TIMMY
"Keep going."
Grant keeps pushing through bags of cement, lengths of copper pipe iles of green mesh. Two plastic oars hang on the concrete wall.
_GRANT
"Bullseye!"
Timmy is relie d. Lex smiles.
_LEX
"Told you!"
Grant grabs them. Looks around, still -
_GRANT
"No raft. Where did you see it, Lex?"
_LEX
"Actually, I never really saw one. Just assumed."
_GRANT
"Assumed?"
She nods. Grant and Timmy resume looking N THE REAR OF THE BUILDING - Lex walks below a barred window. Slats o ight fall on her back. She sees a dark closet door ajar. She brushe he handle. It swings opens and two bright orange life preservers fal n her, knocking her to the ground EX SCREAMS, frantically pushing the life preservers off rant's head pops up. Timmy runs to her side. She is wrestlin rrationally with the life preservers. Timmy drops to the ground.
_TIMMY
"Lex! Lex! You're okay, you're okay!"
Lex is overcome with fear. Timmy grabs a preservers and puts it on.
_TIMM
Y
"Look, Lex! Look!"
She looks at him, realizes, and bursts out laughing. Timmy laughs wit er. Grant joins them. He sits on a box and laughs.
_GRANT
"I'm afraid there's no raft."
Grant gets up. He reaches for the hands of the kids. Timmy sees it  he box Grant sat on is labeled: RAFT STORAGE. Timmy smiles. T THE RIVER'S EDGE  rant pulls a cord ith a LOUD HISS, the rubber begins to expand uncontrollably, jerkin nd jumping like a wild marionette. Then, with a whopping HISS-WHAP! i ops fully open on the deck: a large bright yellow rubber raft immy and Lex climb in, wearing the life preservers. Grant gets in an ushes off with his oars he small disturbance causes the cicadas to ROAR. The raft drifts ou nto the lagoon. Grant fixes his oars into the oarlocks rant surveys the river.
_GRANT
"Looks pretty calm."
THUMP. The raft stops moving. They are aground. Lex looks overboard he reaches i bout elbow deep rant stands and puts the oars in the water. He pushes with all hi ight. There is a long scraping sound of the raft against the mu loor. But it moves. And the raft goes into deep enough water  general sigh of relief as they gently float downstream  WIDE AREA OF THE RIVER  rant energetically works the oars LOSE ON - Lex lets her hand trail in the water.
_LEX
"I'll row, Dr. Grant."
_GRANT
"No."
But he's sweating and takes a moment to rest. Lex looks down at he and in the water. It still trails.
_LEX
"Hey, we're still moving."
Grant looks into the water. She's right.
_GRANT
"There's a current."
Grant lays back against the rubber gunwales, closes his eyes. The tw ids look at him.
_LEX
"You can't sleep."
_GRANT
(eyes closed)
"I'm not sl"
eeping... yet.
_LEX
"I'll do it!"
Lex picks up the oars and begins.
_TIMMY
"We gotta warn them about the boat."
Grant opens one eye and looks up at the sun in the sky. He sighs an akes up the oars again. He rows powerfully with the current  BEND IN THE RIVER  urrent picks up speed. The water begins to rush and ROAR.
_TIMMY
"Cool!"
White foam crashes on the raft and sprays the kids. They burst ou aughing. Grant smiles at them, but there is concern in his eyes NOTHER BEND  ow the raft is really racing. The kids hold on tightly as the raft i ocked. White water crashed over, drenching the kids. When Grant take  moment to look, he is soaked by a huge wave he raft tosses right and left. Timmy holds the rubber grips. He' anked to one side. He's knocked to the raft floor. Quickly gets hi rip again. SHOUTS to Grant.
_TIMMY
"Thought"
is looked calm?
_GRANT
"Guess I was wrong."
Grant looks ahead. The river widens. The raft really starts to fly ex, gripping very tightly, looks out. Water sprays her again an gain. Her face is serious.
_LEX
"I can't swim!"
Grant grabs the raft's tie line and pulls it out of its rubber rings e lashes it around Lex and Timmy. Then he ties it around one of th ubber grips.
_GRANT
"Hold on real tight."
They go flying down the river. The ROAR deafens he raft lifts out of the water. And crashes down, rocking every way agged rocks appear. Grant uses his paddle as a club to push off th ocks and the rushing shoreline. The kids duck from sudden overhangin rees rant looks ahead. He blanches IS POV - the surging edge of a tumultuous waterfall hey're almost there. At the huge waterfall, water rushes violently eaving over the magnificent precipice immy tries to tighten  x's vest but is thrown back down . He YELLS:
_TIMMY
"Hold my hand. Hold my hand when we go."
The raft spins in the rushing water. Everyone is thrown around he rope holding the kids to the raft tautens. The oars are wrestled ou f Grant's hands and go flying through the air, spilling over the edge t the last moment, Grant spots a tree branch arching over the cascade ith all his might, he stands and holds his balance long enough. to le is hands smash into the overhanging branch hey stop right at the waterfall's edge rant struggles mightily to hold onto the branch. But the water keep ushing. His strength ebbs.
_TIMMY
"Don't let go!"
Grant's veins pop out in his arms. His hands start to slip off the we ree bark. Lex watches his hands slowly lose their grip he rubber raft jumps and leaps below him. Water pours into the raft ex tries fruitlessly to let it out. Timmy holds down Grant's feet.
 
"TIMMY You can do it!"

Hammond is above, in his throne. He calls down:
_HAMMOND
"Could he drown in that position? That's a very valuable animal."
_MULDOON
"I know it's a valuable animal."
Muldoon takes a step up toward Hammond's throne and the two argu uietly back and forth. In the foreground, Wu calls Arnold over.
_WU
"What's that, John?"
Wu points to the screen behind rnold's head. In the upper right-han orner, it blinks a yellow warning: AUX PWR LOW! Ellie regards it.
_ELLIE
"You running on auxiliary power?"
_ARNOLD
"I'm not."
_WU
"Looks like you are."
_ARNOLD
"Can't be."
_WU
"Print the system status log."
Arnold nods and rapidly strikes keys. In the corner, a printer whirs t ife. Moments later, it spins out a single page. Arnold tears it off llie continues to stare at the screen. It now flashes red: AUX PW AIL! An alarm klaxon BLARES ammond holds his ears against the noise. He stands up he room lights begin to FLASH. They're reflected in Hammond's eyes ammond ROARS above the chaos.
_HAMMOND
"What the hell is going on?"
Onscreen, numbers begin to count backward from ten. Hammond lurches t zero, the lights go off, the monitors ven the computer. Just th larms keep screaming.
_HAMMOND
"You're ruining my ordered, precise park!"
Arnold ignores him, keeps pressing buttons. Hammond rushes towar rnold. Arnold looks over his shoulder in surprise. Hammond SCREAMS.
_HAMMOND
"Fix my park, Arnold! Fix it!"
Arnold crosses his hands in front of his face, blocking Hammond' ttack. Hammond grabs Arnold's wrists and the two twirl to the ground reathing heavily, Hammond clutches his hand to his own chest rnold stands up, brushes off. He puts himself together, looks a ammond. He SHOUTS over the siren:
_ARNOLD
"I know it's hard, I know it's hard, but I'm going to put it all back together for you - I promise. I will"
BACK ON RAFT AT WATERFALL  rant still clings to the overhanging branch, holding the raft fro oppling over the crashing waterfall. Lex and Timmy hold onto his legs he ROAR of th ater diminishes. And the flow subsides from a ragin urrent to a rolling river. And then to a gentle stream. A trickle othing rant slowly relaxes, lets go. So do the children. Around the raft he water level begins to drain. Gradually, Grant and the kids are lef n the raft sitting in just a few puddles of water. Around them arious pumps and other equipment is exposed where it was once covere y rushing white water.
_LEX
"The waterfall stopped."
_TIMMY
"Waterfalls aren't supposed to stop."
_GRANT
"I think they cut the power. Hey -"
He points and the three of them look over the edge where the waterfal nce poured. There's a shimmering rainbow and beyond that, in the mis s the visitor's center.

"Told him, fix my park, fix my park."
Wu brings the printout to Arnold. The printout is a chronologica endering of control room events since the restart. It is clear the ave been running on auxiliary power. Wu yells above the alarm:
_WU
"You shut down as six thirty-four this morning, and when you started back up, it was with auxiliary power."
_ARNOLD
"Jesus. The auxiliary generator fires up first and then that's used to start the main generator because it needs a heavy charge. The main generator has to be manually reset."
_WU
"Outside? In"
the generator building rnold nods. Muldoon points to a line in the printout 6:35:22 WARNING: FENCE STATUS (NB) OPERATIVE - AUX POWER
_MULDOON
"This doesn't mean the fences have been off since six-thirty, does it?"
Arnold grabs the paper, looks at it, slams it down.
_ARNOLD
"Backup power doesn't generate enough amperage to power the electrified fences, so they were automatically kept off. That's also why we had no phones or radio."
_MULDOON
"All of the fences?"
_ARNOLD
"Yes."
_MULDOON
"Including the velociraptor mesh?"
_ARNOLD
(disgusted, exhausted)
"Yes, yes, yes."
In the corner, Hammond lifts his head and Ellie gently helps him to  itting position.
_HAMMOND
"Do you mean those raptor"
s could be loose?
_ARNOLD
"I'm afraid so."
_MULDOON
"No, no way. Last time, it took 'em two days to chew through that mesh. But give"
 'em enough time, they'll get out. We
"better get that power on now."
_HAMMOND
"Regardless, check the pit. Make sure there' five of them there."

In the distance, the alarm still SOUNDS ights FLASH a continued warning hey reach the maintenance building where the generator is housed. It amiliar him has been replaced by its own alarms. The closer the pproach, the louder and brighter these alarms are. Grey steam pour ut of the vents of the building, obscuring everything.
_ARNOLD
"What's that steam coming out of my generator room?"
 
_MULDOON
"Relax, it's just refrigerated air. There's a leaky cooling pipe. I fixed it a couple times before but the original installation was at too sharp an angle."
Arnold accepts this. He is about to enter when Muldoon instructs him.
_MULDOON
"Just go and turn on your generator, then get right back to the control room."
Arnold lights a cigarette and disappears into the steam-shrouded door XT RAPTOR PIT - AFTERNOO uldoon inspects an extremely discouraging sight.

"Okay Wu, I'll have you covered at every moment. But this shell carries quite a punch, so if you're too close, it'll take a piece of you. Ellie's on the headset with you. If another ones come at you, let her know. Then Ellie - you start jumping and yelling. The buggers are easily distracted. They'll come running and let Wu get that power on. Then both of you, get behind this fence as quick as possible."
Wu and Ellie nod seriously and test radio contact. We starts his wa cross the lawn, Muldoon limps behind with his launcher. Ellie stand eady at the open ate u takes slow steps. Muldoon follows. Wu is just five feet away fro he door to the generator building LOSE ON - Wu's tense face HE ATTACK is sudden and fierce. It comes from the brush. The rapto eaps onto Wu in an instant. Wu and the raptor roll on the ground. W truggles for his life. Muldoon can't get a safe shot. He SCREAM:
_MULDOON
"Wu, get away. Give me room to shoot."
Ellie comes running away from the safety of the gate. She jumps up an own, waving her hands, and SCREAMS:
_ELLIE
"Hey you cretaceous dromaeosaur, you can't catch me. Hey, come and get me, you flat-snouted Mongolian beast. Hey!"
The Raptor is distracted by this. He lets Wu go for a moment, shakin im loose from his bloody jaws. Instantly, Wu rolls away. Muldoo ires the rocket launcher. With a SIZZLE, the missile fires. BOOM irect hit! The raptor is blown to tiny pieces uldoon grabs Wu and pulls the inj ed man to safety.
_MULDOON
"You ok?"
In reply Wu gets to his feet, looks where the Raptor was.
_WU
"Now, there's four."
Muldoon helps Wu back inside the fence. He waves for Ellie to come i nd join them llie takes off toward the generator building. She YELLS:
_ELLIE
"I'm going in. Muldoon, cover the door after I go in. Wu, guide me!"
Muldoon yells for her to wait but stops when he realizes that this ma e their best plan llie races like a gazelle across the open lawn. She's very fast an raceful. She ducks into the generator building bove it all, Hammond watches at the small viewing window ACK ON - GRANT AND KIDS AT FENC he three are at the top of the fence now. Grant carefully lifts Le bove the barbed wire and she grabs onto the other side of the fence t egin the climb down. Grant grabs Tim and lifts him next. Tim's tens ace is a river of sweat NT G ERATOR BUILDING  llie finishes the stairs and feels her way along the basement wall er face is lit by a flashing yellow light. She bangs her head on  ipe. She rubs her head.
_ELLIE
"Damn, I banged my head."
_WU (OVER RADIO)
"Oh that's good, that must be the water pipe. You're really close now, there's a cabinet just above your head. Reach up and open it. The handle turns to the left."
Ellie turns the handle. The cabinet opens.
_WU (OVER RADIO)
"It's a large throw-switch. Pull it down, count to three, and push it back up. That's all there is to it."
Ellie throws it down. She counts:
_ELLIE
"One -"

She throws the large switch back ACK ON LEX  he jumps off the fence. Her sneaker comes off, falls to the ground AMERA PUSHES IN ON LEX - it celebrates her narrow escape rant casually leans against the fence to help Lex with her shoe OTHING! STILL NO ELECTRIC FENCES he Visitor's Center is in sight. They all turn to each other. Elated.
_LEX
"We did it!"
_TIM
"We made it!"
Lex jumps up and down. Grant smiles, high-fives Timmy ACK ON ELLIE  he siren and the flashing lights stop. The room lights go on. Elli urns to go back upstairs. Her foot slips, she falls to the ground he has slipped on a pool of blood. She jumps up, recoils t's Arnold. She squelches a SCREAM, covering her own mouth MASH! Ellie SCREAMS as a raptor lunges at her. He jumps dow ro bove the water pipe Ellie banged her head on llie turns and races toward a ventilation shaft. She dives into it he raptor gets there a second late and smashes against the shaft wall llie pushes herself against the shaft wall and, using her legs to pus gainst the wall, begins to climb up he raptor smashes against the shaft again and gets inside. Elli crambles up. The raptor snarls and spits but it is momentarily pinned llie continues her scramble up the shaft. At ground level, she slam er feet hard against a vent, popping it open. Scraping the wall an anging against pipes, she races toward the door XT GENERATOR BUILDING - CONTINUING ACTIO llie runs full-tilt toward the fence surrounding Hammond's quarters u, injured, lies within the safety of the fenced area. Muldoon stand ith his rocket launcher just outside the fence waiting for Ellie llie screams to him as she speeds across the lawn.
_ELLIE
"Raptor!"
The raptor EXPLODES t ough the door of the generator building afte llie uldoon fires at the raptor. Misses. No time to reload he raptor gains on Ellie. Muldoon ducks inside the fence's heavy gate e slides the gate half-shut, waving Ellie on llie dives inside the safety of the fence, losing her headset as sh oes. The gate is almost closed. The raptor lunges uldoon slides shut the heavy gate, bashing the raptor's head with al is might. The raptor shudders, caught in the gate. Stunned, for  econd, it doesn't move llie and Muldoon run to the building. They push open the steel-cla ecurity door and dive inside. Wu limping, chases after them. With  urse, Muldoon pushes the door back open, waves for Wu LLIE AND MULDOON'S POV - Wu runs frantically. The raptor jerks out o he gate, inside of the fence. He races after Wu.
_WU
"Keep it open! I'm coming!"
Wu runs faster. The raptor gains on him. Wu screams, runs spastically u and the raptor are neck-and-nec  equally close to the open door.
_ELLIE
"Come on, Wu! Come on! Run!"
The raptor is inches from Wu. Both are closer and closer to the door.
_ELLIE
"They're coming inside!"
_WU
"Help!"
Wu and the raptor are at the door.
_MULDOON
"No they're not, Ellie."
Muldoon slams the door shut on Wu and the raptor. Wu's screams ar orrific NT HAMMOND'S QUARTERS - CONTINUING ACTIO llie drops to her knees, her chest heaving, pulls her headset off wit  bleeding hand. Muldoon, affected, turns to her.
_MULDOON
"I couldn't compromise everyone's safety."
Ellie nods, catches her breath.
_ELLIE
"Why didn't the power go on?"
_MULDOON
"You just reset the power. Now the computer has to be booted."
Muldoon looks out the tiny barred window of the security d r ULDOON'S POV - There is already almost no sign of Wu. The gate to th erimeter fence slides shut. The raptor looks up. He is trapped withi he perimeter fence of Hammond's quarters AMERA SLOWLY TILTS to the viewing window above. Hammond stares down NT VISITOR'S CENTER  rant and kids walk through the open security doors. All is empty an uiet. They call out but there are no answers.
_LEX
"Where did everybody go?"
Grant thinks.
_GRANT
"Probably your grandfather's quarters. Let's go."
A DISTANT BELLOW. Grant reconsiders.
_GRANT
"Actually, stay here."
He corrals the kids into the half completed enclosure of the Gift Shop.
_LEX
"No, I want to stay with you."
Grant looks around tensely.
_GRANT
"No, keep an eye on things round here for me. I'll be back with the others."
 
"TIMMY What about -"
Grant looks at Timmy.
_GRANT
"I'll radio the ship as soon as I find somebody. (beat) You're in charge now. Don't move from here ... unless you have to, ok?"
Timmy nods. Lex is happy, sinks to the floor.
_LEX
"Goody! I'm gonna rest."
She finds a box of wind-up dinosaur toys. She winds one. Sends i alking to Timmy.
_TIMMY
"Tired! He carried you the whole way."
Grant slips off into the concealing shadows of the skeletal display o he T-rex and raptor in combat. He looks back above his own shoulde nto the menacing jaws of the skeletal raptor. He shouts back.
_GRANT
"Be right back."
INT HAMMOND'S QUARTERS  t's a madhouse in the crowded baronial quarters of Hammond. Gennaro i inging at the top of his-lungs while Harding tries to restrain him cared Workers huddle together, many  e injured. Hammond sits on th loor, in a meditative trance llie and Muldoon stare out the window HEIR POV - The raptor is jumping in the air. With every jump he come loser to leaping onto the roof of their small building uldoon regards his rocket launcher ruefully.
_ELLIE
"Why don't you just nail that bastard?"
_MULDOON
"No more ammo. I requisitioned six charges but the bean-counter -"
(he thrusts a finger at Hammond)
"- cut it down to two."
Ellie looks up to the ceiling. There is a large glass skylight wit risscrossing iron bars casting an ominous shadow in the sun XT THE ANNE B AT SEA - DA he ship continues along smooth sunlit sea. Land is in distant sight NT STATEROOM  he cracked egg is nudged open. The cute scaly head of a six-inch bab aptor nuzzles its way out of the shell. It shakes off a few pieces o linging shell and immediately begins to devour one of th emaining eggs.
_CUT TO:
CLOSE ON - The wind-up dinosaur skitters across the polished floor. I ands against the the wall again and again immy looks down at it and smiles at Lex.
_LEX
"Any candy behind the counter?"
_TIMMY
"Hungry?"
_LEX
"Starved."
Timmy looks behind the counter. He sees boxes of goods. He moves  tack of umbrellas out of his way. Lex gets up and pulls one out.
_TIMMY
"Nothing."
_LEX
"Let's go to the kitchen."
She smiles and pops to her feet. Timmy's not sure.
_TIMMY
"Dr. Grant said -"
_LEX
"- let's go. We'll come right back."
CLOSE ON - Timmy's torn face. He's hungry, too e makes the right decision.
_TIMMY
"Nope. We're waiting here t"
ill Dr. Grant
"gets back. He'll help us get some -"
Interrupted by A SOUND. A rhythmic, horrible BREATHING. Now som ight and rapid STEPS. And a SNIFFING. It's definitely an animal ex backs off in a hurry. She knocks the umbrella over. It skirt cross the floor. It spins and opens by itself. Printed on it is th erocious face of the Spitter, the sides of its bright poisonous gill pinning to a stop he breathing gets closer and closer. The children huddle together in  orner of the gift shop. They SCREAM t's A RAPTOR, lean and ferocious. More like a cyborg than a hunter, i tudies the kids from just outside the gift shop entrance. His eye lick back and forth between the two pieces of meat immy grabs the box of toy dinosaurs. He winds one up and sends it of cross the hall. The raptor glances over at the moving toy. Timm rabs another, whispers as he winds it.
_TIMMY
"Start winding now!"
Lex and Timmy wind toy after toy, send t m across the hall. The rapto eaps, crushing one in its jaws. Others waddle by. The raptor dodge nd darts, grabbing this one, smashing that one he kids go running out into the hall. They race down the Visito enter corridor. Timmy pulls Lex behind him toward the restaurant.
_LEX
"Where are we going?"
_TIM
"The kitchen!"
INT/EXT HAMMOND'S QUARTERS  ith a huge leap, the raptor finally makes it to the roof of Hammond' uarters. He jumps lightly onto the skylight. Glass shatters over th ssembled guests and workers below. Total commotion and SCREAMS he raptor immediately begins to gnaw at the iron bars that block th kylight. Below, they shake off shards of glass and huddle in th orners. Ellie turns to Muldoon.
_ELLIE
"How long?"
_MULDOON
"Well, they seem to be getting faster all the time. I would say - fifteen minutes."
Ellie n ices something out the window. It's Grant approaching th ate. She hammers on the glass rant's hand reaches for the knob he raptor stops gnawing, its ears perked up llie screams and screams rant notices some of Wu's remains inside the gate. He stops and look p. At the window, Ellie waves her arms, warning him not to enter rant stops. He sees Wu's headset on the grass, reaches through th ence, grabs it, puts it on llie jumps up and gets her headset. She barks into it.
_ELLIE
"There's a raptor on the roof of this building. Open that gate and you're a dead man."
Grant stares up at Ellie in the window. He waves. She presses her han o the glass.
_GRANT
"Ellie, I'm go glad -"
_ELLIE
"Shut up and listen. We have about fifteen minutes here. The computer has to be rebooted. That'll turn on the electric fences. Besides the r"
aptor
"stuck in here with us, there are four more ..."
Grant races back to the Visitor's Center as she continues to fill him in NT KITCHEN, VISITOR'S CENTER - CONTINUING ACTIO he kids hurtle through this huge, industrial kitchen. The kitchen is  aze of turns, from the hot lamp pickup area to the rows of stainles teel burners to the chopping blocks to the potwashing area. The kid art and duck from one area to the next, taking shortcuts under tables rawling behind counters, scattering pots and pans behind elentlessly, with a casual speed, the raptor stalks them. It avoid heir obstacles with a casual grace and when it cannot fit through thei hortcuts, it just continues around immy pulls open the large silvered door of the freezer. Lex starts t urry inside. Timmy grabs her.
_TIMMY
"We'll freeze to death in there."
_LEX
"He's going to eat us!"
Timmy reaches into the freezer and grabs a pile f steaks. He tosses on oward the raptor. The raptor gobbles it in one bite. Timmy shoves Le ut of the way and begins to toss the steaks on the floor. One after th ther, he tosses them, in a row, closer and closer to the open freezer he raptor mechanically gobbles the steaks, following their path. H ontinues right into the freezer to grab the last of Tim's bait im leaps and slams the heavy freezer door shut. Lex comes running an hrows her small weight alongside of Timmy's.
_TIMMY
"PUSH!"
The heave and the lock catches on the door. From inside, there is  trangled CRY and the door is slammed repeatedly. The metal panels o he door buckle but they do not break. The door hinges bend and curv ut they do not give he kids collapse in relief on the kitchen floor. In just a moment immy is back on his feet.

"What is it, Timmy?"
_TIMMY
"I just remembered something. Rapto"

He grabs her hand and they run out of the back entrance of the kitchen here's a stairway and they race up NT GIFT SHOP  rant, wearing his headset, calls for the kids and looks around the gif hop with concern. He sniffs the air and examines the crushed windu oys. He sees some animal scales on the floor. He hears a NOISE abov nd begins to run NT UPPER FLOOR HALLWAY, VISITOR'S CENTER  he kids hear this NOISE too and it's closer to them. They bust into  NT AMBER ROOM, LABORATORY  he kids knock over trays of stones as they rush through this room NT EXTRACTION ROOM, LABORATORY  utomated drills whir as Tim and Lex crash through, knocking equipmen o the ground.

This time there is nowhere to go he raptor closes in on the kids. Timmy feebly stands in front of hi ounger sister LOSE ON - The raptor licks its lips, lizard-like t the other end of the room, GRANT ENTERS quickly. He surveys th ituation. Quickly, he grabs an egg off a table. He reaches into on f the chemical cabinets with POISON WARNINGS prominently displayed. H omes out with a syringe and a vial he raptor is almost on the kids. Grant coughs conspicuously. Th aptor whirls, studies Grant. He looks back at the children rant speaks into the headset.
_GRANT (TO RADIO)
"Talk, Ellie, just keep talking."
He tosses the headset on the ground. Ellie's voice crackles out. Th aptor studies it, transfixed rant injects the egg, then gently rolls it on the ground. The rapto orgets the headset. He comes forward and sniffs the egg, then sucks i p, swallowing it whole he raptor turns back to the kids. He takes two steps toward them enses to pounce - and keels over. DEAD he kids race around the dead raptor to Grant. Grant grabs his headse s the three run out of the room. Grant addresses Timmy as they run.

_ELLIE (OVER RADIO)
"Ah, Alan, nobody here knows how to boot the computer. Please hurry, we've only got a couple minutes left."
_GRANT
"Tim, you got to book the system. They reset the power and there are no phones. We gotta turn on the fences and we gotta stop that ship."
_LEX
"Are they going to be ok?"
_GRANT
"If we can get help very soon."
_TIMMY
"Sshh, you guys, I'm thinking."
He studies a grid on a large console. He reaches out and touches a par f the screen. There is a beep and a warning sign - INVALID ARGUMENT LEASE TRY AGAIN ACK ON HAMMOND'S QUARTERS  he raptor has chewed almost all the way through the bars. Panic below n the middle of it all, Ellie is focused, listening on her headset ACK ON CONTROL ROOM  immy tries somethi  else. BEEP. Lex raises a hand. Grant stops her.

"Ok, we're all right here for now."

Thanks.
_GRANT (TO RADIO)
"Don't mention it. It was Timmy."
_ELLIE (ON RADIO)
"But there's still one more raptor. So be careful."
Timmy is pushing menus and submenus on the touchscreen now OMMUNICATIONS - RADIO - VEHICULAR ... He gets the one he wants e indicates the radio-mike to Grant.
_TIM
"I think this is the boat. They called it the Queen Anne or something."
Grant grabs the mike.
_GRANT
"Queen Anne, do you read me? Queen Anne?"
The radio crackles to life.
_RADIO
"This is the Queen Anne B? I copy. What's up?"
_GRANT
"Report your position!"
_RADIO
"Ah, we're just about to dock here in Puntaremas. Who wants to know? Please identify yourself."
Tim punches the screen which displays FARRELL,  EDERICK D. (CAPT. rant reads it and nods. His voice is tough as nails.
_GRANT
"Try this for identification, Captain Farrell. You are in possession of stolen biological materials. If you don't turn that boat around and return to Isla Nublar immediately with your contraband cargo, you will be found in violation of Section 509 of the Uniform Maritime Act, you will be subject to revocation of license, penalties in excess of fifty thousand dollars, and five years in jail. Do you copy?"
SILENCE.
_GRANT
"Do you copy, Captain Farrell?"
_RADIO
"I copy. All ahead stern."
A blinking light on a map indicates that the ship is pulling away fro he harbor. Grant nods to Timmy who terminates the radio contact.
_TIMMY
"What's the Uniform Maritime Code?"
 
GRANT
"Who the hell knows?"
Grant and Timmy start to celebrate again when Lex interrupts.
_LEX
"What good does that do? To have the ship turn around?"
Grant turns to her seriously.
_GRANT
"Well it gives us ten more hours."
(to Timmy)
"Let's see if we can raise the Costa Rican Coast Guard on that thing."
The last raptor smashes into the control room through Hammond's viewin indow. Glass goes flying. Grant and kids go running into the hallway NT ROTUNDA  ith the raptor in hot pursuit, the kids and Grant come flying. Tim an ex jump over the railing, leaping onto the skeletal display. Gran oes for the stairs, jumping down them three at a time he raptor goes after the kids, scrambling over the balcony onto th isplay. The kids scamper down the display, knocking paint cans an ools off the scaffolding as they go. The raptor is just one bea ehind, and his sna ing face is splashed with red paint as he chases he kids burrow into the rib cage of the Rex. They break off floatin ubs and hurl them back at the raptor. The raptor is undeterred losing the gap on the kids he kids are stuck at the end of the rib cage - it's closed off by th keleton and they can't break through. They're imprisoned. The rapto s pushing through the rib cage, bones crackling as it goes rant leaps up the scaffolding, grabs a beam, swings his weight onto it nd slams it into the T-Rex's neck. The neck shatters and the massiv ead of the T-Rex drops free t falls directly onto the last raptor, squashing him flat. Dead.

"And then there were none."

"HAMMOND Dr. Grant, don't abandon this beautiful place. I need a man just like you to help me get my park back on its feet again. And it will be on its feet again."
_GRANT
"We have to leave now."
Hammond stops.
_HAMMOND
"Oh you don't know. There are wonderful plans in the works, sites already purchased for Euro-Jurassic and Jurassic Japan."
Grant is unimpressed. He holds a hand out to Hammond. Hammond tries  ew approach.
_HAMMOND
"Don't you see I've exalted human potential here? You must see it. You must feel it. I called back a life form. Listen, Dr. Grant, don't go. Be a part of this. I'm inviting you to do just that - let the others go, if they want."
_GRANT
"You interrupted natural law. There are regulations,"
rules that nature follows
"that make her knowable."
_HAMMOND
"You mean there are rules that nature follows that create barriers to our knowledge."
_GRANT
"Barriers? Like the seasons? The earth spinning, orbiting the sun? The entire solar system in interlocking motion. Our own beings in biological step with it all. Mr. Hammond, you've disrupted the pattern and look what it's done!"
_HAMMOND
"I know what it's done. I've made triceratops and gallimimus and a T-Rex. I've got a batch of iguanadons being born on Tuesday. What do you say to that?"
_GRANT
"Don't count on it. Now get in."
Grant jumps in the copter, holds out a hand to Hammond.
_GRANT
"You created mutant forms that you further mutated to create amus"
ement attractions.
"You made biological puppets with heartbeats and an early death sentence."
_HAMMOND
"I created genetic miracles!"
_GRANT
"You created a park to generate a profit- making merchandising operation."
_HAMMOND
"The merchandise is just a by-product. Souvenirs for people to reflect on the wonder. You fainted when you saw the brachiosaur. Alan, look, let's not argue. The problem is that my employees were not up to par with my dream. They failed me. The park, I promise you, is safe. It really is."
Grant grabs Hammond's arm, starts to tug.
_GRANT
"You park is doomed. Now come with me."
 
_HAMMOND
"It is not! It's blooming! In the throes of labor! You are one more more negative voice in a "
universe of negativity.
"You'll amount to nothing. You'll be a bone-brusher all your life. I pity you."
Hammond pulls his arm away and strides away from the helicopter just a he ROTORS START UP. Hammond's suit whips in the wind. Grant calls t im, reaching out his arm.

"Come back, Mr. Hammond! It's over!"

"They're so beautiful. They're condemned, aren't they? Even those embryo fragments had the same viral contamination."
_GRANT
"I have a theory."
Ellie looks up in surprise. She give him a big smile.
_ELLIE
"You have a theory?"
Grant smiles back at her.
_GRANT

I think that they could never completely 
"isolate the dinosaur DNA. There was always some microscopic mosquito contamination. But at the molecular level, that was enough. Every dinosaur received the same genetic massage, the encoding that every mosquito gets to terminate life after a season."
_ELLIE
"So the very process itself was flawed."
