While AUNT PETUNIA puts the finishing touches to  UDDING of WHIPPED CREAM and SUGARED VIOLETS, UNCL ERNON struggles with DUDLEY'S BOW TIE, all the whil lowering at Harry.
_UNCLE VERNON
"I warned you. If you can't control that bloody bird, it'll have to go."
_HARRY
"She's bored. If I could just let her out for an hour or two --"
_UNCLE VERNON
"And have you sending secret messages to your freaky little friends? No, sir."
(CONTINUED HE CHAMBER OF SECRETS - Rev. 1/28/02

4 CONTINUED:

_HARRY
"But I haven't gotten any messages. From any of my friends. Not one. All summer."
_DUDLEY
"Who'd want to be friends with you?"
_UNCLE VERNON
"I should think you'd be more grateful. We raise you since you were a baby, give you food off our table, even let you have Dudley's second bedroom... purely out of the goodness of our hearts."
_DUDLEY
"I thought he got the second bedroom because Mum was afraid he'd turn us into dung beetles if you put him back in the cupboard under the stairs."
AUNT PETUNIA stops cold, exchanges a dark look with Uncl ernon, then sees Dudley extending a finger for th udding.
_AUNT PETUNIA
"Not yet, popkin. That's for when the Masons arrive."
_UNCLE VERNON
"Which should be any moment. Now. Let's run through our schedule one more time. Petunia, when the Masons get here, you will be --"
_AUNT PETUNIA
"In the lounge, waiting to welcome them graciously to our home."

_HARRY
"I'll be in my bedroom, making no noise and pretending I don't exist."
_UNCLE VERNON
"Too right you will. With any luck, this could well be the day I make the biggest deal of my career."
DOORBELL RINGS. Instantly, Uncle Vernon shoves Harry ou f the kitchen and into the hallway.
_UNCLE VERNON
"Upstairs! Hurry!"

6 INT. HARRY'S BEDROOM - DAY

Harry enters, turns, and stops dead: a tiny CREATUR ith bat-like ears and bulging green eyes is jumping o is bed as if it were a trampoline. This is DOBBY.

"Harry Potter! Such an honor it is!"
(CONTINUED)

_HARRY
"What... Who are you?"
_DOBBY
"Dobby, sir. Dobby the house elf."
_HARRY
"I see. Not to be rude or anything, but this isn't a great time for me to have a house-elf in my bedroom."
_DOBBY
"Oh, yes, sir, Dobby understands. It's just that, Dobby has come to tell you... it is difficult, sir... Dobby wonders where to begin."
_HARRY
"Why don't you sit down?"
_DOBBY
"S-s-sit down?"
Suddenly Dobby BURSTS INTO TEARS. LOUD TEARS. Harr anics.
_HARRY
"Shhhh! I'm sorry. I didn't mean to offend you or anything --"
_DOBBY
"Offend Dobby! Dobby has heard of your greatness, sir, but never has he been asked to sit down by a wizard, like an equal..."
_HARRY
"You can't have met many decent wizards then."
Dobby shakes his head, then without warning, LEAPS off th ed and starts to BANG HIS HEAD FURIOUSLY ON THE FLOOR.
_DOBBY
"Bad Dobby! Bad Dobby!"

_DUDLEY
"Cat? What cat?"
_UNCLE VERNON
"Our cat, tiger."

8 INT. HARRY'S BEDROOM - DAY

Dobby gets back to his feet, wobbling, eyes spinnin izzily. Harry regards him with a mixture of concern.. nd wariness.
_HARRY
"Are you... all right?"
_DOBBY
"Dobby had to punish himself, sir. Dobby almost spoke ill of his family, sir."
_HARRY
"Your... family?"
_DOBBY
"The wizard family Dobby serves, sir. Dobby is bound to serve one family forever. If they ever knew Dobby was here..."
Dobby shudders in fear, then looks up, WHISPERS urgently.
_DOBBY
"But Dobby had to come. Dobby has to protect Harry Potter. To warn him."
(in a fierce whisper)
"Harry Potter must not go back to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry this year."
_HARRY
"Not go back? But... I have to."
_DOBBY
"This is a plot. A plot to make most terrible things happen. If Harry Potter goes back to school he will be in great danger."
(CONTINUED)

_HARRY
"What terrible things? Who's plotting them?"
Dobby makes a funny CHOKING and GAGGING noise.

Uncle Vernon is in the midst of telling a joke.
_UNCLE VERNON
"They arrive at the ninth hole and --"
DOBBY'S YELPS INTERRUPT, ringing out from above.

_UNCLE VERNON
"Not to worry. I'll sort it out."

Harry wrestles the lamp away from Dobby.
_HARRY
"Stop! Stop!"
FOOTSTEPS THUNDER on the landing. Quickly, Harry grab obby by the pillowcase and pitches him into th ardrobe... just as the door FLINGS OPEN.
_UNCLE VERNON
"What the devil are you doing up here! You've just ruined the punch line of my Japanese golfer joke. One more sound and you'll wish you'd never been born, boy!"
He stomps flat-footed from the room and SLAMS THE DOOR arry lets Dobby out of the wardrobe CONTINUED)


10 CONTINUED: 10

_HARRY
"See why I've got to go back? I don't belong here. I belong in your world -- at Hogwarts. It's the only place I've got... friends."
_DOBBY
"Friends who don't even write to Harry Potter?"
_HARRY
"Well, I expect they've been -- hang on, how do you know my friends haven't been writing me?"
Guiltily, Dobby takes out a STACK of LETTERS.
_DOBBY
"Harry Potter mustn't be angry with Dobby -- Dobby hoped if Harry Potter thought his friends had forgotten him... Harry Potter might not want to go back to school, sir..."
_HARRY
"Give me those. Now."
Dobby frowns sadly, then DASHES out the door anicking...

"Forgive me, Mr. Potter. But your scar is legend. As, of course, is the wizard who gave it to you."
_HARRY
"He was a murderer."
_LUCIUS MALFOY
"Yes, a pity about your parents. Curious that you yourself should escape with a mere flesh wound. Curious, too, that you speak of him in the past. Surely, you don't think He-Who-Must-Not-Be- Named is gone forever."

"His name is Voldemort."
Those within earshot gasp as Harry utters the word.

CAMERA PANS the walls of Lockhart's office, lined wit RAMED PHOTOGRAPHS of... Gilderoy Lockhart. Harry an ockhart work by candlelight at an ornate desk. Bleary yed, Harry addresses envelopes, while a cheery Lockhar uts his signature to the stack of GLOSSY PHOTOS bearin is image.
_GILDEROY LOCKHART
"Harry, Harry, Harry... Can you possibly imagine a better way to serve detention than by helping me answer my fan mail?"
Harry forces a smile.
_GILDEROY LOCKHART
"Fame's a fickle friend, Harry. Celebrity is as celebrity does. Remember that."
Harry nods, glancing gloomily at the towering stack o nvelopes that remain. Dipping his quill, he starts t rite, when... a CHILLY VOICE fills the room.

_Voice?
_HARRY
_That... voice. Didn't you hear
 it?
_GILDEROY LOCKHART
_What are you talking about, Harry?
_I think we're getting a bit
 drowsy. Great Scott -- and no
 wonder -- look at the time! We've
 been here nearly four hours!
_Dinner's nearly done! If you
 hurry you might make pudding.
_Spooky how the time flies when
 one's having fun!
_HARRY
_Spooky.

Harry passes quickly through the lengthening shadows o he empty corridor, when...

Harry stops cold, looking around for the source of th oice.

Harry dashes madly, taking the steps three at a time. H akes the landing, rushes through the archway, and...

59 INT. SECOND FLOOR CORRIDOR - SECOND FLOOR - NIGHT

... sleds to a stop, listening: Nothing. Slowly, h eers down. WATER is oozing over the stone floor urrounding his shoes. His own REFLECTION appears and ehind it, undulating like a dream... WORDS. Ron an ermione come huffing up CONTINUED HE CHAMBER OF SECRETS - Rev. 1/28/02

59 CONTINUED:

_RON
"Harry, what are you doing?"
He points. SHIMMERING on the wall are the words he sa eflected in water.
"THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS HAS BEEN OPENED"
_ENEMIES OF THE HEIR... BEWARE.
_HERMIONE
 'The Chamber of Secrets has been
"opened...?'"
_RON
"What's that? Hanging underneath?"
_HARRY
"That's Filch's cat. Mrs. Norris."
The cat hangs stiffly by her tail from a torch bracket yes open and blank. Harry's eyes shift to the adjacen INDOW: near the topmost pane, SPIDERS scuttle up  ilvery thread, fight to get through a crack in th lass.
_HERMIONE
"Look at that. Have you ever seen spiders act like that? Ron...?"
_RON
(backing away)
"I... don't... like... spiders."
Suddenly, the stairwell is alive with VOICES and, second ater, dozens of students stream forth, CHATTERING.. hen they stop, seeing the wall and, standing before it arry, Ron and Hermione. A thudding SILENCE falls. The raco pushes forward, eyes the wall, and grins nastily.
_DRACO
"Enemies of the heir, beware! You'll be next, Mudbloods!"
Draco's eyes find Hermione, just as Filch appears.
_FILCH
"What's going on here? Go on now! Make way..."

"Mrs. Norris!"

"Argus!"
Dumbledore marches forward, trailed by a phalanx o eachers. Seeing the wall, Dumbledore's face darkens.
_DUMBLEDORE
"Everyone will proceed to their dormitories immediately."
(to Harry, Ron,
_Hermione)
"Everyone except you three."
As the corridor empties, Dumbledore steps to the wal nd, with extreme gentleness, removes Mrs. Norris.
_GILDEROY LOCKHART
"It was definitely a curse that killed her -- probably the Transmogrifian Torture. Encountered it myself once, in Ouagadougou. The full story's in my autobiography..."
_DUMBLEDORE
"She's not dead, Argus. She's been Petrified."
_GILDEROY LOCKHART
"Precisely! So unlucky I wasn't there. I know the very countercurse that could have spared her..."
_DUMBLEDORE
"But how she's been Petrified... I cannot say."
_FILCH
(pointing at Harry)
"Ask him! It's him that's done it. You saw what he wrote on the wall! Besides, he knows I'm -- I'm a Squib."
_HARRY
"It's not true, sir! I swear! I never touched Mrs. Norris -- And I don't even know what a Squib is."

"Perhaps Potter and his friends were simply in the wrong place at the wrong time..."
_Could Snape be defending
Harry and the others blink hem?
_SNAPE
"However, the circumstances are suspicious. I, for one, don't recall seeing Potter at dinner."
_GILDEROY LOCKHART
"I'm afraid that's my doing, Severus. You see, Harry was helping me answer my fan mail..."
As Snape's lip curls in disgust, Hermione leaps in.
_HERMIONE
"That's why Ron and I went looking for him, Professor. We'd just found him when Harry said..."
_SNAPE
(raising an eyebrow)
"Yes, Miss Granger?"
_HARRY
"When I said I wasn't hungry. We were heading back to the Common Room and... found Mrs. Norris."
Snape eyes Harry coldly, knowing he's lying. Harry look way... and finds Dumbledore studying him as well.

_We will be able to cure her,
_Argus. As I understand it, Madam
_Sprout has a very healthy growth
 of Mandrakes. When they have
 matured, a potion will be made
 which will revive Mrs. Norris. In
 the meantime, I advise caution.
_To all.

60A INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT (A BIT LATER) 60A

Harry, Ron and Hermione walk down the corridor.
_RON
_A Squib's someone who's born into
 a wizarding family but hasn't got
 any powers of their own. It's why
_Filch is trying to learn magic
 from a Kwikspell course. It's
 also why he hates students so
 much. He's bitter.
Hermione, who's only been half-listening -- as if tryin o unravel something in her mind -- speaks then.
_HERMIONE
_Harry. This voice. You said you
 heard it first in Lockhart's
 office?
_HARRY
_Yes.
_HERMIONE
_And did he hear it?
_HARRY
_He said he didn't.
_RON
_Maybe he was lying.
_HERMIONE
_I hardly think someone with
_Gilderoy Lockhart's credentials
 would lie to one of his students,
_Ronald. Besides, if you recall,
 we didn't hear anything either.

_HARRY
_You do believe me, don't you?
_HERMIONE
 'Course we do. It's just... it's
 a bit weird, isn't it? You hear
 this voice and then... Mrs. Norris
 turns up Petrified.
_HARRY
_I can't explain it -- it was...
 scary.
(frowning)
_D'you think I should've told them
 -- Dumbledore and the others, I mean.
_RON
_Are you mad!
_HERMIONE
_No, Harry. Even in the wizarding
 world, hearing voices isn't a good
 sign.

62 INT. PROFESSOR McGONAGALL'S CLASSROOM - MORNING

McGonagall stands before the class. Resting on the des n front of each student, is a different animal.
_PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
_Today, we will be turning animals
 into water goblets.
She taps the bird in front of her, three times, with the ti f her wand. It transfigures into a beautiful crystal wate oblet.
_PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
_Now, who would like to go first...
_Mr. Weasley?
Ron nods. He TAPS his rat, Scabbers, who turns into  oblet with a tail.
_PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
_You must replace that wand, Mr.
_Weasley.
Ron nods sheepishly, looks at his broken wand CONTINUED HE CHAMBER OF SECRETS - Rev. 3/1/02

62 CONTINUED: (A1)

McGonagall sees Hermione's raised hand. Her untouche nimal.
_PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
"Yes, Miss Granger?"
_HERMIONE
"Professor, I was wondering if you could tell us about the Chamber of Secrets?"
A HUSH falls over the class.
_PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
"My subject is Transfiguration, Miss Granger."
_HERMIONE
"Yes, Professor. But there seems to be very little written about the Chamber of Secrets. For those of us with a personal interest in the subject, that is... disturbing."
Malfoy regards Hermione with chilly amusement cGonagall considers Hermione's question for a lon oment, then nods.
_PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
"Very well. You all know, of course, that Hogwarts was founded over a thousand years ago by the four greatest witches and wizards of the age:"
(MORE CONTINUED)


62 CONTINUED:

_PROFESSOR McGONAGALL (CONT'D)
"Godric Gryffindor, Helga Hufflepuff, Rowena Ravenclaw, and Salazar Slytherin. Three of the founders co-existed quite harmoniously. One did not."
_RON
"Three glasses who?"
_PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
"Salazar Slytherin wished to be more selective about the students admitted to Hogwarts. He believed that magical learning should be kept within all-magic families. In other words, purebloods. Unable to sway the others, he decided to leave the school."
(a beat)
"According to legend, Slytherin had built a hidden chamber in this castle, known as the Chamber of Secrets. Shortly before departing, he sealed it until that time when his own true heir returned to the school. The heir alone would be able to open the Chamber of Secrets and unleash the horror within, and by so doing, purge the school of all those who, in Slytherin's view, were unworthy to study magic."
_HERMIONE
"Muggle-borns."
_PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
"Yes. Naturally, the school has been searched many times for such a chamber. It has never been found."
_HERMIONE
"Professor, what exactly does legend tell us lies within the Chamber?"
_PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
"The Chamber is said to be home to something which the heir of Slytherin alone can control. It is said to be home... to a monster."
Ron's eyes shift. Malfoy sits calmly, smiling t imself HE CHAMBER OF SECRETS - Rev. 1/28/02

63 INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

Harry, Hermione, and Ron thread their way through th eeming corridor. Up ahead, Malfoy walks with Crabbe an oyle.
_RON
"D'you think it's true? D'you think there really is a Chamber of Secrets?"
_HERMIONE
"Yes. Couldn't you tell: McGonagall's worried. All the teachers are."
_HARRY
"But if there really is a Chamber of Secrets, and it's really been opened, that means..."
_HERMIONE
"The Heir of Slytherin has returned to Hogwarts. The question is, who is it?"
_RON
(in mock puzzlement)
"Let's think. Who do we know who thinks Muggle-borns are scum."
_HERMIONE
(eyeing Malfoy ahead)
"If you're talking about him --"
_RON
"Of course! You heard him:"
 'You'll be next, Mudbloods'!
_HERMIONE
"I heard him. But Malfoy? The Heir of Slytherin?"
_HARRY
"Maybe Ron's right, Hermione. I mean, look at his family. The whole lot of them have been in Slytherin for centuries."
_RON
"Crabbe and Goyle must know. Maybe we could trick them into telling..."
(CONTINUED HE CHAMBER OF SECRETS - Rev. 1/28/02

63 CONTINUED:

_HERMIONE
"No. Even they aren't that thick. But there might be another way. Mind you, it would be difficult. Not to mention we'd be breaking about fifty school rules. And it would be dangerous. Very dangerous."
_RON
"When do we start?"

64 INT. LIBRARY - NIGHT

In a dark nook, Harry, Ron and Hermione huddle round  ook entitled Moste Potente Potions. The spotted page re littered with DISTURBING ILLUSTRATIONS.
_HERMIONE
"Here it is: 'The Polyjuice Potion. Properly brewed, the Polyjuice Potion allows the drinker to transform himself temporarily into the physical form of another...'"
_RON
"You mean, Harry and I drink some of this stuff and we turn into Crabbe and Goyle?"
_HERMIONE
"Yes."
_RON
"Wicked! Malfoy'll tell us anything!"
_HERMIONE
"Exactly. But it's tricky. I've never seen a more complicated potion. Lacewing flies, leeches, fluxweed. And, of course, we'll need a bit of whoever we want to change into too."
_RON
"Hang on now. I'm drinking nothing with Crabbe's toenails in it."
(CONTINUED)


64 CONTINUED:

_HARRY
"How long will it take to make?"
_HERMIONE
"A month."
_HARRY
"A month? But if Malfoy is the heir of Slytherin... he could attack half the Muggle-borns in the school by then."
_HERMIONE
"You didn't have to tell me that."

65 EXT. QUIDDITCH STADIUM - DAY

We join the Quidditch match in mid-game. The CROW OARS, watching as Slytherin Chasers, bent low over thei ew brooms, jet past the overmatched Gryffindors.

"Gallopin' Gorgons! Slytherin's flyin' like they got dragon fire in their brooms..."
Ron fumes, looking as though he takes Slytherin' ominance personally. Taking Hagrid's GIANT BINOCULARS e trains them on the FACULTY BOX -- where Lucius Malfo its next to Snape arry circles high above the pitch, searching for th olden Snitch. Suddenly, Malfoy streaks by overhead.

"Blimey, Harry's got 'imself a Rogue Bludger!"

_HAGRID
"Look fer yerself! It's bin' tampered with!"
Harry executes a series of zigs, zags, loops and rolls rying to shake the Bludger, but the Bludger i elentless on instinctively draws his wand, begins to point i oward Harry and the Bludger, when... Hermione's han ntercedes. She glances knowingly at his fractured wand.
_HERMIONE
"You're joking, right? Besides, even with a proper wand, it's too risky. You could hit Harry."
As Harry frantically dips and dives, Malfoy cruises by.

Calmly, Hermione strides forth, points her wand.
_HERMIONE
"Finite Incantatem!"
The Bludger hangs briefly in the air. Slowly cease pinning. Drops heavily to the pitch. Harry exhales elieved, only to recall the searing pain in his arm. A ONCERNED FACES swim above him, one particular fac ushes through the others:

_GILDEROY LOCKHART
"Ah. Yes. Well, that can sometimes happen. The point is, the bones are no longer broken."
_HAGRID
"Brok'n? He doesn't 'ave any bones at all!"

_HERMIONE
"You will be able to, won't you?"
_MADAM POMFREY
"I'll be able to, certainly, but it will be painful. You're in for a rough night, Potter. Regrowing bones is nasty business."

"Not kill you, sir, never kill you! Dobby remembers how it was before Harry Potter triumphed over He Who Must Not Be Named. We house elves were treated like vermin, sir. Of course, Dobby is still treated like vermin..."
Dobby HONKS his nose on the filthy pillowcase he wears.
_HARRY
"Why do you wear that thing, Dobby?"
_DOBBY
"This, sir? 'Tis a mark of the house elf's enslavement. Dobby can only be freed if his master presents him with clothes. The family is careful not to pass Dobby so much as a sock, sir, for then he would be free to leave their house forever."

_HERMIONE
"Again? You mean, the Chamber of Secrets has been opened before?"
_RON
"Of course! Don't you see? Lucius Malfoy must've opened it when he was at school here, and now he's told Draco how to do it."
_HERMIONE
"Maybe. We'll have to wait for the Polyjuice Potion to know for sure."
_RON
"Enlighten me. Why are we brewing this potion in broad daylight, in the middle of a girls' lavatory? Don't you think we'll get caught?"

"Never. No one over comes in here."

There is a LOUD, PIERCING SCREECH, and the GHOST OF  OUNG GIRL COMES RACING OUT OF THE WALL. FACE TO FAC ith Ron.

"Ah, thank you, Miss Granger. Yes, an excellent idea to show them that, Professor Snape, but if you don't mind my saying so, it was very obvious what you were about to do. If I had wanted to stop you it would have been only too easy..."

"Allow me!"
Lockhart flicks his wand. BANG! The SNAKE flies int he air, HISSES in rage, and slithers straight toward ustin Finch-Fletchley. As students SCREAM, Harry - ddly calm -- approaches the snake. It rises, fang xposed, poised to strike Justin.
_HARRY
(in Parseltongue)
"Leave him!"
The snake looks into Harry's eyes, then turns for Justin.
_HARRY
(in Parseltongue)
"LEAVE HIM!"
The snake hovers a moment more, then -- miraculously - lumps to the floor. Harry blinks, as if coming out of  rance, grins curiously at the snake, and offers his han o Justin.
_JUSTIN-FINCH-FLETCHLEY
"What are you playing at?"
Terrified, Justin backs away. Confused, Harry eyes th aces around him. Malfoy looks shocked. Seamus an eville's eyes glitter with fear. Ginny bolts the room nape waves his wand and the snake VANISHES in PUFF O LACK SMOKE, then regards Harry with a look that is bot hrewd and calculating.

_HARRY
"I spoke a different language? But I didn't realize -- how can I speak a language without knowing I can?"
_HERMIONE
"I don't know, Harry. But it sounded like you were egging the snake on or something. It was... creepy."
As Gryffindors stream into the room, they eye Harr arily. Even Seamus, Neville, and Dean Thomas walk b ithout a word.
_HERMIONE
"Harry, listen out me. There's a reason the symbol of Slytherin house is a serpent. Salazar Slytherin was a Parselmouth. He could talk to snakes too."

_HANNAH
"And you definitely think Potter's the Heir of Slytherin?"
_ERNIE
"Hannah, he's a Parselmouth. Everyone knows that's the mark of a dark wizard. Have you ever heard of a decent one who could talk to snakes? They called Slytherin himself Serpent-tongue."
(whispering darkly)
"Remember what was written on the wall: Enemies of the Heir Beware. Potter had some sort of run-in with Filch. Next thing we know, Filch's cat's attacked. That first-year Creevey's been annoying Potter. Then Creevey's attacked."
_HANNAH
"He always seems so nice, though. And, after all, he is the one who made You Know Who disappear."
_ERNIE
"That's probably why You Know Who wanted to kill him in the first place. Didn't want another Dark Lord competing with him."

"You're wrong!"
The hat sits motionless. Silent. Hearing a GAGGIN OUND, Harry wheels, finds an OLD, DECREPIT BIRD (FAWKES itting on a GOLDEN PERCH. It wobbles, then... BURST NTO FLAMES. As Dumbledore enters, Harry looks horror truck.

Harry looks to the floor. The ASHES swirl. A bab awkes pokes out his wrinkled head, blinking through th ust.

Grinning, Malfoy glances over the paper at Harry and Ron.

_Dreadful thing, Dumbledore, but
 the governors feel it's time for
 you to step aside. This is an

 afraid we feel you're losing your
 touch. What with all these
 attacks, there'll be no Muggle-

123 INT. HOSPITAL WING - DAY

Madam Pomfrey bars the door, frowns at Harry and Ron.
_MADAM POMFREY
_There's no point in talking to a
 petrified person. She won't hear
 a word you're saying.
Ron shifts uncomfortably.
_RON
_We know that, Madam Pomfrey. It's
 just, well, you see, we thought,
 maybe, we could... be with her for
 a bit. She's our... friend, you
 see, and... even if she can't hear
 us... I mean, it can't hurt, can
 it?
A glint of sympathy flickers in Pomfrey's eyes.
_MADAM POMFREY
_Very well then. But be quick
 about it.
As she exits, the boys step to her bed. Absently, Ro icks up the circular mirror that lies on the nightstand yes Lockhart's Get Well card.
_RON
_You don't think Lockhart could be
 the heir of Slytherin, do you?
(off Harry's look)
_Right. Forget I said it.

Harry studies Hermione's face.
_HARRY
_Wish you were here, Hermione. We
 need you. Now more than ever...
Just then, the mirror in Ron's hand CATCHES the LAT FTERNOON SUNLIGHT and casts a jagged FLAME acros ermione's hand. Harry watches the light dance over he ingers... then looks closer. Sees the paper clutche here.

124 INT. CORRIDOR - DUSK (LATER)

Harry and Ron duck into an alcove, take out the CRINKLE aper, which, we see now, is TORN from a library book.
_HARRY
 'Of the many fearsome beasts that
 roam our land, none is more deadly
 than the Basilisk. Capable of
 living for hundreds of years,
 instant death awaits any who meet
 this giant serpent's eye. Spiders
 flee before it and only the
 crowing of the rooster can kill
 it.'
(looking up)
_Ron! This is it! The monster in
 the Chamber of Secrets is a
_Basilisk. That's why I can hear
 it speak. It's a snake.
_RON
_But it kills by looking people in
 the eye. Why is it no one's dead?
Harry frowns, contemplating this, then catches he an on's REFLECTION in the window opposite. He mutter OFTLY:
_HARRY
_Because no one did look it in the
 eye. Not directly at least...
(in a rush)
_Colin saw it through his camera.
_Justin -- Justin must've seen the
_Basilisk through Nearly Headless
_Nick! Nick got the full blast of
 it, but he's a ghost -- he
 couldn't die again...

 was using it to look round
 corners, in case it came along.
_RON
_And Mrs. Norris? I'm pretty sure
 she didn't have a camera or a
 mirror, Harry.
_HARRY
_The water... there was water on
 the floor that night. She only
 saw the Basilisk's reflection...
(scanning the
 page again)
_The crowing of the rooster is
 fatal to it! That's why Hagrid's
 roosters were killed! Spiders
 flee before it! It all fits!
_RON
_But how's the Basilisk been
 getting around? A dirty great
 snake. Someone would have seen...
_HARRY
_Hermione answered that too.
Harry points. Scribbled, in Hermione's hand, is:
"Pipes."
_RON
(aghast)
_Pipes...? It's using the
 plumbing.
_HARRY
_Remember what Aragog said? About
 that girl fifty years ago? She
 died in a bathroom. What if she

McGonagall stands before the desecrated wall, surrounde y the rest of the staff. Harry and Ron creep up th tairwell.
_PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
_As you can see, the Heir of
_Slytherin has left another

 realized. A student has been
 taken by the monster. Into the

 that you've known all along where

Harry and a very upset Ron walk with desperate purpose.
_RON
_She knew something, Harry. She'd
 found out something about the
_Chamber of Secrets. That's why
 she was taken. I mean, she was --
 is -- a pure-blood. There can't
 be any other reason.

(pulling him away)
_C'mon. Let's go see Lockhart. He
 may be a brainless git, but he's
 going to try and get into the

 know...

_Harry. D'you think there's any
 chance at all she's not, you

_Unavoidable. Got to go...

 that stuff you did in your books?
_GILDEROY LOCKHART
_Books can be misleading.
_HARRY
_You wrote them!
_GILDEROY LOCKHART
_My dear boy, do use your common
 sense. My books wouldn't have
 sold half as well if people didn't
 think I'd done all those things.
_No one wants to read about some
 ugly old Armenian warlock, even if
 he did save a village from
 werewolves. He'd look dreadful on
 the front cover. No dress sense
 at all...
_HARRY
_You're a fraud! You've just been
 taking credit for what a load of
 other wizards have done!
_GILDEROY LOCKHART
_Harry, Harry, Harry. There was
 work involved. I had to track
 these people down and ask them
 exactly how they managed to do
 what they did. No, it's not all
 book signings and publicity
 photos. You want fame, you have
 to be prepared for a long, hard
 slog.
_RON
_Is there anything you can do?
_GILDEROY LOCKHART
_Yes, now that you mention it. I'm
 rather gifted with Memory Charms.
_Otherwise, you see, all those
 wizards would've gone blabbing and
_I'd never have sold another book.
_I'm afraid I'll have to do the
 same to you both, lest you do the
 same.

130 INT. GIRLS' BATHROOM - NIGHT 130

Lockhart walks ahead of Harry and Ron, their wand ointed at him. Moaning Myrtle floats above the cistern.
_MOANING MYRTLE
_Who's there? Oh...
(smiles, flirty)
_Hello, Harry. What do you want?
_HARRY
_To ask you how you died.
_MOANING MYRTLE
(flattered)
_Oooooh, it was dreadful. It
 happened right here. In this very
 cubicle. I'd hidden because Olive
_Hornby was teasing me about my
 glasses. I was crying, and then I
 heard somebody come in.
_HARRY
_Who was it, Myrtle?
_MOANING MYRTLE
_I don't know! I was distraught!
_But they said something funny. A
 kind of made-up language. And I
 realized it was a boy speaking.
_So I unlocked the door, to tell
 him to go away, and... I died.
_HARRY
_Just like that? How?

130 CONTINUED: 130

_MOANING MYRTLE
_No idea. I just remember seeing a

_Over there...
Myrtle points to the bank of sinks. Harry and Ron hurr ver, examining the pipes below, the tile above, then.. arry sees it: etched on one of the COPPER TAPS is  INY SNAKE.
_HARRY
_This is it, Ron. This is the
 entrance to the Chamber of
_Secrets.
_RON
_Say something, Harry. Say
 something in Parseltongue.
Harry stares off self-consciously at the tiny snake.
_HARRY
_Open up.
Ron shakes his head. Harry's spoken in his regula oice.
_RON
_English.
Harry concentrates harder this time, staring so intensel hat the snake almost looks alive. When, finally, h peaks, it is more like a HISS. Parseltongue. Th ircular group of sinks OPEN and a LARGE, OPEN PIPE i xposed.
_GILDEROY LOCKHART
_Excellent, Harry. Good work.
_Well then. I'll just be going.
_There's no need for me...
_HARRY
_Oh, yes there is. You first.
Harry points his wand at Lockhart, then the opening.

_A bloody lot of good if it's a
 two-hundred-foot drop onto jagged
 rocks.

Lockhart steps grimly to the dark, gaping hole. Ro ives him a shove and he topples headfirst and out o ight. They wait. Finally...
_GILDEROY LOCKHART (O.S.)
_It's really quite filthy down
 here.
_HARRY
_All right. Let's go.
_MOANING MYRTLE
_Oh, Harry... if you die down
 there, you're welcome to share my
 toilet.
_HARRY
_Thanks, Myrtle.
Harry turns. Jumps. Seconds later, Ron follows.

131 INT. PIPE - NIGHT

Harry and Ron slide wicked fast, in a hair-raisin ertical plummet, catching glimpses of other, smalle ipes branching off in all directions, twisting an urning until the pipe levels off, dumps them onto th amp floor of a stone tunnel.

132 INT. TUNNEL - NIGHT

Lockhart stares miserably at the muck dripping from hi obes. Harry takes a TORCH from the wall, poises hi and.
_HARRY
_Lumos!
The torch blooms with a BRIGHT ORANGE FLAME.

_Remember. Any sign of movement,
 close your eyes straight away.
Harry leads the way down the tunnel. CRUNCH! They loo own: a rat's skull. All around them, the ground i ittered with TINY SKELETONS. Ron squints, see omething HUGE and CURVED lying ahead. When he speaks is voice is hollow with dread CONTINUED)

_What's that? Up ahead?
_GILDEROY LOCKHART
_That looks like a... snake.
Terrified, Lockhart quickly HIDES HIS EYES.
_HARRY
_Maybe it's asleep.
Ron draws his wand as they approach, squinting. Harr hines his light, revealing... a gigantic COIL of EMPT KIN.
_RON
_Bloody hell. Whatever shed this
 must be twenty feet long. Or
 more.
THUD! They turn. Lockhart has passed out.
_RON
_Heart of a lion, this one.
Ron kneels by him, when... Lockhart's eyes open and uick as a fox... he snatches Ron's wand and scrambles t is feet.
_GILDEROY LOCKHART
_The adventure ends here, boys!
_But don't fret. The world will
 know our story. How I was too
 late to save the girl. How you
 two tragically lost your minds at
 the sight of her mangled body.
_I'll even bind a limited edition
 in this snake skin. Say goodbye
 to your memories.

_Obliviate!
Ron's WAND EXPLODES like a small BOMB, BLASTING Lockhar FF HIS FEET and SPITTING great JETS of FIRE into th ock above. As RUBBLE RAINS, Ron LEAPS one way and Harr he other.

_What now?
_HARRY
_Wait here. I'll go on. I'll go

He leaves it there.

_I'll try and shift some of this
 rock. So you can get back

_See you in a bit.
Harry glances at the snake skin at his feet, moves off e steps carefully through the shadows until he reaches  OWERING STONE WALL, carved with TWIN SERPENTS.

_Open.
The serpents part and the GIANT WALL SLIDES OPEN. Harr emoves his wand and ENTERS.

A vast chamber stretches ahead. Along the path are row f STONE SERPENTS. The serpents rest in pools of blac ater. Ahead is an enormous STATUE of SALAZAR SLYTHERIN everal feet in front of the statue, Ginny Weasley lie otionless. As Harry dashes and takes her into his arms er head lolls to one side, cheeks white as marble.  ale hand clutches TOM RIDDLE'S DIARY to her chest arry DROPS the torch, RACES to Ginny, places his wand o he floor and kneels beside her.

_Yes. I'm afraid so. But then,
 she's been in so much pain, poor
_Ginny. She's been writing to me
 for months, telling me all her
 pitiful worries and woes. Ginny
 poured her soul out to me. I grew
 stronger on a diet of her deepest
 fears, her darkest secrets. I
 grew powerful enough to start
 feeding Ginny a few secrets, to
 start pouring a bit of my soul
 back into her...
Riddle, growing less vaporous by the second, grin ruelly.
_TOM RIDDLE
_Yes, Harry, it was Ginny Weasley
 who opened the Chamber of Secrets.
_HARRY
_No... she couldn't -- she
 wouldn't.
_TOM RIDDLE
_It was Ginny who set the Basilisk
 on the Mudbloods and the Squib's
 cat. Ginny who wrote threatening
 messages on the walls.
_HARRY
_But... Why?...
_TOM RIDDLE
_Because I told her to. You'll
 find that I can be very
 persuasive. Not that she knew
 what she was doing. She was,
 shall we say, in a kind of trance.
_Still, the power of the diary
 began to scare her and she tried
 to dispose of it in the girls'
 bathroom. But then, who should
 find it... but you. The very
 person I was most anxious to meet.

_And why did you want to meet me?

_Ginny told me all about you. I
 knew I had to talk to you, meet
 you if I could. So I decided to
 show you my capture of that
 brainless oaf, Hagrid, to gain
 your trust.
_HARRY
_Hagrid's my friend. And you
 framed him, didn't you?
_TOM RIDDLE
_It was my word against Hagrid's.
_Only Dumbledore seemed to think
_Hagrid was innocent.
_HARRY
_I'll bet Dumbledore saw right
 through you.
_TOM RIDDLE
_I knew it wouldn't be safe to open
 the Chamber again while I was
 still at school. So I decided to
 leave behind a diary, preserving
 my sixteen-year-old self in its
 pages, so that one day... I would
 be able to lead another to finish
_Salazar Slytherin's noble work.
_HARRY
_Well, you haven't finished it this
 time. In a few hours Mandrake
_Draught will be ready and everyone
 who was petrified will be all
 right again.
_TOM RIDDLE
_Haven't I told you, that killing
_Mudbloods doesn't matter to me
 anymore? For many months now, my
 new target has been... you.

_Afraid I'd tell you just who it
 was that had been strangling all
 those roosters.
Horrified, Harry glances at Ginny, growing more PALE hen back to Riddle, who is growing more SOLID.
_TOM RIDDLE
_Come now, Harry. Don't look so
 disappointed. Had Ginny succeeded
 in destroying the diary, she would
 have destroyed me. And we
 couldn't be having this little
 talk. And I have so many
 questions for you.
_HARRY
_Like what?
_TOM RIDDLE
_Well, how is it that a baby with
 no extraordinary magical talent
 managed to defeat the greatest
 wizard of all time? How did you
 escape with nothing but a scar,
 while Lord Voldemort's powers were
 destroyed?
_HARRY
_Why do you care how I escaped?
_Voldemort was after your time.
_TOM RIDDLE
_Voldemort is my past, present and
 future.
Riddle pulls Harry's wand from his pocket and begins t race it through the air, writing three words: "TO ARVOLO RIDDLE." Then, with a wave, he re-arranges them:
"I AM LORD VOLDEMORT."

Riddle's face creases in fear. He LUNGES FORWARD. Bu arry is too quick. Raising his hand high... he PLUNGE HE FANG into the book. Instantly, BLACK INK SPURTS fro he pages.
_TOM RIDDLE
_No!
Riddle SHRIEKS, writhing in pain. His body begins t ither instantly, growing BLURRY once more. As the in uns off Harry's fingers to the floor, Riddle VANISHE ltogether. Harry sinks back, then... hears a FAIN OAN. Ginny STIRS, color blooming in her cheeks. As sh ees Harry, she SOBS.
_GINNY
_Harry. It was me! But I swear, I
 didn't mean to... Riddle made me.
_He wrote to me... took me over...
_I didn't even know whose diary it
 was. I found it inside my
 cauldron. The day we all went to
_Diagon Alley and... Harry. You're
 hurt...
_HARRY
_Ginny. You need to get yourself
 out... Follow the chamber...
_You'll find Ron...
There is a RUSH OF WINGS and Fawkes circles down, lay is head onto Harry's arm.
_HARRY
_You were brilliant, Fawkes. I
 just... wasn't quick enough.
Then Harry blinks, looks down. Thick pearly TEARS ar rickling down Fawkes' face and onto his arm. Almos nstantly, his wound... begins to heal itself CONTINUED)


133B CONTINUED: (3) 133B

_HARRY
_Of course. Dumbledore told me.
_Phoenix tears have healing powers.
(looking up at Ginny)
_It's all right, Ginny. It's over.
_It's just a memory...

134 INT. TUNNEL - NIGHT (LATER)

With Fawkes gliding gracefully ahead of them, Harry an inny make their way back. Up ahead, SHIFTING ROCK ca e heard and a jagged fissure of LIGHT GLIMMERS. Ron' ace appears.
_RON
_Ginny!
Ron wriggles through, rushes forward and hugs Ginny.
_RON
_You're alive. I can't believe it.
_GINNY
_I'm going to be expelled, I just
 know it!
_RON
(to Harry)
_Remind you of anyone?
_HARRY
_Where's Lockhart?
Harry eyes Lockhart, sitting by himself, HUMMIN lacidly.
_RON
_His Memory Charm backfired.
_Hasn't got a clue who he is. I
 keep having to stop him wandering
 off. He's a danger to himself.
_GILDEROY LOCKHART
_Hello. Odd sort of place, this,
 isn't it? Do you live here?
_RON
_No.
Ron turns, raises his eyebrows at Harry. Harry look pward. There is an opening, hundreds of feet up. Jus hen, Fawkes circles back, fluttering in front of Harry CONTINUED HE CHAMBER OF SECRETS - Rev. 4/16/02 130.

134 CONTINUED:

_RON
_What's with the bird?
_HARRY
_I think... I think he's telling me
 he can take us out of here.

134A INT. ROCKY TUNNEL - NIGHT (LATER) 134A

A CURIOUS, GLIDING SHADOW RIPPLES across the cavernou all, and then Harry, Ron, Ginny and Lockhart soar out o he darkness, linked hand in hand. Fawkes is flying the ome.
_GILDEROY LOCKHART
_Amazing! This is just like magic!

135 INT. DUMBLEDORE'S OFFICE - DAY

Harry and Ron, covered in muck and slime -- stand i umbledore's office. Fawkes perches on a pedestal behin umbledore, who sits at his desk, examining the charre iary. He looks up, regarding Harry and Ron gravely.
_DUMBLEDORE
_Ingenious. Simply... ingenious.
(looking up)
_Of course, Tom Riddle was probably
 the most brilliant student
_Hogwarts has ever seen. I taught
 him myself fifty years ago. After
 he left, I would occasionally hear
 stories of his activities -- dark
 rumors -- but after awhile, even
 the rumors stopped. When he
 finally resurfaced as Lord
_Voldemort, most people had
 completely forgotten the clever
_Head Boy he'd once been.
_GINNY
_I didn't know whose diary it was,
 sir. I swear. I found it inside
 my cauldron.
(to the others)
_The day we all went to Diagon
_Alley.
(CONTINUED HE CHAMBER OF SECRETS - Rev. 4/17/02

135 CONTINUED:

Hearing this, Harry frowns in thought, recollecting...
_GINNY
_But I understand if... given all
 the trouble I've caused... if
 you --
_DUMBLEDORE
_Wiser wizards than you have been
 hoodwinked by Lord Voldemort, Miss
_Weasley. No, I think you've
 endured enough. I would suggest a
 bit of bed rest, however. And
 perhaps a large mug of hot
 chocolate. I always find that
 cheers me up. Minerva, will you
 show Arthur and Molly up to the
 hospital wing?
_PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
_Certainly, Albus.
As they exit, Harry and Ron watch them go. Mrs easley's VOICE carries:
_MRS. WEASLEY
_A diary that writes back to you!
_Honestly, Ginny! What were you
 thinking? Haven't I always told
 you? Never trust anything that
 can think for itself if you can't
 see where it keeps its brain!
Harry and Ron turn back. See Dumbledore regarding the ravely.
_DUMBLEDORE
_You two realize, of course, that
 in the last few hours, you have
 broken perhaps a dozen school
 rules?
_HARRY/RON
_Yes, sir.
_DUMBLEDORE
_And that there is sufficient
 evidence to expel you both?
_HARRY/RON
_Yes, sir.
(CONTINUED HE CHAMBER OF SECRETS - Rev. 4/17/02 131A.

135 CONTINUED: (1A)

_DUMBLEDORE
_Therefore, it seems only
 fitting...
(eyes twinkling)
_That you both receive Special
_Awards for Services to the School.
_And -- let me see -- yes, I think
 two hundred points apiece, which,
_I believe, should be more than
 enough to secure Gryffindor the
_House Cup.
(CONTINUED HE CHAMBER OF SECRETS - Rev. 4/16/02

135 CONTINUED: (2)

_HARRY/RON
(grinning)
_Thank you, sir.
_DUMBLEDORE
_Now, Mr. Weasley, if you would,
 have an owl deliver these release
 papers to Azkaban. We need our
 gamekeeper back.
Ron nods, takes the envelope and exits.
_DUMBLEDORE
_First, Harry, I want to thank you.
_You must have shown me real
 loyalty down in the Chamber.
_Nothing but that could have called
_Fawkes to you. Secondly, I sense
 you're troubled by something. Am
_I right?
_HARRY
_It's just, you see, sir, I
 couldn't help noticing certain
 things. Certain similarities.
_Between Tom Riddle and me.
(CONTINUED HE CHAMBER OF SECRETS - Rev. 3/1/02

135 CONTINUED: (3)

_DUMBLEDORE
_You can speak Parseltongue, Harry,
 because Lord Voldemort can speak
_Parseltongue. Unless I'm much
 mistaken, he transformed some of
 his own powers to you the night he
 gave you that scar.
_HARRY
_Voldemort put a bit of himself in
 me?
_DUMBLEDORE
_Not intentionally, but... yes.
_HARRY
_So the Sorting Hat was right. I
 should be a Slytherin.
_DUMBLEDORE
_It's true, Harry. You do possess
 many of the qualities Voldemort
 himself prizes. Resourcefulness.
_Determination. A certain
 disregard for the rules. Yet the
_Sorting Hat placed you in
_Gryffindor.
_HARRY
_Only because I asked it to.
_DUMBLEDORE
_Exactly. Which makes you very
 different from Voldemort. It's
 not our abilities that show what
 we truly are, Harry. It's our
 choices.
(smiling at him)
_If you want proof that you belong
 in Gryffindor, Harry, I suggest
 you look more closely at this.
Dumbledore hands the bloodstained sword to Harry. A NGRAVED NAME glimmers above the ruby-encrusted hilt.
_HARRY
 'Godric Gryffindor.'
_DUMBLEDORE
_Only a true Gryffindor could have
 pulled that out of the Hat.
THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS - Rev. 3/1/02

135 CONTINUED: (4)

Suddenly, Lucius Malfoy enters, dragging... Dobby by th ar.
_HARRY
_Dobby! This is your Master? The
 family you serve is the Malfoys!
Dobby nods, chagrined. Lucius Malfoy brushes past Harry.
_LUCIUS MALFOY
_Out of my way, Potter.
(to Dumbledore)
_So! You've returned!
_DUMBLEDORE
_Yes. When the governors heard
 that Arthur Weasley's daughter had
 been taken into the Chamber, they
 saw fit to summon me back.
(a wry smile)
_Curiously, several of them seemed
 under the impression that you
 would curse their families if they
 didn't agree to suspend me in the
 first place, Lucius.
_LUCIUS MALFOY
_From the beginning, my only
 concern has been the welfare of
 this school and its students.
_I assume the culprit has been
 identified.
_DUMBLEDORE
_Oh yes. It was Voldemort. Only
 this time, he chose to act through
 someone else. By means of...
 this.
As Dumbledore nudges the diary toward Lucius Malfoy arry sees Dobby nod meaningfully from the diary t ucius.
_DUMBLEDORE
_Fortunately, our young Mr. Potter
 discovered it.
(a chill to his voice)
_One only hopes that no more of
_Lord Voldemort's old school things
 find their way into innocent
 hands. The consequences for the
 one responsible could be...
 severe.
(CONTINUED HE CHAMBER OF SECRETS - Rev. 3/1/02

135 CONTINUED: (5)

Lucius Malfoy stares icily at Dumbledore, then turn way.
_LUCIUS MALFOY
_Come, Dobby. We're leaving.
As Dobby scuttles toward the door, Lucius Malfoy KICK IM through it, then exits himself. Harry stares at th mpty doorway as DOBBY'S PAINFUL SQUEALS ECHO from th orridor.
_HARRY
_Sir? I wonder if I could have
 that.
Dumbledore looks up, follows Harry's eyes to the diary.

135A EXT. DUMBLEDORE'S OFFICE - DAY (MOMENTS LATER) 135A

As the elevator opens, Harry dashes out.
_HARRY
_Mr. Malfoy! I have something of
 yours.
Harry comes up running, thrusts the diary into Malfoy' and.
_LUCIUS MALFOY
_Mine? I don't know what you're
 talking about.
_HARRY
_I think you do, sir. I think you
 slipped it into Ginny Weasley's
 cauldron that day in Diagon Alley.
Malfoy shoves the diary into Dobby's face, then lean lose to Harry and, with a nasty grin, WHISPERS:
_LUCIUS MALFOY
_Prove it!
He turns away. As Dobby looks sadly back, clutching th iary in his hand, Harry mouths the words: Open it obby looks down curiously. Inside... is a SOCK. H ASPS.
_LUCIOUS MALFOY
_Dobby!
_Dobby, come!
(CONTINUED HE CHAMBER OF SECRETS - Rev. 4/3/02

135A CONTINUED: 135A

_DOBBY
(in wonderment)
_Master has given Dobby a sock.
_Master has presented Dobby with
 clothes. Dobby is... free!
_LUCIUS MALFOY
_What? I didn't --
He wheels, sees Harry standing with one leg crossed: Hi ight ankle is bare. Instantly, Malfoy charges forth.
_LUCIUS MALFOY
_You've lost me my servant!
_DOBBY
_You shall not harm Harry Potter!
Dobby steps between and -- BANG! Malfoy flies backwards ands in a crumpled heap. Rising, he stares murderousl t Harry.
_LUCIUS MALFOY
_Mark my words, Harry Potter.
_You'll meet the same sticky end as
 your parents one of these days.
_They were meddlesome fools too.
With that, he turns, storms off.
_DOBBY
_Harry Potter freed Dobby! How can
_Dobby ever repay him?
_HARRY
_Just promise me something.
_DOBBY
_Anything, sir.
_HARRY
_Never try to save my life again.
Dobby grins then and -- CRACK! -- is gone.

Colin Creevey SNAPS photos of th roceedings t the rear of the hall, standing near the entrance ilch is reunited with Mrs. Norris. Then... Hermion nters, searching the room for Harry and Ron. Finally he sees them. Smiles. Runs forward and embraces Harry.
_HERMIONE
_You solved it! You solved it!
_HARRY
_With loads of help from you.
She turns to embrace Ron. They pause, an awkward momen etween them and... shake hands instead.
_RON
_Welcome back, Hermione.
McGonagall taps her goblet. Dumbledore stands.
_DUMBLEDORE
_Before we begin our feast, let's
 give a round of applause to

_Pomfrey, whose Mandrake Juice has
 been successfully administered to
 all those who had been petrified.
Everyone applauds.

At the rear of the Hall, the great doors OPEN. It' agrid. He enters. Stops. Looks around. The roo alls SILENT. All eyes upon him. He glances around ervous. Embarrassed.
