EXT. COLORADO SPRINGS STREET - DAY
RON STALLWORTH, Black, 21, Handsome, Intelligent, sporting a
good sized Afro, rebellious but straight laced by most 1970's
standards.
Ron stares at an Ad attached to a bulletin board.

INT. OFFICE OF CHIEF BRIDGES - COLORADO SPRINGS POLICE DEPT -
"DAY"
A drab, white-walled office. Ron sits across the table from
The Assistant City Personnel Manager, MR. TURRENTINE, Black,
40's, business like but progressive and CHIEF BRIDGES, White,
smart, 50's, in a Police Uniform, a Man ready for change.
_MR. TURRENTINE
"Why weren't you drafted into the Vietnam War?"
_RON STALLWORTH
"I went to College."
_MR. TURRENTINE
"How do you feel about Vietnam?"
_RON STALLWORTH
"I have mixed feelings."
_CHIEF BRIDGES
Would you call yourself a Womanizer?
_RON STALLWORTH
"No Sir, I would not."
_MR. TURRENTINE
"Do you frequent Night Clubs?"
_RON STALLWORTH
"No Sir."
_CHIEF BRIDGES
"Do you drink?"
_RON STALLWORTH
"On Special occasions, Sir."
_MR. TURRENTINE
"Have you ever done any Drugs?"
_RON STALLWORTH
"Only those prescribed by My Doctor, Sir."
Turrentine looks at Chief Bridges.
_MR. TURRENTINE
"That's kind of rare these days for a young Hip Soul Brother like you."
_RON STALLWORTH
"I know but my Father was in The Military and I was raised up the Right way, Sir."
_CHIEF BRIDGES
"How are you with people, generally?"
_RON STALLWORTH
"Sir, they treat me right, I treat them right, like I already said I was raised..."
_CHIEF BRIDGES
"...Have you ever had any negative..."
Mr. Turrentine jumps in, impatient.
_MR. TURRENTINE
"...What would you do if another Cop called you a Nigger?"
_RON STALLWORTH
"Would that happen..."
_MR. TURRENTINE
"...Sheeeeeeettt!!!"
Bridges looks at him. Turrentine waits, Ron doesn't know how
to respond, finally. Turrentine leans forward.
_MR. TURRENTINE (CONT'D)
"There's never been a Black Cop in this City. If we make you an Officer, you would, in effect, be the Jackie Robinson of the Colorado Springs Police force."
Mr. Turrentine lets this sink in.
_MR. TURRENTINE (CONT'D)
"And if you know anything about Jackie Robinson you know he had to take a lot of... guff... from his fellow Teammates, from Fans, other Teams, and The Press."
_RON STALLWORTH
"I know Jackie's Story, Sir."
_MR. TURRENTINE
"Good. So, knowing that, when someone calls you Nigger will you be able to turn the other Cheek?"
Ron evaluates the hard reality of the question. Decides.
_RON STALLWORTH
"If I need to, yes, Sir."
_MR. TURRENTINE
"Son, The Mayor and I think you might be The Man to open things up here."
Ron looks at Chief Bridges.
_CHIEF BRIDGES

looking at a Photo of something good.
Ron looks at the Photo of the Actress Cybill Shepherd.
_RON STALLWORTH
"Cybill Shepherd. She was great in The Last Picture Show."
_OFFICER MULANEY
"Never saw it but what you think?"
_RON STALLWORTH
"She's a very good Actress."
_OFFICER MULANEY
"Y'know you want some of that."
Ron ignores it.
_OFFICER MULANEY (CONT'D)
"Truth be told when I see one of your kind with a White Woman it turns my Stomach."
_RON STALLWORTH
"Yeah. Why's that?"
_OFFICER MULANEY
"He could only want one thing."
_RON STALLWORTH
"What would that be?"
_OFFICER MULANEY
"You like acting dumb, Y'know."
_RON STALLWORTH
"No, I just like my questions to be answered."
A VOICE of UNIFORMED COP WHEATON calls from the other side of
the Counter.
_WHEATON (O.S.)
"Hey! Anybody in there? Looking for a Toad here."
Ron walks to the Counter to see The White and sleep-deprived
Cop impatiently leaning on his elbows.
_WHEATON (CONT'D)
"Get me the record for this Toad named Tippy Birdsong."
Ron pulls up the File for Tippy Birdsong. The Photo shows a
Black Man in his twenties.
_WHEATON (CONT'D)
"While you're at it, why don't you grab another Toad... Steven Wilson."
Ron pulls the File... another young Black Male, ANOTHER
SEXUAL PREDATOR!
INT. CSPD HALLWAY - DAY
Chief Bridges strides down the hall with SGT. TRAPP a soft-
spoken White Man in his 40's, they are discussing a File. Ron
suddenly appears walking with them.
_RON STALLWORTH
"While I've got you both here. Sirs, I'd like to be an Undercover Detective."
Chief Bridges and Sgt. Trapp both stop.
_CHIEF BRIDGES
"What Narcotics?"
_RON STALLWORTH
"Whatever Department works, Sir."
_SGT. TRAPP
"You just joined The Force, Rookie."
_RON STALLWORTH
"I know, Sir but I think I could do some good there."
_SGT. TRAPP
"Is that right?"
_RON STALLWORTH
"Well, I'm young. I think there's a niche for me. Get In where I can Fit In."
_SGT. TRAPP
"What do you think, Chief?"
Sgt. Trapp sees the logic, looks to Chief Bridges, who stops,
considering.
_CHIEF BRIDGES
"Think a lot of yourself, don't cha?"
_RON STALLWORTH
"Just trying to be of help, Chief. Plus, I hate working in The Records room."
Sgt. Trapp reacts knowing Ron shouldn't have said that about
the Records Room. CHIEF BRIDGES looks at Ron, matter of fact.
_CHIEF BRIDGES
"Well, I think Records is a good place for you to start, Rookie."
_RON STALLWORTH
"Chief, want me clean shaven?"
_CHIEF BRIDGES
"Keep it. I like the look."
Chief Bridges walks off without another word. SGT. TRAPP
gives a knowing look to Ron, who watches them walk away.
INT. RECORDS ROOM - CSPD - DAY
Ron behind the Counter. MASTER PATROLMAN ANDY LANDERS, White,
Mid-30's, a regular guy but there is something dangerous
there, steps up.
_LANDERS
"Need a File on a Toad."
Ron doesn't respond.
_LANDERS (CONT'D)
"You Deaf? I said I need info on a Toad."
_RON STALLWORTH
"No Toads here."
_LANDERS
"Excuse me?"
_RON STALLWORTH
"I said, I don't have any Toads. I do have Human Beings and if you give me their names I can pull the Files."
Landers scowls. Ron stares back at him, Eye to Eye.
_LANDERS
"Heard you think you Hot Shit but you ain't nuthin' but a Cold Fart. Name's Maurice, Maurice Smalls...That respectful enough for you, Officer Toad."
Ron pulls The File, throws it down on the Counter as Landers
snatches The File and storms off.
INT. RON'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - MORNING
As Ron sleeps, a phone rings. Ron snaps awake and grabs at
the phone on the night table.
_RON STALLWORTH
"Hello."
_CHIEF BRIDGES (O.S.)
"It's Bridges. You sleeping?"
_RON STALLWORTH
"Yes, Chief, I was. Just worked a Night Shift."

ahead.
INT. CSPD - NARCOTICS DIVISION - DAY
Ron, dressed in Bell-Bottoms and a Hip Italian Knit Shirt,
Marshmallow Shoes steps inside the Narcotics office, which is
literally The Basement of The Station. He looks around at The
Area Buzzing with Activity and sees
ANGLE - UNDERCOVER COPS
at their desks. Looking less like Cops and more like unkempt
Hippies or Rock N' Rollers.

CLOSE - FLIP ZIMMERMAN
_FLIP
"Rookie, you're late."
_RON STALLWORTH
"Sorry, it won't happen again."
Flip, late 30's, long hair, looks like anything but a Cop, he
however is somewhat of a closed-off guy, all business, Ron
sits across from him. Chief Bridges steps before them.
_CHIEF BRIDGES (CONT'D)
"We've got limited time so I'll be quick. That Black Radical Stokely Carmichael is giving a Speech Tonight at Bell's Nightingale."
Ron is surprised at this.
_RON STALLWORTH
"The Nightclub?"
_CHIEF BRIDGES
"No, Emmanuel Missionary Baptist Church!!!"
Flip just listens.
_CHIEF BRIDGES (CONT'D)
"Carmichael is a former High Muckity- Muck with The Black Panthers and as far as I'm concerned, FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover was dead right when he said The Black Panthers are The Greatest Internal Threat to The Security of these United States. This Carmichael Joker, former Panther or not, they say he's a Damn Good Speaker and we don't want this Carmichael getting into The Minds of the Black People here in Colorado Springs and stirring them up."
Ron's face cringes at Chief Bridges's words. He steps to Ron.
_CHIEF BRIDGES (CONT'D)
"Ron, your assignment is to go to this Speech tonight and infiltrate these Bunch of Subversives and monitor The Audience reaction to Carmichael. You ready?"
Flip and Chief Bridges stare at Ron.
_RON STALLWORTH
"Born Ready."
INT. NARCOTICS DIVISION - CSPD - NIGHT
Ron stands, his shirt off, as Flip wires a Wireless
Transmitter and Microphone to his body. Another Narcotics
Cop, JIMMY CREEK, 30's, observes the installation.
_RON STALLWORTH
"Any chance this thing Fucks Up?"
_FLIP
"Fuck yeah."
_RON STALLWORTH
"Then what?"
_JIMMY
"Just stick to The Game Plan."
_RON STALLWORTH
"Which is?"
_FLIP
"Improvise. Like Jazz. This isn't some Big Bust. We just want some Intel, that's it."
_JIMMY
"What happens if someone offers you a Marijuana Cigarette?"
_RON STALLWORTH
"You mean a Joint?"
_JIMMY
"Yeah."
_RON STALLWORTH
""Soul Brother, I'm already High on Life. Can you Dig It?""
_FLIP
"And if someone pulls a Gun on you?"
Ron is caught off guard.
_RON STALLWORTH
"You expecting that?"
Flip pulls his Gun.
_FLIP
"Barrel of a 45's in your face, Finger on the Trigger, now what?"
_RON STALLWORTH
"Blood, get that Gun out my face. Peace Love and Soul."
_FLIP
"Gun is still in your face."
Ron gives Jimmy a wary look speaking to Flip.
_RON STALLWORTH
"I de-escalate. Talk calmly, firmly. Find a way out of there, A-Sap."
Jimmy nods, satisfied. Flip is finished with The Wiring. Ron
takes a deep breath.
_FLIP
"Relax, we'll be outside, listening in."
_RON STALLWORTH
"Can I order a Drink at The Bar?"
Flip steps away, no comment.
_JIMMY
"That's fine, just don't get Shit Faced."
_FLIP
"Got it?"
_RON STALLWORTH
"I got it. I'm gone."
Jimmy laughs, Slaps Ron on the back.
EXT. CITY STREET - OUTSKIRTS OF DOWNTOWN - NIGHT
Ron pulls an unmarked Sedan to the curb. He gets out and
looks around.
A Crowded sidewalk overflows into The Street, filling a line
that Bottlenecks into The Club with the Sign: 
CLOSE SIGN - BELL'S NIGHTINGALE
ANGLE - TONIGHT: KWAME TURE SPEAKS
Ron walks to the back of the line. He becomes an Every
Brother slowly moving forward as People enter. As he moves
forward he notices a striking Woman at the Front Door.
ANGLE - PATRICE DUMAS
Mid 20's, an Angela Davis Afro, she wears a Hip array of
Militant wear, Black Leather Jacket, Love Beads but on her it
looks fantastic. Ron is taken by her Beauty, he watches as
she monitors the door, clearly in charge.
_RON STALLWORTH
"How are you doing, my Soul Sista?"
Patrice gives Ron a good look summing him up.
_PATRICE
"I'm doing fine, my Brother. This is going to be an Amazing Night."
_RON STALLWORTH
"Indeed it is."
_PATRICE
"Have you heard Brother Kwame speak before?"
_RON STALLWORTH
"Who?"
_PATRICE
"Kwame Ture."
_RON STALLWORTH
"Actually, I haven't, I didn't know he changed his name."
_PATRICE
"Yes, after he moved to Africa. He took the names of Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana and his Mentor Sekou Toure of Guinea to honor The Great Leaders."
_RON STALLWORTH
"That's Heavy. Do you know how he got to Colorado Springs?"
_PATRICE
"The Colorado College Black Student Union invited Brother Ture."
_RON STALLWORTH
"I can dig it. I can dig it. You with The Black Student Union?"
_PATRICE
"I'm The President."
_RON STALLWORTH
"Right On. Right On."
INT. BELL'S NIGHTINGALE - NIGHT
The Club is PACKED, a Sea of Black Faces punctuated by an
occasional White Face. Ron moves through The Crowd. He avoids
direct Eye Contact, trying like Hell to act casual.
Ron steps to The Bar and signals The BARTENDER JABBO, 60's,
Black.
_RON STALLWORTH
"Rum and Coke with Lime."
As Jabbo makes his Drink, something catches Ron's Eye.
Patrice exits through a door with several Black Bodyguards.
Ron observes as a Tall figure comes out from Backstage with
Patrice, ODETTA and HAKEEM. The Tall figure hangs back
covered by The Bodyguards.
Ron on his feet, Black Fist in the air with The Crowd.
Patrice on Stage with Kwame Ture with her Fist raised too.
The Shouting and Chanting finally cease, as Patrice speaks.
_PATRICE
"The Black Student Union of Colorado College is honored to bring The Vanguard of Revolutionaries fighting for The Rights of Black People all over The World. Let's show some Black Love to The One and Only, The Former Prime Minister of The Black Panther Party, The Brother Man with The Plan who's stickin'it to the Man, put your Hands together my People... for Our Kwame Ture."
PANDEMONIUM! As Kwame Ture walks onto a small raised stage
with Patrice. The entire place rises to their Feet, Fists
Raised, Clapping, Shouting "Ungawa Black Power!" Ron watches
as Patrice and Kwame hug. Patrice sits on Stage with Odetta
and Hakeem.
Kwame soaks in the Crowd's reaction, until...
_KWAME TURE
"Thank you all for coming out tonight, My Beloved Sista's and Brotha's. I Thank you..."
CLOSE - KWAME TURE
towering at Six Feet-Four with an infectious smile and
Flawless Dark Skin, he's oozing Charisma out of every pore.
He stands behind a small podium.
_KWAME TURE (CONT'D)
"...I'm here to tell you this evening it is time for you to stop running away from being Black. You are College Students, you should think."
_KWAME TURE (CONT'D)
"It is time for you to understand that you as The growing Intellectuals of this Country, you must define Beauty for Black People, Now that's Black Power."
_BLACK MASS
"BLACK POWER!!! BLACK POWER!!!"
The Black Students in The Audience are laser focused on him.
_KWAME TURE
"Is Beauty defined by someone with a Narrow Nose? Thin Lips? White Skin? You ain't got none of that. If your Lips are Thick, Bite them in. Hold your Nose! Don't drink Coffee because it makes you Black!"
The Audience laughs! Loving it.
_KWAME TURE (CONT'D)
"Your Nose is Boss, your Lips are Thick, your skin is Black, you are Black and you are Beautiful!"
Everyone cheers including Ron!
_KWAME TURE (CONT'D)
"We want to be like The White people that oppress us in this Country and since they hate us, we hate ourselves. You dig Tarzan? I remember that when I was a Boy I used to go see Tarzan Movies on Saturdays. I loved me some Jane too. Jane was A Fine White Woman. White Tarzan used to Beat up The Black Natives. I would sit there yelling "Kill The Beasts, Kill The Savages, Kill 'Em!" Actually I was saying: "Kill Me." It was as if a Jewish Boy watched Nazis taking Jews off to Concentration Camps and cheered them on. Today, I want The Chief to beat The Hell out of Tarzan and send him back to The Caves of Europe. But it takes time to become Free of The Lies and their shaming effect on Black Minds. It takes time to reject the most Important Lie: that Black People inherently can't do the same things White People can do unless White People help them."
The Audience laughing, overwhelmed, shouting back support! A
ROAR from The Crowd. Ron finds himself clapping along.
_RON STALLWORTH
"Right on!!! Right On!!!"
Ron looks around at everyone caught up in Kwame's spell.
_KWAME TURE (CONT'D)
"If a White Man wants to Lynch Me, that's his Problem. If he's got The Power to Lynch Me, that's My Problem. Racism is not a question of Attitude; it's a question of Power."
Ron is struck by the remark.
_KWAME TURE (CONT'D)
"The vast majority of Negroes in this Country live in Captive Communities and must endure their conditions of Oppression because and only because they are Black and Powerless. Now We are being shot down like Dogs in the streets by White Racist Police. We can no longer accept this Oppression without retribution. The War in Vietnam is Illegal and Immoral. I'd rather see a Brother Kill a Cop than Kill a Vietnamese. At least he's got a reason for Killing The Cop. When you Kill a Vietnamese you're a Hero and you don't even know why you Killed him. At least if you Kill a Cop you're doing it for a reason."
Another Applause Break.
CLOSE - RON
Ron listens, challenged, torn.
INT. BELL'S NIGHTINGALE - NIGHT
Kwame holds The Crowd in The Palm of his Hand. Members of the
Audience who were sitting already are rising to their Feet...
CLOSE - RON
sits, claps vigorously, as if forgetting he is Undercover...
CLOSE - KWAME
_KWAME TURE (CONT'D)
"In closing I know it's getting late, may I leave you Sista's and Brothers with these Last Words. "If I am not for myself, who will be? If I am for myself alone, who am I? If not now, when? And if not you, who?" We need an Undying Love for Black People wherever We may be. Good Night and POWER TO THE PEOPLE, POWER TO THE PEOPLE."
The BLACK MASS STANDS AS ONE WITH KWAME TURE.
_KWAME TURE AND BLACK MASS
"ALL POWER TO ALL THE PEOPLE ALL POWER TO ALL THE PEOPLE ALL POWER TO ALL THE PEOPLE"
Caught up in the moment, Ron gathers himself, as if
remembering why he is here. Kwame takes Patrice's Hand and
raises it in Celebration and Unity!
INT. BELL'S NIGHTINGALE - NIGHT
Ron moves down the Greeting Line for Kwame. He watches as
Patrice stands near him. Kwame pulls her in close, whispers
something in her ear. She smiles, a bit smitten.
Ron watches as he finally reaches Kwame, shaking his hand.
_RON STALLWORTH
"Brother Ture, do you really think a War between The Black and White Race is inevitable?"
Kwame pulls Ron in close toward his face. Too close.
INT. SURVEILLANCE CAR - BELL'S NIGHTINGALE - NIGHT

INT. BELL'S NIGHTINGALE - NIGHT
Ron stands mid-grip with Kwame. Nerves pinballing. Kwame
lowers his voice, looking around conspiratorially.
_KWAME TURE
"Brother, arm yourself. Get ready. The Revolution is coming. We must pick up a Gun and prepare ourselves...Trust me, it is coming."
Kwame pulls back. Returns to his normal speaking voice.
_KWAME TURE (CONT'D)
"Thank you for your support, Brother."
EXT. BELL'S NIGHTINGALE - FRONT ENTRANCE - NIGHT
Ron is waiting outside as Patrice steps out, followed by
Odetta and Hakeem. Ron nears her.
_RON STALLWORTH
"I don't know what you have planned now but maybe I could buy you a Drink?"
_PATRICE
"I'm waiting for Brother Kwame, I have to make sure he gets back safely to the Hotel and he's squared away."
_RON STALLWORTH
"I can dig it."
Ron starts to walk away.
_PATRICE
"Maybe, if it's not too late, I'll meet you at The Red Lantern. You know where that is?"
_RON STALLWORTH
"I do."
_PATRICE
"So I'll see you then."
_RON STALLWORTH
"Cool. All Power to All The People."
INT. RED LANTERN INN - NIGHT
Black folks are dancing, getting down. At the bar, Ron looks
at his watch having been there a while. He finishes his Rum
and Coke with Lime watching the door open but it is not
Patrice. He decides to call it a Night, stepping off his
stool, paying his Tab to BRO POPE, The Bartender when...
_PATRICE
"Sorry I'm late..."
Patrice is right there near him. She flops down on the Bar
stool, exhausted, and lights up a Kool Cigarette.
_PATRICE (CONT'D)
"...You won't believe what happened."
Patrice says to Bro Pope, The BARTENDER.
_PATRICE (CONT'D)
"Bro Pope, Seven and Seven, please... The Pigs pulled us over."
_RON STALLWORTH
"Say what?"
_PATRICE
"Yeah, they knew Brother Kwame was in Town. Made us get out the Car. Pigs pulled us over for no reason. Total harassment."
_RON STALLWORTH
"True?"
_PATRICE
"Truth. Do Four Dogs have Four Assholes?"

EXT. COLORADO SPRINGS STREET - NIGHT
Patrice's Car is pulled over and a Uniformed Cop gets out his
Squad Car revealing Master Patrolman Landers. He instructs
them all with his hand on his Revolver.
_PATRICE (V.O.)(CONT'D)
"We're tired of Police Brutality. We're tired of Police Murdering Black Folks."
_LANDERS
"All right everybody out the vehicle. Now!!!"
Kwame, Patrice, Hakeem, and Odetta climb out of the vehicle.
Landers pushes Kwame against the Car.
_LANDERS (CONT'D)
"I don't wanna see nuthin' but Black Asses and Black Elbows. Spread 'em!!!"
Kwame, Patrice, Hakeem and Odetta are all Spread Eagle
against the Car. Master Patrolman Landers pats them down.
Another Police Cruiser pulls up. TWO MORE COPS, SHARPE and
CINCER, both White 50's, get out and observe.
CLOSE - LANDERS
He takes Extra Time patting down Patrice getting some
"Groping" in for Good Measure.
_LANDERS (CONT'D)
"Search The Car. I know these Niggers are holding something."
Cincer and Sharpe enter Patrice's Car, searching it. Landers
turns Kwame around, facing him.
_LANDERS (CONT'D)
"You that so called Big Shot Panther Nigger aren't you? Heard you was in Town, Stokely."
_KWAME TURE
"My Name is Kwame Ture."
Landers stares him down for a moment. You think he's gonna
slug him but he thinks better. The other Cops go through the
Car searching, throwing things around.
_LANDERS
"I know you Black Bastards are holding. What you got in there some Weed, Pills, Heroin?"
Patrice, Kwame, Odetta, and Hakeem and the others just stare
back, silent.
_OFFICER CINCER
"It's clean."
Nothing more to say. Landers gets in Patrice's Face.
_LANDERS
"You get this Black Panther outta' Colorado Springs before Sunrise. Hear ME??? Or you all go to Jail."

INT. RED LANTERN INN - NIGHT
Patrice at the Bar with Ron, he is stunned.
_RON STALLWORTH
"Did you see the Officer's names?"
_PATRICE
"I know I should have but the whole thing was so frightening... I didn't."
Bro Pope, The Bartender sets the Drink down. Patrice takes a
gulp, her hand shaking. Ron observes.
_RON STALLWORTH
"I'm sorry."
Patrice nods, pulls herself together. Ron looks at her,
softly touches her on her back, trying to comfort, thinking
to himself, torn in many directions.
INT. CSPD - CHIEF BRIDGES' OFFICE - DAY
_CHIEF BRIDGES
"What was the Room like?"
_RON STALLWORTH
"Folks were hanging on every word."
_CHIEF BRIDGES
"Sounds like he had them pretty riled up?"
_RON STALLWORTH
"But I'm not sure that means Black Folks were ready to start a Revolution."
_CHIEF BRIDGES
"What makes you think that?"
_RON STALLWORTH
"Nobody was talking about that. That wasn't the Mood. Everybody was Cool."
_CHIEF BRIDGES
"So let me get this straight. He told a Crowd of "Black Folks" to get ready for a Race War. That they were going to have to arm themselves and kill Cops. What about that?"

"Yeah, he said that but I think that was just talk. You know, Rhetoric."
_FLIP
"That's what I thought too."
_CHIEF BRIDGES
"Thank God, Carmichael has left Colorado Springs."
_RON STALLWORTH
"Kwame Ture."
_CHIEF BRIDGES
"What?"
_RON STALLWORTH
"He changed his name from Stokely Carmichael to Kwame Ture."
Chief Bridges humored by as if he is suppose to care.
_CHIEF BRIDGES
"I don't care if he changed his name to Muhammad Ali, he's still dangerous."
Chief Bridges starts to leave the room. Ron decides to say
it.
_RON STALLWORTH
"Did you hear the Story Patrice told me about how the CSPD pulled over her and Ture?"
Chief Bridges stops, drinks in the question. Everything goes
silent. He then gives Ron a deliberate look.
_CHIEF BRIDGES
"No. We didn't hear that."
From Chief Bridges's look, Ron knows he did. Jimmy, Flip
stare at Ron. A Big White Elephant in the room.
_CHIEF BRIDGES (CONT'D)
"Patrice. Isn't she the one from The Black Student Union? They brought Too- Ray in."
_RON STALLWORTH
"Kwame Ture, Correct."
_CHIEF BRIDGES
"You getting pretty Chummy with her?"
If Ron pushes it more he knows it will go bad. He drops it.
_RON STALLWORTH
"Just doing my job, Chief. Undercover."
_CHIEF BRIDGES
"Yeah and it better not be Under the Cover Of The Sheets."
Flip and Jimmy chuckle.
_RON STALLWORTH
"I would never jeopardize a Case..."
_CHIEF BRIDGES
"... you don't know what you would do, you just got here."
Ron takes this in. Dejected.
_FLIP
"Good work."
_JIMMY
"Rookie."
Ron nods, appreciative.
_CHIEF BRIDGES
"Ron, let's take a walk."

"OMITTED"
INT. INTELLIGENCE UNIT - CSPD - DAY
Ron at his desk in The Intelligence Office in Street Clothing
among his COLLEAGUES. He sips Lipton Tea with Honey and
looking through various Publications. He then picks up The
Colorado Springs Gazette Newspaper.
CLOSE - Classifieds section of the Newspaper. In the bottom
right corner, in small print:
CLOSER - Ku Klux Klan - For Information, Contact 745-1209
Ron thinks a moment. Then grabs the phone. Dials.
After a few Rings, a Pre-Recorded Message Pops On:
_PRE-RECORDED MESSAGE
"You have reached The Colorado State Chapter of The Ku Klux Klan. Please leave a message... God Bless White America."
There's a BEEP...

"Did I just hear you use your Real Name?"
_RON STALLWORTH
"Motherfucker!!!"
_JIMMY
"Yeah, Motherfuckin' Amateur Hour. What were you thinkin'?"
RING!!! RING!!! Ron's Phone. Flip and Ron stare at it. Flip
gestures to answer it.
_RON STALLWORTH
"I wasn't."
_FLIP
"You dialed. Pick it up."
RING! RING! Ron looks at the ringing phone.
_FLIP (CONT'D)
"PICK IT UP!!!"
_RON STALLWORTH
"This is Ron Stallworth."
Through the Receiver, a Gravelly, Secretive Voice.
_WALTER BREACHWAY (O.S.)
"This is Walter. Returning your call... From The Organization."
_RON STALLWORTH
"The Organization?"
_WALTER BREACHWAY(O.S.)
"Yes. Well we appreciate your interest. So what is your Story, Ron?"
Ron looks around. Shrugs. Might as well do it...
_RON STALLWORTH
"Since you asked- I Hate Niggers, Jews, Mexicans, Spics, Chinks but especially those Niggers and anyone else that does not have pure White Aryan Blood running through their Veins."
All Heads in the Unit turn toward Ron.
_RON STALLWORTH (CONT'D)
"In fact, my Sister, Pamela, was recently accosted by a Nigger..."
Ron is snarling now, every ounce of his Voice projecting
White Supremacist Hate. He is utterly convincing.
_WALTER BREACHWAY (O.S.)
"...Is that so?"
_RON STALLWORTH
"...Every time I think about that Black Baboon putting his Filthy Black Hands on her White as Pure Driven Snow Body I wanna Puke!!!"
Silence on the other end of The Line.
_WALTER BREACHWAY(O.S.)
"You're just the kind of Guy we're looking for. Ron, when can we meet?"
Flip, Jimmy and all the other White Undercover Cops are
Rolling their Eyes. Stepping away, shaking their heads. Some
wanting to laugh but DON'T.
_RON STALLWORTH
"How about Friday night? After I get off work?"
The other Cops are losing their minds, Quietly.
_WALTER BREACHWAY(O.S.)
"Deal! I'll get back to you with details. Take care, Buddy Boy."
_RON STALLWORTH
"Looking forward to meeting you."
Ron looks around. Everyone in the Unit is standing around his
desk. All White Faces. Looking on, astonished.
_FLIP
"Good Luck Ron with your New Redneck Friend."
The Undercover Gang Cracks Up!

Ron is facing Sergeant Trapp, who sits at his desk, Jaw hung
slightly open.
_SGT. TRAPP
"They want you to join The Klan?"
_RON STALLWORTH
"Well... they want to meet me First."
_SGT. TRAPP
"They want to meet you?"
_RON STALLWORTH
"I'll need another Undercover to go in my place."
_SGT. TRAPP
"Yeah... you probably shouldn't go to that meeting."
_RON STALLWORTH
"You think?"
Everyone has a Chuckle.
_SGT. TRAPP
"We'd have to go to Narcotics. Meaning we'd have to deal with Bridges."
_RON STALLWORTH
"Damn. OMITTED"

"I can't spare any Men."
_SGT. TRAPP
"I've looked over the Logs and it seems you can spare them."
_CHIEF BRIDGES
"Sgt. Trapp, Ron spoke to the Man on the phone. When they hear the Voice of one of my Guys, they'll know the difference."
_RON STALLWORTH
"Why so, Chief?"
_CHIEF BRIDGES
"Want me to spell it out? He'll know the difference between how a White Man talks and a Negro."
_RON STALLWORTH
"What does a Black Man talk like?"
Silence.
_SGT. TRAPP
"Ron, I think what The Chief is trying to say is..."
_RON STALLWORTH
"...If you don't mind, I'd like to talk for myself, Thank You. How exactly does a Black Man talk?"
_CHIEF BRIDGES
"You know... YOU KNOW!!!"
_RON STALLWORTH
"Chief, some of us can speak King's English and Jive. I happen to be fluent in both."
_CHIEF BRIDGES
"Ron, how do you propose to make this Investigation?"
_RON STALLWORTH
"I have established contact and created some familiarity with The Klansmen over the phone. I will continue that role but another Officer, a White Officer, will play Me when they meet Face to Face."
_CHIEF BRIDGES
"...My Point Exactly!!!..."
Ron continues talking to Chief Bridges.
_RON STALLWORTH
"Black Ron Stallworth on The phone and White Ron Stallworth Face to Face, so there becomes a combined Ron Stallworth."
_CHIEF BRIDGES
"Can you do that?"
_RON STALLWORTH
"I believe we can... With The Right White Man."
INT. HALLWAY - CSPD - DAY
Ron steps outside and Chief BRIDGES follows him.

Ron walks in on Flip and Jimmy looking at him.
_FLIP
"You're late."
_RON STALLWORTH
"I'm sorry. It won't happen again."
_JIMMY
"I heard that somewhere before."
_FLIP
"Hey, Jimmy when's the last time they let a Rookie head up an Investigation. Oh that's right, NEVER."
Ron ignores the slight.
_RON STALLWORTH
Can we move on to the Bio, please.
_FLIP
"... Ron Stallworth. I do Wholesale Manufacturing."
_RON STALLWORTH
"Whereabout?"
Flip sighs.
_FLIP
"Pueblo."
_JIMMY
"What's that commute like?"
_FLIP
"Jimmy, I'm glad you asked, straight- shot down I-25. Hour tops."
_JIMMY
"Long ride."
_FLIP
"What do we listen to?"
_RON STALLWORTH
"KWYD. Christian Talk in The Morning, although the Signal starts to cut out near Pueblo. On the way back I go for 102.7 to get my Allman Brothers Fix. Only I have to change every time that British Fag David Bowie pipes on."
_JIMMY
"I love Bowie."
_RON STALLWORTH
"Remember you've got to retain the details of what you share with them so I can be White Ron Stallworth."
_FLIP
"Jimmy, I always wanted to grow up to be Black, all my Heroes were Black Guys. Willie Mays..."
_JIMMY
"Basket catch."
_FLIP
"Wilt The Stilt..."
_JIMMY
"A record hundred points in the game."
_FLIP
But my favorite is O.J.
_JIMMY
Love Fuckin' O.J. Orenthal James
Simpson.
_RON STALLWORTH
Well, don't share your Love of The
Brothers with these Guys. For you,
it's The Osmonds.
_FLIP
I get to play you but you don't get
to play me. Jimmy, does that sound
fair?
_JIMMY
Not to me.
_RON STALLWORTH
"Fair? I get to play you and Jimmy and all the other guys in the Station... Everyday."
Flip doesn't understand, he looks at Jimmy. Both befuddled.
_RON STALLWORTH (CONT'D)
"Who are you meeting?"
_FLIP
"Walter Breachway."
_RON STALLWORTH
"Become Walter's Friend, get invited back."
_FLIP
"Look at you. Is that it, Sir?"

_FLIP
"...And..."
_RON STALLWORTH
"...And you need to sound like my voice."

"Ron Stallworth?"
_FLIP
"That's me. And you must be Walter."
_FELIX
"Name's Felix."
_FLIP
"I was told I'd be meeting with Walter Breachway."
_FELIX
"Change of plans, Mack. I'm gonna need you to hop in The Pickup."
Even with his slouched shoulders, Felix towers over Flip.
_FLIP
"Okay, well how about I just follow you..."

"...No Can Do. You come with me. Security."

_FELIX
"You for The White Race, Ron?"

"Makes me Sick."

_FELIX
"Da Fuck did you say?"
_FLIP
"Camaraderie...?"
_FELIX
"No. The other word."
_FLIP
"The Klan...?"
_FELIX
"...Not "The Klan." It's The Organization. The Invisible Empire has managed to stay Invisible for a reason. Do Not Ever Use That Word. You understand?"
_FLIP
"I overstand... Right. The Organization."
An uncomfortable silence. Felix leers into the Rear-View
mirror.
_FELIX
"Check this Shit out... you're never gonna believe it."
_FLIP
"What?"
_FELIX
"There's a Jig on our Bumper."
Flip Freezes.

One hand on The Steering Wheel, Felix opens The Glove
compartment in front of Flip's knees and grabs a Box of
Ammunition.
_FELIX
"Let's be ready, case we gotta go and shoot us A Alabama Porch Monkey."
He tosses The Box onto Flip's lap.
_FELIX (CONT'D)
"Look under your seat. Pull it out."
_FLIP
"Pull out what?"
Felix snaps his finger at Flip, who jumps.
_FELIX
"Under the seat!!!"
Flip reaches to his Feet. Pulls out a SAWED-OFF SHOTGUN.
_FELIX (CONT'D)
"Load 'er up. One in The Chamber."
Flip is hesitant.
_FELIX (CONT'D)
"Load it!!!"
Flip dutifully opens up The Box. Pulls out a Shell. Loads it
into The Chamber and pulls the action forward.
_FLIP
"Ready to go."
Felix eyes The Rear-View Mirror again. Ron's Car has drifted
much farther back. Felix puffs away at his Cigarette.
_FELIX
"That's right, Porch Monkey. Don't be Messin' with us..."
_FLIP
"...The Organization."
_FELIX
"Not so fast, Buddy Boy."

_JIMMY
"Probably."
INT. CORNER POCKET LOUNGE - NIGHT
A Cramped and Unfriendly Dive. LOW-LIFES mill about. The Air
filled with Dense Smoke. Pool Balls CRACK-SMACK.
Felix leads Flip to The Bar Area, where WALTER BREACHWAY,
White Male, 30's, stands. Walter is affable by nature, Short
and Stocky, with a Crew Cut and small Mustache.
_WALTER
"Ron. Glad you could make it. Walter Breachway, Chapter President."
They shake hands.
_FLIP
"I appreciate you inviting me out."
Felix lingers like a Bad Smell. Beside him a Drunk Man,
IVANHOE 20's, gives Flip The Stink Eye.
_WALTER
"I've been impressed with our phone conversations. I feel you have some fine ideas that could help The Cause."
_FLIP
"I meant every word I said."
Flip's a Natural.
_WALTER
"How 'bout some pool?"
Ivanhoe hands Flip a Pool Stick and gathers the Balls.
_WALTER (CONT'D)
"I've had my own share of Run-Ins with Niggers. Matter of fact, it's part of what led me to The Organization."
_FLIP
"That right?"
_WALTER
"It became my salvation. After I was shot and wounded by some Niggers. My Wife... Savagely Raped by a whole Pack of 'EM, and not a one went to Jail."
Flip nods, expertly feigning sympathy.

_ALL
"NIGGERS!!!"
_FLIP
"I been saying this stuff for years."
_FELIX
"You ain't the only one."
_FLIP
"You don't know how good it is to hear someone that gets it."
Flip looks around. Gets quiet.
_FLIP (CONT'D)
"What kinda stuff you Guys do?"
Ivanhoe swigs his Beer.
_IVANHOE
"You know, Cross burnings. Marches and stuff so people don't Fuck wit' us."
_FLIP
"I'm tired of people Fuckin' with me."
_WALTER
"You come to the right place cuz' Nobody Fucks with us. How much you know about The History?"
_FLIP
"Some...I could know more."
_WALTER
"We'll teach you."
_IVANHOE
"This year's gonna be big for us."
_FLIP
"How so?"
Ivanhoe moves in closer. Balls his hand in a fist, then opens
it quickly.
_IVANHOE
"BOOM!!! We're gonna make Fireworks, yes we are..."
Walter swoops in.
_WALTER
"...Ivanhoe talking nonsense again. Kid can't hold his Beer fer Shit. The Organization is strictly Non- Violent..."
_IVANHOE" ...Like dat Dead Nigger Martin Luther Coon."
_FLIP
"Gotcha."
Flip looks down at his Shirt -- the Top Button has flapped
off again. The next button would mean The End. CURTAINS.
He quickly buttons it. Then...
_WALTER
"Say, Ron? Mind coming with me?"
_FLIP
"Where to?"
_FELIX
"You Undercover or something? You ask too many questions. Let's GO!!!"
Behind Walter, Felix is Laser-Focused on Flip's every move.
Flip sees it. Walter points to a door. Flip walks forward,
with Walter, Ivanhoe, and Felix tailing from behind.

_JIMMY
"Where they going?"
Ron's Face falls.

"Lost the damn signal."

The Men move single-file through the door, Flip first. It's a
small room, with a wooden table and some rickety chairs. A
lone white light bulb hangs from above.
_WALTER
"Congrats you passed The Mustard."
Walter exchanges uneasy looks with Felix.
_WALTER (CONT'D)
"Thought we'd get the Membership process started."
Flip can breathe again.
_FLIP
"Now we're talkin'."
Walter hands Flip a stack of papers.
_WALTER
"Fill these out and Mail 'em to The National Headquarters. Once they send your Membership Card, you'll be able to participate in our Programs."
Flip sings The Alcoa Jingle.
_FLIP
"Alcoa Can't wait."
_IVANHOE
"I like those Commercials."
_WALTER
"Imperial Tax to become a Member: Ten Dollars for The Year. Fifteen Dollar Chapter Fee. Robes and Hoods not included, that's Extra."
_FELIX
"Fuckin' Inflation."
Flip shakes hands with all.
_FLIP
"I can't thank you Brothers enough."
_WALTER
"Pleasure, is all ours."
Felix and Ivanhoe give polite nods.
_WALTER (CONT'D)
"I'll take you back to your Car."
As Flip turns to leave...
_FELIX
"You're not a Jew, right?"
Flip stops.
_FLIP
"You trying to offend me?"
Flip turns to Walter: you believe this Shit?
_FELIX
"It's Protocol."
All eyes on Flip. His face flares with rage.
_FLIP
"'Course I'm no Stinkin' Kike."
_WALTER
"We gotta ask it, is all. I'm satisfied. How about you Guys?"
Ivanhoe nods. Felix just stares.
_FELIX
"Smells Kosher to me."
_FLIP
"Stop fuckin' 'round."
_WALTER
"Felix, cut it out."

Ron helps Flip rip The Wire off his Chest.
_FLIP
"You have me dressed like one of the Beverly Hillbillies for Chrissakes. I felt too Redneck for those Guys."
_RON STALLWORTH
"They liked you."
_FLIP
"Except for that Felix Guy. Do not ride his Bumper like that! Two car lengths!"
_RON STALLWORTH
"You got The Papers? They want you to join."
_FLIP
"Technically they want you to join."
_RON STALLWORTH
"They want a Black Man to join The Ku Klux Klan. I'd call that Mission Impossible. Double Success."
INT. SERGEANT TRAPP'S OFFICE - CSPD - DAY
Sgt. Trapp sits at his desk, thumbing through The Report. Ron
and Flip stand across from him.
_SGT. TRAPP
"And exactly how much should we be worrying about them?"
_RON STALLWORTH
"Enough that we'd like to dig deeper. One of the Men discussed plans for a possible Attack..."
_FLIP
"...I wouldn't give him that much credit. These Yahoos like to Boast."
_SGT. TRAPP
"What kind of Attack?"
Ron looks to Flip.
_FLIP
"Ivanhoe said "BOOM", mentioned something about Fireworks. Personally, I didn't buy it. Doubt they're even capable."
Sgt. Trapp bridges his hands together, contemplating.
_RON STALLWORTH
"Either way, we're looking for full support from The Department."
_SGT. TRAPP
"We're moving on with the Investigation."
Ron just stares at Trapp.
INT. ITALIAN BISTRO - NIGHT
Ron and Patrice seated across from each other, already

Leather Jacket.
_PATRICE
"The next day when we dropped Brother Kwame off at the Airport he told me The Black Power Movement needed Strong Sistah's like me to lead the fight against Capitalist oppression and The Politicians and Pigs who perpetuate it. His words almost made that whole Pig Nightmare worth while..."
Ron goes Mute.
_PATRICE (CONT'D)
"...What's wrong?"
_RON STALLWORTH
"I don't really use that word."
_PATRICE
"What word?"
_RON STALLWORTH
"Pigs."
_PATRICE
"What else would you call them?"
_RON STALLWORTH
"Cops... Police..."
_PATRICE
"Bunch of Racist Cops on a Power Trip."
_RON STALLWORTH
"So you think all Cops are Racist?"
_PATRICE
"It only takes One to pull a Trigger on a Innocent Sister or Brother."
Patrice absorbs all of this.
_PATRICE (CONT'D)
"Why were you at Brother Kwame's Speech?"
_RON STALLWORTH
"He's got some good ideas. I don't agree with all of them but he's a smart Brother who's worth hearing."
_PATRICE
"Are you Down for The Liberation of Black People?"
_RON STALLWORTH
"Do we always have to talk about Politics?"
_PATRICE
"What's more important?"
_RON STALLWORTH
"Do you ever take any time off from The Liberation of Black People?"
_PATRICE
"NO!!! It's a Lifetime JOB!!!"
Ron reaches across the table and takes Patrice's Hand.
Patrice pulls her Hand back.
_RON STALLWORTH (CONT'D)
"Sista Angela Davis, can we spend some quality time together."
_PATRICE
"And what did you say your J-O-B is?"
_RON STALLWORTH
"Kathleen Cleaver, I didn't?"
_PATRICE
"Are You A Pig?"
_RON STALLWORTH
"You mean A Cop?"
_PATRICE
"You A Cop?"
_RON STALLWORTH
"NO I'm a Black Man who wants to get to know A Strong, Intelligent, Beautiful Sister."
Ron tries to kiss Patrice but she moves her head away. They
finish their meal in silence.

Suddenly... The Undercover Line rings. Ron freezes. Picks up
the line.
_RON STALLWORTH
"This is Ron."
_WALTER (O.S.)
"This is Walter. Is this Ron? Your Voice sounds different over The Phone."
Ron has to THINK FAST.
_RON STALLWORTH
"Allergies acting up again."
A steady Beat of Silence on The Line. Then...
_WALTER (O.S.)
"...Yeah, I get that all the time."
Ron waits for the response.
_WALTER (O.S.)(CONT'D)
"Well, just thought I'd say it was great having you swing by. The Brothers really took a liking to you."
Ron squeezes his fist. Victory. Trying to stay nonchalant:
_RON STALLWORTH
"I'm honored."
_WALTER (O.S.)
"Why don't you come by Felix's this Saturday? Meet the rest of The Brotherhood."
INT.CSPD HALLWAY - DAY
Sgt. Trapp and Ron walk and talk.
_SGT. TRAPP
"I've got a friend that's up with these Groups. He says they're moving away from the Ole Violent Racist Style. That's what Davis is peddling now, it's become Mainstream."
_RON STALLWORTH
"Davis?"
_SGT. TRAPP
"Devin Davis current Grand Wizard of The Klan, always in a three piece suit, he now goes by National Director. He's clearly got his Sights on Higher Office."
_RON STALLWORTH
"Political Office? How so?"
_SGT. TRAPP
"Yeah, I guess they're trying to move away from their History of Selling HATE..."
_RON STALLWORTH
"...Keep going."
_SGT. TRAPP
"Affirmative Action, Immigration, Crime, Tax Reform. He said no one wants to be called a Bigot anymore. Archie Bunker made that too Un-Cool. The idea is under all these issues, everyday Americans can accept it, support it, until eventually, one day, you get somebody in The White House that embodies it."
_RON STALLWORTH
"America would never elect somebody like Devin Davis President of the United States of America?"
Sgt. Trapp just stares at Ron for a long moment.
_SGT. TRAPP
"For a so called Black Man, you're pretty naive."

Thanks Honey.
Felix turns to The Brothers. Klansmen Feed off The Energy.
_FELIX
"Make 'em remember who We Are and What We Stand For. We are The Organization."
_CONNIE
"I read in The Gazette some Nigger named Carmichael held a Rally and there's some College Nigger Girl with the "Baboon Student Union" attacking Our Police. This Girl is Dangerous. Reminds me of that Commie Angela Davis. We need to shut her damn mouth."
The Men exchange uneasy looks - Why is Connie in Men's
Business?
_CONNIE (CONT'D)
"Here, I clipped the Article."
Connie pulls The Article from her apron. Hands it to Felix.
Felix eyes it, focused on an image of Kwame and without
looking up...
_FELIX
"That'll be all. Love you Sweetie."
_CONNIE
"One of these days you're going to need me to do something for you. Wait and See."
Connie trudges back towards the house without answering.
Felix hands The Clipping to The Klansmen, who pass it around
the room. When it reaches Walter, he sets it down.
_WALTER
"How 'bout We focus on our Bread and Butter. The Next Cross Burning. Which, Flip, you'll be lucky enough to participate in if your Membership Card comes soon enough..."
_FLIP
"...That'd be a tremendous Honor. Where?"
_WALTER
"The Highest Hills get the most Eyes."
Walter looks for approval. Nods all around. Felix rises, his
balance uncertain.
_FELIX
"Hey Ron, I gotta show you something."
Felix plops a Hand on Flip's Back. Flip rises.

"Here's my favorite. Twelve Gauge."
Felix smirks and points The Two Barrels at Flip's chest.
_FELIX (CONT'D)
"I call this...The Jew Killer."
Flip Freezes. Felix's Finger Rests on The Trigger. Teasingly?
Seriously? Felix stares, challenging Flip to make a Move. Any
Move.
_FLIP
"That's a Remington Model 1900."
A long Beat. Then: Felix smiles.
_FELIX
"Indeed it is."
Felix places the Shotgun back on the rack. Walter outside The
Door.
_WALTER (O.S.)
"Almost done in here? We still have some items on The Agenda..."
_FELIX

Flip keeps quiet.
ANGLE - HALLWAY
_WALTER
"Come on Man, this is just Straight-Up Offensive. We're talking about someone who's gonna be our Brother in a couple months. Is there a fuckin' Star of David around his Neck? Does Ron got a YA-MA-KA on his HEAD for Pete's sake?"
_FELIX (O.S.)
"Just Protocol. My House, My Rules."

Felix sets Flip down on a chair.

"Felix, it ain't necessary, Man. This is how we lose recruits!"
Felix pushes Walter backward, through and out The Den door.
He slams The Door closed and locks it.
_FLIP
"What is this your Jew Den? This where you make your Candles? Lamp shades?"
Felix opens a Desk Drawer and takes out a POLYGRAPH MACHINE.
_FELIX
"No, you're going to take this Lie Detector test."

"Open up, Felix! Enough is Enough!!!"
_FELIX
"Lower your Arm right here."
_FLIP
"Felix, this is lame bullshit."
_FELIX
"Lame or not you're taking this Jew Lie Detector Test."
Felix reaches in and lowers his Arm for him, then slides the
Blood Pressure cuff over Flip's Arm. Flip rips it off, jumps
up, knocking the chair over.
_FLIP
"Out of respect, I'm gonna play along with your Get Smart Bullshit, but I'm No Fuckin' Jew!!!"
Walter persistently bangs on The Door. Felix pulls out a
Shiny Pistol from his belt.

Flip sits in The Chair as Felix sticks Electrodermal Sensors
on Flip's hands.

"Ask anybody, they'll say I'm a real Friendly Guy. Thing is, I'm only Friendly to my Friends, not JEW Friendly, Damn Sure not Nigger Friendly."
Walter is still banging away at the door.
_WALTER(O.S.)
"Let me in!"
Felix tightens The Blood Pressure Cuff on Flip's arm.
_FELIX
"Let's warm up. What is the surname of your Biological Father?"
_FLIP
"Stallworth."
_FELIX
"Let me see your Dick."
Flip starts to unzip his pants and smiles.
_FLIP
"You like pretty Dicks Felix?"
_FELIX
"I hear you Jews do something Funny with ya Dicks. Some weird Jew Shit. Is your Dick circumstanced?"
_FLIP
"You tryin' to suck my Jew Dick? Faggot."
_FELIX
"Who you callin' a Faggot, Jew?"
_FELIX
"Y'know what I think?"
_FLIP
"You think?"
_FELIX
"I think a lot."
_FLIP
"What do you think about?"
_FELIX
"I think this Holocaust stuff never happened."
_FLIP
"What?"
_FELIX
"That's the biggest Jewish Conspiracy. 8 Million Jews killed? Concentration camps? Never happened. Where's the proof?"
CLOSE - FLIP
WE SEE on Flip's face, despite him trying to fight hard to be
affected, he is not that good an Actor. Marlon Brando
couldn't do it either.
_FLIP
"Are you High?"
_FELIX
"I don't get High. I drink."
_FLIP
"Haven't seen the Footage."
_FELIX
"Fake. Jews run Hollywood."

Missing on purpose just as Ron reaches The Unmarked car. Ron
jumps inside... SQUEEEEEL! The Car peels off.
_FLIP
"Yeah, keep drivin' you Black Spearchucker!!! Piece a Shit Nigger!!!"
_FELIX
"Almost got 'im."
Flip is Foaming at The Mouth. Everyone stares at him,
momentarily surprised at his outburst. Flip hands Felix his
Gun back.
_FLIP
"Felix, you still want me to take your Jew Detector Test!!!"
Walter looks from Flip to Felix. Felix can only shrug.

"And he didn't."
_FLIP
"But he could have and then I woulda been Dead... for what? Stoppin' some Jerkoffs from playing Dress up?"
_RON STALLWORTH
"Flip, it's Intel."
_FLIP
"I'm not risking my Life to prevent some Rednecks from lighting a couple Sticks on Fire."
_RON STALLWORTH
"This is the Job. What's your problem?"
_FLIP
"Ron, you're my problem."
_RON STALLWORTH
"How's that?"
_FLIP
"For you it's not a job, it's a Crusade. It's not personal nor should it be."
They stop walking.
_RON STALLWORTH
Why haven't you bought into this?
_FLIP
Why should I?
_RON STALLWORTH
Because you're Jewish, Brother. The
So-Called Chosen People.
Flip gets pissed and flies up into Ron face. They are nose to

_RON STALLWORTH (CONT'D)
"You're passing, Man."
_FLIP
"What?"
_RON STALLWORTH
"You're passing for a WASP!!! White Anglo Saxon Protestant, All-American Hot Dog, Cherry Pie White Boy. It's what some Light-Skinned Black Folks do, they pass for White."
Flip understands now. He glares at Ron.
_RON STALLWORTH (CONT'D)
"Doesn't that Hatred The Klan say Piss you off."
_FLIP
"Of course it does."

_RON STALLWORTH
"Good afternoon. My name is Ron Stallworth, calling from Colorado Springs. How are you today, Sir?"

"Really? National Director too?"
_DEVIN DAVIS(O.S.)
"Really."

_DEVIN DAVIS
"And I'm just happy to be talking to a True White American."
INTERCUT RON WITH DEVIN DAVIS:
_RON STALLWORTH
"Amen, Mr. Davis. Seems like there's less and less of us these days. Now about that Membership Card..."
Davis unwraps a stick of Juicy Fruit Gum, his favorite.
_DEVIN DAVIS
"...I understand the situation. We've been having some Administrative problems that have caused a backlog. ...Tell you what, Ron. I'll see to it personally that your Membership Card is processed and sent out today."
_RON
"Thank you, Mr. Davis. I can't express to you how much I appreciate this."
_DEVIN DAVIS
"The pleasure is all mine. I look forward to meeting you in person One Day and God Bless White America."
INT. CSPD - DAY
Ron rushes out of the room buzzing about speaking to Davis he
immediately KNOCKS shoulders with someone going the other
way. When he turns around it's... Master Patrolman Landers,
who turns back giving a smirk.

"Watch where you're going. You could get hurt like that Hot Shot."
Landers marches on leaving Ron to contemplate.
INT. INTELLIGENCE UNIT - CSPD - DAY

"That Cop that pulled Kwame Ture over that night... was it Landers?"

"How'd you know?"

Flip ponders for a moment, then says.
_FLIP
"He's been a Bad Cop for a long time."
_RON STALLWORTH
"Yeah?"
_FLIP
"Does that kinda' Shit all the time. Few years ago, he allegedly Shot and Killed a Black Kid... he said he had a Gun. The Kid wasn't the type."
_RON STALLWORTH
"Flip, why do you tolerate this?"
_FLIP
"We're a family. Good or Bad. We stick together. You wanna be the Guy that Rats him out?"
Ron goes quiet.
_FLIP (CONT'D)
"You're New. You're a Rookie. You ever get your Ass in a Jam, you'll appreciate The Blue Wall of Silence."
_RON STALLWORTH
"Yeah, reminds me of another Group."
Ron finished. Flip steps away buttoning his shirt.

Nearby, a couple of fold-up tables stocked with plates of
Grilled Meat and Bowls of Cheese Doodles. Flip is locked in
conversation with Walter, who could not care less about the
Firing Range behind him.
_WALTER
"... and then you got what used to be a decent Bar, The Hide N Seek Room, turned into a Filthy Fag Bar overnight."
_FLIP
"Fuckin' Fags everywhere these days."
Flip is still mostly focused on Felix and his crew.
_WALTER
"They're trying to Colonize. First they get their own Bars, then they want Equal Treatment..."
_FLIP
"...Forget Dem Fags... Some of these Guys Army-trained?"
Walter turns around for a moment, then turns back,
dismissive.
_WALTER
"A lot of 'em are. Fort Carson..."

 Butt, Body.
_FELIX (CONT'D)
"I don't know how that Black Bastard got away the other day."
 Ivanhoe suddenly pipes up.
_IVANHOE
"Hey, Ron! Take my Forty-Five Auto wanna see what you can do."
_FELIX
"Maybe you'll get dat Nigger next time."
 Ivanhoe hands Flip his pistol. He takes it, his hand sweaty.

"Cleopatra Jones was the one. It's about time We see a strong Sister like that..."
_RON STALLWORTH
"...And Tamara Dobson played a Cop."
_PATRICE
"That was a Black Exploitation Movie. A fantasy. Real life's not like that. In real life there's no Cleopatra Jones or Coffy."
_RON STALLWORTH
"You don't dig Pam Grier? She's Fine as Wine and twice as Mellow."
_PATRICE
"Pam Grier is doing her Thing but in real life it's just Pigs killing Black Folks."
_RON STALLWORTH
"What if a Cop was trying to make things better."
_PATRICE
"From the inside?"
_RON STALLWORTH
"Yeah, from the inside."
_PATRICE
"You can't make things better from the inside. It's a Racist System."
_RON STALLWORTH
"So just give up?"
_PATRICE
"No!!! We fight for what Black People really need! BLACK LIBERATION!!!"
_RON STALLWORTH
"Can't you do that from the inside!"
_PATRICE
"No! You can't. White Man won't let us."
Ron gets frustrated. Patrice stops him.
_PATRICE (CONT'D)
"What did Dubois say about "Double Consciousness"? "Twoness". Being an American and a Negro? Two Souls? Two Thoughts? Two warring ideals in one Dark Body?"
_RON STALLWORTH
"I know how that feels. I'm Two damn people all the time!"
_PATRICE
"But you shouldn't be! We shouldn't have a War going on inside ourselves. Why can't we just be Black People?"
_RON STALLWORTH
"Because we're not there yet!"
_PATRICE
"Well, I'm tired of waiting!"
Patrice walks off. Ron sighs, walks to catch up to her, and
puts his arm around Patrice.
_RON STALLWORTH
"Shaft or Superfly?"
_PATRICE
"What?"
_RON STALLWORTH
"Pick one, Shaft or Superfly?"
_PATRICE
"A Private Detective over a Pimp any day and twice on Sundays."
_RON STALLWORTH
"Richard Roundtree or Ron O'Neal?"
_PATRICE
"Richard Roundtree. Pimps Ain't No Heroes."
_RON STALLWORTH
"Ron O'Neal isn't a Pimp. He's just playing one."

"You got a Twin."
_FLIP
"Twin what?"

_FELIX (CONT'D)
"Looked in the Phone Book and went over what I thought was your place and found a Nig there."
Felix looks deadly. Ivanhoe and Walter look at Flip. Finally.
_FLIP
"My number's unlisted."
Felix just continues to stare.
_FLIP (CONT'D)
"What address did you go to?"
_FELIX
"Over on... Bluestem Lane."
_FLIP
"I don't live on Bluestem. I live off 21st Street..."

"You're right, I'm messin' up. Hate to violate that Blue Wall of Silence."
_FLIP
"Nice one."
_RON STALLWORTH
"Is Patrice a Target?"
_FLIP
"Maybe."
Ron goes quiet, concerned.

"Oh Hell yeah!!!"
Ron SLAPS The Large Photo of Devin Davis.

_RON STALLWORTH
"I called to warn you, but you must have already taken off."
_FLIP
"Ron, I wasn't raised Jewish. It wasn't a part of my Life. So I never thought much about being Jewish, was just another White Kid, didn't even have my Bar Mitzvah. No Chanukah for me. Christmas. In this job, you try to keep things at a distance. You put up a Shield so you don't feel anything... This shit is deep. When that Fuck Felix had me in that room and I kept having to deny my heritage...I have been passing. OMITTED."
"OMITTED."

"You've been outspoken about the incident with the Police when Brother Kwame was here."
_PATRICE
"So the next time they'll have a Burning Cross out Front."
_RON STALLWORTH
"They're trying to get to you, like you said they want to intimidate make themselves feared. If you don't let 'em scare you. They got nothing. But keep your eyes open. Be Cool."
_ODETTA
"That's the problem we've been too Cool!"
_HAKEEM
"Way too Cool!"
_RON STALLWORTH
"Maybe the both of you should call The Cops."
_HAKEEM
"How we know this ain't some of the KKK's Honky-Pig-Partners passing out this Shit!"
Patrice and Ron step away from Odetta and Hakeem. They walk
and talk.

"Soak the Wood in Kerosene, we light a Cig on a pack of matches. Gives us time to Beat It before The Cross catches Fire. Safeguard against CSPD."
_FLIP
"Must be quite a sight."
_IVANHOE
"The Best. You can see it for Miles. Freaks out The Jew Media and puts Niggers on their Nigger Toes."
They ride in silence for a moment.
_FLIP
"A lot of these Guys in The Army?"
_IVANHOE
"Yeah, even got a few in Active Duty."
_FLIP
"Just finished my Second Tour in Nam."
Ivanhoe's eyes light up.
_IVANHOE
"Oh yeah? Know anything about C-4?"
_FLIP
"Enough to make shit BLOW UP."
 Flip stops talking. He might've revealed a bit too much.

 EXT. OPPOSITE HILLSIDE - NIGHT

96INT. RON'S DESK - CSPD INTELLIGENCE UNIT - NIGHT
It's late. Ron's alone on the phone in mid-conversation. It
is intercut with Devin Davis speaking on the sofa in his
"OFFICE:"
_DEVIN DAVIS
"...I don't share this with many people, but My family had a Colored Housekeeper growing up. Her name was Pinky. She was probably the closest Woman to me other than Mother."
_RON STALLWORTH
"That surprises me."
_DEVIN DAVIS
"I know. People think I hate Negroes. I don't and The Organization doesn't either."
Ron gives a "This Is Crazy!" Look.
_DEVIN DAVIS
"They just need to be with their own. That's what Pinky would say, she had no problem with Segregation because she wanted to be with her own kind."
_RON STALLWORTH
"Sounds like she was a Mammy to you."
_DEVIN DAVIS
"She was. You ever see "Gone with the Wind"? Pinky was my Hattie McDaniel. She won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress."
_RON STALLWORTH
"You were Scarlett and she was Mammy."
_DEVIN DAVIS
"That's right. When she passed away it was like we lost one of the Family."
_RON STALLWORTH
"A good Nigger's funny that way. In that sense they're like a Dog. They can get real close to you and when you lose em'. Just breaks your heart."
_DEVIN DAVIS
"Well said Ron."
_RON STALLWORTH
"I knew a Nigger once."
_DEVIN DAVIS
"Didja?"
_RON STALLWORTH
"Yeah. Nigger lived across the street from us. I must of been Six or Seven. His nickname was Butter Biscuit."
_DEVIN DAVIS
"How'd he get that nickname?"
_RON STALLWORTH
"He loved his Mama's Butter Biscuits."
_DEVIN DAVIS
"Yum Yum!!!"
_RON STALLWORTH
"Me and Butter Biscuit played together everyday. One day My Father came home early from work and told me I couldn't play with him anymore because I was White and Butter Biscuit was a Nigger."
INT. DEVIN DAVIS'S OFFICE - NIGHT
Davis laughs.
_DEVIN DAVIS
"That's rich."
Ron's face reveals the story is probably true, but reversed.
_RON STALLWORTH
"Ain't it."
_DEVIN DAVIS
"Your Father sounds like a Terrific Man."
_RON STALLWORTH
"Thanks, Buddy."
_DEVIN DAVIS
"Well, you're an upstanding White Christian Man. I tell you this is why we need more people like us in Public Office. To get this Country back on Track."
_RON STALLWORTH
"Amen."
_DEVIN DAVIS
"For America to Achieve our Greatness... again."
_RON STALLWORTH
"Absolutely. Sure wish we had the chance to chat Face to Face."
_DEVIN DAVIS
"In due time, my friend, in due time. I'll be in Colorado Springs for your initiation..."
_RON STALLWORTH
"You'll be in Colorado Springs?"
_DEVIN DAVIS
"You bet your Mayflower Society Ass I will."
Ron smiles and takes a SMALL NOTE PAD from his jacket pocket
and writes something down.

_Cherry Revision 77.
_WALTER (O.S.) (CONT'D)
"It should be you, Ron. You should be Chapter President. You!!!"
Ron sits there a moment, unable to say a word. After he
"COMPOSES HIMSELF:"
_RON STALLWORTH
"That would be quite an Honor."
_WALTER (O.S.)
"You will be Great..."
_RON STALLWORTH
"I'll have to think about this. My father is very ill and he lives in El Paso. I won't have the time."
_WALTER (O.S.)

handshake.
CLOSE - Index and Middle Finger extended along The Inside
Wrist.
_WALTER
"I think it's time for some new Blood to get in here. I'm planning to step down as your President."
Members exchanged looks. Felix can't hide his smile.
_WALTER (CONT'D)
"I'd like to make a nomination... Mr. Ron Stallworth for Chapter President."
The Room is Silent.
_FELIX
"We just met this Guy."
_IVANHOE
He just walked in off the street.
_FELIX
"Let me ask a question. Is there anybody here that is willing to put their Neck on the Line for Ron?"
_WALTER
"I will vouch for Ron."
All eyes turn to Flip.
_FLIP
"It's a Big Honor but I can't accept. Problem is, what you Good Men need is a President who will be constant, on CALL Day In, Day Out. I'll be back and forth between here and Dallas."
INT. UNMARKED CAR - NIGHT
Ron on headphones squints, WORRIED, saying to himself.
_RON STALLWORTH
"El Paso, Flip, El Paso..."
INT. FELIX'S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT
_WALTER
"Dallas? I thought it was El Paso."
The rest of the Chapter Members are paying attention now.
_FLIP
"Did I say Dallas?"
_WALTER
"You sure did."
_FELIX
"Ron which One is it?"
_IVANHOE
"Make up your mind."
The whole Room waits.
_FLIP
"Dallas is where my Plane layover is. El Paso is where my sick Father is."
They buy it. We think.
_IVANHOE
"Dallas, where they killed that Nigger Lover Kennedy."
_FELIX
"Where you learned that?"
_IVANHOE
"I can read."
The Chapter chatters in agreement.
_FLIP
"I just hope my Father isn't cared for by some Texicano Spic Nurse."
Collective moans.

"We'll pray for ya Pop's health."
_IVANHOE
"And Big Spic Teets!!!"
INT. CSPD INTELLIGENCE UNIT - RON'S DESK - DAY
Ron is on the Undercover Phone Line. Sgt. Trapp sits behind

"I'm anxious to meet you and it will be something I share with my Family for Generations to come."
103A INT. DEVIN DAVIS'S OFFICE - DEVIN'S DESK - DAY
INTERCUT RON AND SGT. TRAPP WITH DEVIN DAVIS AT HIS DESK:
_DEVIN DAVIS
"I'm eager to meet you too, Ron."
Ron and Sgt. Trapp make eye contact. Sgt. Trapp nods, a laugh
threatening to spring out of his Face.
_RON STALLWORTH
"Say, Mr. Davis... I just have to ask. Aren't you ever concerned about some Smart-Aleck Negro calling you and pretending to be White?"
Sgt. Trapp covers his Mouth.
_DEVIN DAVIS
"No, I can always tell when I'm talking to a Negro."
_RON STALLWORTH
"How so?"
_DEVIN DAVIS
"Take you, for example. I can tell you are a pure Aryan White Man by the way you pronounce certain words."
Sgt. Trapp is doubled over now.
_RON STALLWORTH
"Any examples?"
_DEVIN DAVIS
"Take the word "are". A pure Aryan like you or I would say it correctly... like "are". Negroes pronounce it "are-uh"."
_RON STALLWORTH
"You are so White... Right. I want to thank you for this Lesson because if you had not brought it to my attention, I would never have noticed the difference between how We talk and how Negroes talk."
Sgt. Trapp is laughing so hard he is shaking violently. He
shakes his head as if to implore Ron to stop.
_RON STALLWORTH (CONT'D)
"From now on I'm going to pay close attention to my Telephone conversations so I can make sure I'm not talking to one of dem' Sneaky Coloreds."
Ron cups The Receiver, looks at Sgt. Trapp, whispers.
_RON STALLWORTH (CONT'D)
"You okay?"
Sgt. Trapp gets up and bumbles away. Ron speaks into The
"PHONE:"
_RON STALLWORTH (CONT'D)
"I would love to continue this conversation when you are in Colorado Springs. Beautiful here, Sir. God's Country."
_DEVIN DAVIS
"That's what I've heard, Ron. You have a nice day."
_RON STALLWORTH
"You too, Sir. God Bless White America."
 Ron hangs up, laughing. He calls to Sgt. Trapp:
_RON STALLWORTH (CONT'D)
"It's over!!! You can come back!!!"
 INT. FELIX'S HOUSE - DAY
 Just then-- The Undercover Phone rings. Ron hesitates. It's
 strange timing. He picks up.
_RON STALLWORTH (CONT'D)
"Hello?"
_FELIX (O.S.)
"It's Felix."
 Ron quickly cups The Receiver.
_FELIX (O.S.)(CONT'D)
"Catch you at a bad time?"
_RON STALLWORTH
"Not at all. Just... finishing a Meal."
_FELIX (O.S.)
"Meeting. My House. Now. Git ya Ass in gear and don't tell Mealy Mouth Walter."

105INT. FELIX'S STORM SHELTER - DAY
 Flip enters The Short Stairwell, steps to The Cement Floor.
_FELIX (O.S.)
"Welcome to The Promised Land."
 The Room is Tight. Military Outfits hang from The Wall,
 surrounding The Group of Klansmen, who sit on Milk Crates. In
 the corner, a Sniper Rifle rests on a swivel near Boxes of
 Canned Goods and Stacked Cots.
 Flip finds an empty Crate, Squats.
 Felix stands underneath a single hanging Light-Bulb.
_FELIX (CONT'D)
"In about a week's time, we will be welcoming Mr. Davis to our City."
 Felix lets that hang in The Air for a moment.
_FELIX (CONT'D)
"Who's packing tonight?"
Ivanhoe goes upside his head with his handgun.
_IVANHOE
"I'm packed."
One by one, Brothers brandish Weapons. Except Flip.
_FELIX (CONT'D)
"Where's your Piece, Ron?"
_FLIP
"I don't carry it on me All The Time."
The Chapter Members laugh teasingly.
_FELIX
"I got ya covered."
_FLIP
"Won't happen again."
Felix reaches behind his back, pulls out a Sharpe & Gibson
.45 caliber and hands it to Flip.
_FELIX (CONT'D)
"We're gonna need your Good Shot come next Sunday."
_FLIP
"What's gonna happen next Sunday?"
A beat. Felix regards the rest of the Men with gravity.
_FELIX
"The War is gonna come to us."
_FLIP
"Fuck ya'."
Felix grins.
_IVANHOE
"Looks like we got ourselves another Soldier."
_FELIX
"Just make sure that when you're at The Steakhouse, you've got your new friend with Ya."
_IVANHOE
"And give it a name."

Felix and Connie are in bed, she is lying on his chest.
_CONNIE
Honey, you ever have second thoughts?
_FELIX
About what?
_CONNIE
Killin' 'em.
_FELIX
Never think twice about Killin'
Niggers.
_CONNIE
"Won't be able to take it back."
_FELIX
"They're da' first of many Niggers that must die, Honey Bun."
_CONNIE
"I know. It's just... becoming so real. It's always seemed like a dream."
Felix sits up, reflecting, proud and determined.
_FELIX
"I know. It's just so beautiful. We're cleansing this Country of a backwards Race of Monkey's. First the Spooks then the Kikes."
Felix sits up raising his hand like Martin Luther King.
_FELIX (CONT'D)
"Free at last! Free at Last! Thank God a'mighty - Free a' dem Niggers At Last!!!"
They chuckle.
_CONNIE
"I love when you do that, Honey."
Connie looks into his eyes, also reflective.
_CONNIE (CONT'D)
"You know, we've talked about killing Niggers for so many years and now it's really happening."
_FELIX
"My Old Man always told me good things come to those who wait."
She touches the side of his face, very loving.
_CONNIE
"Thank you for bringing me into you Life. For loving me like you do and giving me a purpose, direction."
_FELIX
"Y'know, this will be the Shot heard around The World."
_CONNIE
The New Boston Tea Party.
_FELIX
"Honey Bun, one day, The Great Historians will write about us like that. They'll say we were the Patriots that saved America. You and me. We turned the Tide. Saved our True White Race... it fact, saved an entire Nation and brought it back to its Glorious Destiny."
_CONNIE
"In a way, we're The New Founding Fathers."
 This strikes Felix. He sits there soaking it in. He finally
 turns to Connie.
_FELIX
"Yes we are... Martha."
_CONNIE
"Indeed we are... George."
 The Couple Kiss each other passionately.

 He sees something. On his Desk. A Simple Note:
 ACACIA PARK. 12 PM. BRING CASE BOOK. AGENT Y - FBI.
 EXT. OLD ABANDONED BREWSTER'S FACTORY - DAY
 Ron's Car is parked, and another Car drives up and parks
 across from him.

 suit.
_MAN(O.S.)
"Mr. Stallworth."
_RON STALLWORTH
"Agent... Y?"
EXT. OLD ABANDONED BREWSTER'S FACTORY - DAY
_AGENT Y
"Names of Chapter Members?"
Agent Y shows Ron a folder and runs his Finger down The List
and suddenly stops. He then continues going down The List,
then stops again. He pulls out a Small Ledger and makes a
note.
_RON STALLWORTH
"What is this about?"
Agent Y turns back.
_AGENT Y
"Two Names on your list work at NORAD."
_RON STALLWORTH
"The Two Mystery men. Steve and Jerry?"
_AGENT Y
"Their real names are Harry Dricks and Kevin Nelson. Two Clowns with Top Security clearances. These Klansmen are in charge of monitoring our Safety."
Agent Y lets this sink in. Even Ron is surprised by this.
_AGENT Y (CONT'D)
"You've done a Service to your Country."
Agent Y slips Ron a folder full of Papers.
_AGENT Y (CONT'D)
"We've been monitoring your Investigation. Impressive."
Ron flips through the Papers. Various documents about The
History of The Colorado Klan.
Agent Y takes a thoughtful pause.
_AGENT Y (CONT'D)
"Last night, Fort Carson reported several C4 Explosives missing from their Armory. No suspects."
_RON STALLWORTH
"Klan...?"
Agent Y doesn't say anything. Not confirming, not denying.
_RON STALLWORTH (CONT'D)
"We thought they might pull something. But not like this?"
_AGENT Y
"You won't see this on the News. For obvious reasons but I thought it might be of interest to you."
Agent Y rises to his feet. Ron rises as well.
_RON STALLWORTH
"If you know about an attack, I need to know when."
_AGENT Y
"You're the one with the Impressive Investigation."
Agent Y walks to his car.
_RON STALLWORTH
"But... can't you, The FBI pitch in?"
Agent Y gets in his car.
_AGENT Y
"Federal Bureau of Investigation?"
Ron just looks at him.
_AGENT Y (CONT'D)
"Because we never had this conversation."
Agent Y drives off.
Felix and Flip are alone.
_FELIX
"Flip, I'm starting to trust you. I'm gonna tell you something none of our Brothers know. My lil' sister married a Nigger. Now I got a lil' Nigger Niece and a lil' Nigger Nephew. Jesus Christ, The World's going to Hell in a Handbasket! Do me a favor, don't tell nobody. Cuz' if you do, I'm gonna have to shoot you dead. I'm serious."
_FLIP
"Thanks for sharing."
EXT. FREEDOM HOUSE, PORCH - DAY
Ron and Patrice are going at it on the Porch. The Freedom
House Protestors assemble on the street to March on the KKK.
_RON STALLWORTH
"You can hate me all you want to, just promise me you won't go to The Protest."
_PATRICE
"I'm going. We're going. What are you talking about?"
_RON STALLWORTH
"I can't say specifics but today, The Klan is planning an Attack."
_PATRICE
"Then we have to tell The People."
_RON STALLWORTH
"Not an option."
_PATRICE
"What's wrong with you?"
_RON STALLWORTH
"No one can know while it's an Active Investigation..."
_PATRICE
"Active Investigation? And pray tell how do you know all this? You a Cop?"
_RON STALLWORTH
"I'm not a Cop."
Silence.
_PATRICE
"What are you, then?..."
Ron takes a moment. Then...
_RON STALLWORTH
"...I'm a Undercover Detective. I've been investigating The Klan."
_PATRICE
"Fuckin' KKK? Ron Stallworth, you lied to me. Is that even your real name?"
_RON STALLWORTH
"Ron Stallworth is my first and last name. Today's not the day..."
_PATRICE
"I take my Duties as President Of The Black Student Union seriously. What is this all about?"
_RON STALLWORTH
"All the good it does. You could sit in the middle of Nevada Avenue and set yourself on Fire and The Klan will still be here."
_PATRICE
"I'd be doing something. Unlike you."
_RON STALLWORTH
"Unlike Me? Don't think because I'm not wearing a Black Beret, Black Leather Jacket and Black Ray Bans screaming "KILL WHITEY" doesn't mean I don't care about my People."
Patrice takes this in.
_PATRICE
"That night we saw Brother Kwame... were you Undercover then too?"
_RON STALLWORTH
"Patrice..."
_PATRICE
"...Answer the question. Were you Undercover The Night we met?"
Ron is silent.
_PATRICE (CONT'D)
"Ron Stallworth are you for Revolution and The Liberation of Black People?"
_RON STALLWORTH
"I'm a Undercover Detective for The Colorado Springs Police Department. It's my J-O-B."
_PATRICE
"House Niggers said they had J-O-B-S too. You disgust me. OMITTED"
INT. PHONE BOOTH - DAY
Butch is on the phone.
_BUTCH
"It's off."
INT. INTELLIGENCE UNIT - RON'S DESK - DAY
INTERCUT WITH BUTCH. Ron on the phone with Butch.
_RON STALLWORTH
"The March?"
_BUTCH
"Yeah."
_RON STALLWORTH
"What's going on?"
_BUTCH
"You'll know soon enough."
CLICK! Ron hangs up the phone, dreading this. He turns to
Sgt. Trapp and Flip who have been standing there, listening.
_RON STALLWORTH
"Felix just said the March was cancelled."
_FLIP
"Why?"
All Ron can do is shake his head. He paces, concerned.
_SGT. TRAPP
"Could be all the Death Threats."
_RON STALLWORTH
"They're used to that."
_FLIP
"And there's been nothing more about explosives?"
_RON STALLWORTH
"No."
Chief Bridges walks in unexpectedly with Landers. Everyone
snaps up, respectful.
_CHIEF BRIDGES (CONT'D)
"...I have a Special Assignment for Ron."
_SGT. TRAPP
"Ron already has an assignment."
_RON STALLWORTH
"What's more important than preventing an Attack?"
Chief Bridges hands Ron "The Devin Davis Death Threat Fax."
_CHIEF BRIDGES
"There are very credible threats to Devin Davis's Life. Ron, I'm assigning you to be Security Detail for Davis."
A Shockwave.
_RON STALLWORTH
"I don't think that's a wise decision..."
_LANDERS
"...Davis needs protection. There's no one else available."
_CHIEF BRIDGES
"Ron, it's Nut Cracking Time. Put your Personal Politics aside."
_FLIP
"Chief, it's not about that and you know it. Devin Davis and Ron have been speaking over the phone, several times. If he recognizes his voice... or if any of The Klansmen do, it could compromise Our Entire Investigation."
_RON STALLWORTH
"A Clusterfuck."
CHIEF BRIDGES curls a smile.
_CHIEF BRIDGES
"Correct me if I'm wrong but didn't you boast that you were fluent in both English and Jive?"
Ron is quiet.
_CHIEF BRIDGES (CONT'D)
"Do you remember that?"
_LANDERS
"Answer The Chief!"
Ron goes at Landers.
_RON STALLWORTH
"Man, who you think you're talking to. You've been trying to sabotage me since Day One."
_CHIEF BRIDGES
"Gentlemen."
_LANDERS
"Why you getting so worked up, Boy?"
_RON STALLWORTH
"Who you callin' Boy?"
Chief raises his eyebrows from the comment. A pissed Master
Patrolman Landers turns to Chief Bridges for support but he
says nothing. Landers then Exits. Chief says to Ron.
_CHIEF BRIDGES
"If you let him get to you that easy, you ain't got a Shot with Devin Davis."
Ron takes his SMALL NOTE PAD out and writes something down
again. Chief Bridges looks at him confused.
INT. FELIX'S HOUSE/GARAGE - NIGHT
A work light shines over them. WALKER, 40's, a tattooed Ex-
Con and Demolitions Expert, instructs Felix, Ivanhoe and
Connie. They stand around a large work bench in the garage.
He carefully removes a large C4 Bomb from his gym bag.
_WALKER
"Listen up. First, The Primary Target."
Walker speaks to Connie. He sets The Bomb on the work bench.
_WALKER (CONT'D)
"Felix says you're doing it. So all you have to do is set the pocketbook on the front porch, back porch, side wall, doesn't matter. It just has to be against the building. You can plant it anywhere. There's enough C4 here to take the whole thing out."
Walker hands the C4 to Felix.
_WALKER
"Be careful with that."
_FELIX
"Understand?"
Felix hands the C4 to Connie.
_CONNIE
"I understand."
_WALKER
"All you have to do when you've placed it..."
Walker puts his Finger on the Toggle Switch.
_WALKER (CONT'D)
"...is flip this switch. That's it. Got it?"
Walker passes the detonator to Felix, who passes it to
Connie.
_FELIX
"Miss Black Student Union Bitch is bringing in some Old Coon to speak. The place should be packed. So Walker, nothing but rubble..."
_WALKER
"...And Barbecue Niggers."
Ivanhoe laughs, liking that. Walker carefully removes another
Smaller Bomb from the bag. He can hold it in one hand.
_FELIX
"And what happens if that don't work?"
_WALKER
"Plan B."
_FELIX
"Can you handle it, Honey?"
_CONNIE
"You can count on me. I've been waiting to do my part."
He gives her a peck on the lips.
_WALKER
"Lovebirds. Get a Hotel Room."
Connie puts the C-4, Smaller Bomb and Detonator into her
Pocketbook. Ivanhoe reaches for it.
_IVANHOE
"Can I feel it?"
_WALKER
"No!!! No feel!!!"
EXT. ANTLERS HOTEL - DAY
Ron still in plain clothes parks his unmarked car in the lot
of The Luxurious Antlers Hotel on South Cascade Ave.
He walks toward the entrance, where the Six Bikers stand
around Davis' Sedan. The Bikers all look up simultaneously.
_RON STALLWORTH
"I'm Mr. Davis' Security Detail."
They look at each other, then back at Ron. They say nothing.
Just then Davis emerges from The Hotel, wearing a neatly
pressed Suit and Tie. He nods to the Bikers, then looks up at
the Plainclothes Black Detective in front of him.
Ron steps forward, extending a hand.
_RON STALLWORTH (CONT'D)
"Hello, Mr. Davis. I'm a Detective from The Colorado Springs Police Department and I will be acting as your Bodyguard today."
Davis smiles and shakes Ron's hand.
_DEVIN DAVIS
"Detective, pleased to meet you."
_RON STALLWORTH
"As you may know, there have been several credible Threats against your Well-Being."
Walter and Ivanhoe walk outside The Hotel seeing Ron standing
with Devin Davis.
_WALTER
"Da Heck's going on here?"
_DEVIN DAVIS
"There are Threats on my Life. This Detective has been assigned as my Bodyguard."
Walter and Ivanhoe smile broadly. Ron changes his VOICE
slightly for Walter.
_RON STALLWORTH
"Let me be clear, Mr. Davis: I do not agree with your Philosophies. However I am a Professional and I will do everything within my means and beyond to keep you safe."
Davis stands there a moment, processing all of this. Maybe
he's heard that voice somewhere before? Then...
_DEVIN DAVIS
"I appreciate your Professionalism."
"OMITTED"

INT. STEAKHOUSE - DAY
Flip follows Walter to a large Table near the back, where
Felix, Ivanhoe and other Chapter Members stand around
chatting with Devin Davis.
Everyone stands in line in awe of The Grand Wizard to shake
his hand. Davis turns and smiles as Flip approaches.
_WALTER
"Mr. Davis, our newest recruit, Ron Stallworth."
He shakes both of their Hands.
_DEVIN DAVIS
"Ron, it's my pleasure to finally meet you in person."
Both of Davis' hands clasp Flip's hand tight.
_FLIP
"You as well."
Davis pauses a moment as he processes Flip's voice. Is this
the same person he's been talking to on the phone?
Davis SLAPS Flip on the back appearing like best buddies. Ron
stands in the Background.
ANGLE - STEAKHOUSE - DAY
The room filled with People mingling eating Hors d'oeuvres.

Davis and Jesse, pulling them in real close. The Polaroid
clicks and spits out the Photo instantly.
Davis is startled for a brief second... then it all happens
in a FLASH.
Davis and Ron spring toward Flip, each making a Mad Dash for
the Photo. Ron grabs it first. Davis lunges to grab the Photo
from Ron's hands but Ron yanks it away. Davis is up in Ron's
Face.
_DEVIN DAVIS
"Nigger, What the Fuck did you just do?"
_RON STALLWORTH
"If you lay one Finger on me, I'll arrest you for assaulting a Police Officer. That's worth about Five Years in Prison. Try me. See if I'm playing."
The Room falls into Dead Silence. Klansmen mouths hang open,
watching their Leaders threatened by a DETECTIVE NIGGER.
Davis gives Ron the most vicious look imaginable.
Ron stares back. It's a SHOWDOWN. Several Men in the Room
have their hands at their Waists, seconds away from drawing
their Guns.
Ron can do only one thing: he smiles.
_RON STALLWORTH (CONT'D)
"Thanks for the Photo, Mr. Davis. Big Fan. God Bless WHITE AMERICA."
Davis shakes his Head in Disgust.
Bikers and others surround Ron. Flip looks wary knowing
something is up. He gets in Ron's face, threatening.
_FLIP
"Boy you get ya' ass out NOW!"
Ron breaks off from the roomful of disdain cutting through
the watching Crowd pushing past Bodies heading toward the
front door. Suddenly, Ron's arm is grabbed...

_CHIEF BRIDGES
"Inflation... I wish I had a choice. My hands are tied. Besides, it looks like there are no longer any tangible Threats..."
_RON STALLWORTH
"...Sounds like we did too good a job."
_CHIEF BRIDGES
"Not a Bad Legacy to leave."
Bridges takes a deliberate pause. Then, THE Sucker Punch...
_CHIEF BRIDGES (CONT'D)
"And I need you, Ron Stallworth, to destroy all Evidence of this Investigation."
_RON STALLWORTH
"Excuse me?"
_FLIP
"This is total Horseshit."
_CHIEF BRIDGES
"We prefer that The Public never knew about this Investigation."
Ron and Flip are heated. Sgt. Trapp is silent but gutted.
_RON STALLWORTH
"If they found out..."
_CHIEF BRIDGES
"...Cease all further contact with The Ku Klux Klan. Effective immediately. That goes for Flip too. Ron Stallworth..."
_RON STALLWORTH
"This is some Fucked up Bullshit."
_CHIEF BRIDGES
"Take a week off. Go on vacation with your Girlfriend. We'll hold down The Fort until you get back. Get you another assignment...Narcotics."
Ron storms out.
INT. INTELLIGENCE UNIT - CSPD - DAY
Ron reflects as he feeds Investigation documents in a
Shredder. The documents shred into pieces. Just then, the
Undercover Phone Line rings on Ron's desk.
Ron stares at the Phone, still ringing. He looks at The
Documents in his hand, about to feed them into The Shredder.
Ron stops. Throws The Documents in a Folder. Sweeps some
Folders into his Briefcase. Leaves as The Phone still rings.
EXT. COLORADO SPRINGS POLICE DEPARTMENT BUILDING - DAY
Ron is walking fast now, trying to make it out of The
Building with The Evidence but he remembers something.
He stops, turns back.
INT. INTELLIGENCE DIVISION - CSPD - DAY
Ron sits at his Desk, on The Undercover Phone Line. Flip,
Jimmy and Sgt. Trapp are behind, both close enough to listen,
giggling.

"I'm sorry we didn't get to spend more One-on-One time together."
INT. DEVIN DAVIS OFFICE - DAY
INTERCUT RON, FLIP, AND TRAPP WITH DEVIN DAVIS:
_DEVIN DAVIS
"Well, that tragic event. I had just met those Fine Brothers in the cause."
_RON STALLWORTH
"Our Chapter is just shaken to the core. And poor Connie not only does she lose her Husband but she's facing a healthy Prison Sentence."
_DEVIN DAVIS
"My God. And then there was that one Nigger Detective who threatened me."
_RON STALLWORTH
"Goddamn Coloreds sure know how to spoil a Celebration."
Flip and Jimmy snort. Ron holds in a Belly-Laugh.
_DEVIN DAVIS
"Christ. You can say that again."
Ron cracks up into his Hand. Sgt. Trapp is wheezing-- his
Face Bright Pink. Flip is laughing hard in the background.
_RON STALLWORTH
"Can I ask you something? That Nigger Detective who gave you a hard time? Ever get his name?"
_DEVIN DAVIS
"No, I..."
_RON STALLWORTH
"...Are-uh you sure you don't know who he is? Are-uh you absolutely sure?"
Davis looks at his Phone. Ron takes out his SMALL NOTE PAD
out revealing a list of Racial epitaphs he had written down
being on this Investigation. He reads from it to Davis on the
phone.
