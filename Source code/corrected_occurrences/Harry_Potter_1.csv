 Little tyke ,  chortled Mr. Dursley as he left the house .;Dursley;;-0.09375;20;0
 The Potters , that 's right , that 's what I heard - ;;;0.285714285714;56;1
 - yes , their son , Harry - ;;;0.0;57;1
 Sorry ,  he grunted , as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell .;Dursley;;-0.133333333333;72;2
"On the contrary , his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare , "" Do n't be sorry , my dear sir , for nothing could upset me today ! Rejoice , for You-Know-Who has gone at last ! Even Muggles like yourself should be celebrating , this happy , happy day ! """;;You-Know-Who;0.229166666667;75;2
 Shoo !  said Mr. Dursley loudly .;Dursley;Dudley;0.1;85;3
 And finally , bird-watchers everywhere have reported that the nation 's owls have been behaving very unusually today . Although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight , there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise . Experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern .  The newscaster allowed himself a grin .;;Dudley;-0.0636111111111;96;3
 Most mysterious . And now , over to Jim McGuffin with the weather . Going to be any more showers of owls tonight , Jim ? ;;Dudley;0.333333333333;97;3
" Well , Ted ,  said the weatherman , "" I do n't know about that , but it 's not only the owls that have been acting oddly today . Viewers as far apart as Kent , Yorkshire , and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I promised yesterday , they 've had a downpour of shooting stars ! Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Night early - it 's not until next week , folks ! But I can promise a wet night tonight . """;;Dundee,Night;-0.00595238095238;98;3
 Er - Petunia , dear - you have n't heard from your sister lately , have you ? ;Dursley;;-0.3;108;4
 No ,  she said sharply .;Dursley;;-0.125;111;4
 Why ? ;Dursley;;0.0;112;4
 Funny stuff on the news ,  Mr. Dursley mumbled .;Dursley;;0.25;113;4
 Owls...shooting stars...and there were a lot of funny-looking people in town today ... ;Dursley;;0.0;114;4
 So ?  snapped Mrs. Dursley .;Dursley;;0.0;115;4
 Well , I just thought...maybe...it was something to do with...you know...her crowd . ;Dursley;;0.0;116;4
"Instead he said , as casually as he could , "" Their son - he 'd be about Dudley 's age now , would n't he ? """;Dursley;;-0.5;119;4
 I suppose so ,  said Mrs. Dursley stiffly .;Dursley;;-0.214285714286;120;4
 What 's his name again ? Howard , is n't it ? ;Dursley;;0.0;121;4
 Harry . Nasty , common name , if you ask me . ;Dursley;;-0.65;122;4
 Oh , yes ,  said Mr. Dursley , his heart sinking horribly .;Dursley;;-1.0;123;4
 Yes , I quite agree . ;Dursley;;0.0;124;4
"He chuckled and muttered , "" I should have known . """;Dumbledore;;0.0;152;5
 Fancy seeing you here , Professor McGonagall . ;Dumbledore;Fancy;0.0;162;6
 How did you know it was me ?  she asked .;McGonagall;Dumbledore,Dursley,Voldemort,Hagrid,Dudley;0.0;168;6
 My dear Professor , I 've never seen a cat sit so stiffly . ;Dumbledore;McGonagall,Dursley,Voldemort,Hagrid,Dudley;-0.214285714286;169;6
 You 'd be stiff if you 'd been sitting on a brick wall all day ,  said Professor McGonagall .;McGonagall;Dumbledore,Dursley,Voldemort,Hagrid,Dudley;-0.214285714286;170;6
 All day ? When you could have been celebrating ? I must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here . ;Dumbledore;McGonagall,Dursley,Voldemort,Hagrid,Dudley;0.0;171;6
 Oh yes , I 've celebrating , all right ,  she said impatiently .;McGonagall;Dumbledore,Dursley,Voldemort,Hagrid,Dudley;0.0428571428571;173;6
 You 'd think they 'd be a bit more careful , but no - even the Muggles have noticed something 's going on . It was on their news .  She jerked her head back at the Dursleys ' dark living-room window .;Dumbledore;Muggle;0.0625;174;6
 I heard it . Flocks of owls...shooting stars...Well , they 're not completely stupid . They were bound to notice something . Shooting stars down in Kent - I 'll bet that was Dedalus Diggle . He never had much sense . ;McGonagall;Diggle;0.148148148148;175;6
 You ca n't blame them ,  said Dumbledore gently .;Dumbledore;McGonagall,Dursley,Voldemort,Hagrid,Dudley;0.2;176;6
 We 've had precious little to celebrate for eleven years . ;Dumbledore;Dumbledore,McGonagall,Dursley,Voldemort,Dudley;0.15625;177;6
 I know that ,  said Professor McGonagall irritably .;McGonagall;Dumbledore,Dursley,Voldemort,Hagrid,Dudley;0.0;178;6
 But that 's no reason to lose our heads . People are being downright careless , out on the streets in broad daylight , not even dressed in Muggle clothes , swapping rumors . ;McGonagall;McGonagall,Dursley,Voldemort,Hagrid,Dudley;-0.21875;179;6
 A fine thing it would be if , on the very day You-Know-Who seems to have disappeared at last , the Muggles found out about us all . I suppose he really has gone , Dumbledore ? ;McGonagall;Muggle;0.204166666667;181;6
 It certainly seems so ,  said Dumbledore .;Dumbledore;McGonagall,Dursley,Voldemort,Hagrid,Dudley;0.214285714286;182;6
 We have much to be thankful for . Would you care for a lemon drop ? ;Dumbledore;Dumbledore,Dursley,Voldemort,Hagrid,Dudley;0.2;183;6
 A what ? ;McGonagall;McGonagall,Dursley,Voldemort,Hagrid,Dudley;0.0;184;6
 A lemon drop . They 're a kind of Muggle sweet I 'm rather fond of . ;Dumbledore;Muggle;0.475;185;6
 No , thank you ,  said Professor McGonagall coldly , as though she did n't think this was the moment for lemon drops .;McGonagall;Dumbledore,Dursley,Voldemort,Hagrid,Dudley;-0.6;186;6
 As I say , even if You-Know-Who has gone - ;McGonagall;You-Know-Who;0.0;187;6
 My dear Professor , surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by his name ? All this ' You-Know-Who ' nonsense - for eleven years I have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name : Voldemort .  Professor McGonagall flinched , but Dumbledore , who was unsticking two lemon drops , seemed not to notice .;Dumbledore;Dumbledore,Dursley,Voldemort,Hagrid,Dudley;0.25;188;6
 It all gets so confusing if we keep saying ' You-Know-Who . ' I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort 's name . ;Dumbledore;Voldemort;-0.3;189;6
 I know you have n't , said Professor McGonagall , sounding half exasperated , half admiring .  But you 're different .;McGonagall;McGonagall;-0.111111111111;190;6
"You flatter me , "" said Dumbledore calmly .";Dumbledore;McGonagall,Dursley,Voldemort,Hagrid,Dudley;0.3;193;6
 Voldemort had powers I will never have . ;Dumbledore;Voldemort;0.0;194;6
 Only because you 're too - well - noble to use them . ;McGonagall;McGonagall,Dursley,Voldemort,Hagrid,Dudley;0.3;195;6
 It 's lucky it 's dark . I have n't blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs . ;Dumbledore;Pomfrey;0.223939393939;196;6
"Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and said "" The owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around . You know what they 're saying ? About why he 's disappeared ? About what finally stopped him ? """;McGonagall;Dumbledore,Dursley,Voldemort,Hagrid,Dudley;-0.0416666666667;197;6
" What they 're saying ,  she pressed on , "" is that last night Voldemort turned up in Godric 's Hollow . He went to find the Potters . The rumor is that Lily and James Potter are - are - that they 're - dead . """;McGonagall;Voldemort,Potter;-0.1;201;6
 Lily and James...I ca n't believe it...I did n't want to believe it...Oh , Albus ... ;McGonagall;Potter;0.0;204;6
 I know...I know ...  he said heavily .;Dumbledore;McGonagall,Dursley,Voldemort,Hagrid,Dudley;-0.2;206;6
 That 's not all . They 're saying he tried to kill the Potter 's son , Harry . But he could n't . He could n't kill that little boy . No one knows why , or how , but they 're saying that when he could n't kill Harry Potter , Voldemort 's power somehow broke - and that 's why he 's gone . ;McGonagall;Potter,Harry;-0.1875;208;6
 It 's - it 's true ?  faltered Professor McGonagall .;McGonagall;Dumbledore,Dursley,Voldemort,Hagrid,Dudley;0.35;210;6
 After all he 's done...all the people he 's killed...he could n't kill a little boy ? It 's just astounding...of all the things to stop him...but how in the name of heaven did Harry survive ? ;McGonagall;Harry;-0.1875;211;6
 We can only guess .  said Dumbledore .;Dumbledore;McGonagall,Dursley,Voldemort,Hagrid,Dudley;0.0;212;6
 We may never know . ;Dumbledore;Dumbledore,Dursley,Voldemort,Hagrid,Dudley;0.0;213;6
"It must have made sense to Dumbledore , though , because he put it back in his pocket and said , "" Hagrid 's late . I suppose it was he who told you I 'd be here , by the way ? """;Dumbledore;McGonagall,Dursley,Voldemort,Hagrid,Dudley;-0.15;218;6
 Yes ,  said Professor McGonagall .;McGonagall;Dumbledore,Dursley,Voldemort,Hagrid,Dudley;0.0;219;6
 And I do n't suppose you 're going to tell me why you 're here , of all places ? ;McGonagall;McGonagall,Dursley,Voldemort,Hagrid,Dudley;0.0;220;6
 I 've come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle . They 're the only family he has left now . ;Dumbledore;Harry;0.0;221;6
 You do n't mean â€“ you ca n't mean the people who live here ?  cried Professor McGonagall , jumping to her feet and pointing at number four .;McGonagall;Dumbledore,Dursley,Voldemort,Hagrid,Dudley;0.149621212121;222;6
 Dumbledore - you ca n't . I 've been watching them all day . You could n't find two people who are less like us . And they 've got this son - I saw him kicking his mother all the way up the street , screaming for sweets . Harry Potter come and live here ! ;McGonagall;Dumbledore,McGonagall,Dursley,Voldemort,Dudley;0.00189393939394;223;6
 It 's the best place for him ,  said Dumbledore firmly .;Dumbledore;McGonagall,Dursley,Voldemort,Hagrid,Dudley;0.4;224;6
 His aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when he 's older . I 've written them a letter . ;Dumbledore;Dumbledore,McGonagall,Dursley,Voldemort,Dudley;0.333333333333;225;6
 A letter ?  repeated Professor McGonagall faintly , sitting back down on the wall .;McGonagall;Dumbledore,Dursley,Voldemort,Hagrid,Dudley;-0.218518518519;226;6
 Really , Dumbledore , you think you can explain all this in a letter ? These people will never understand him ! He 'll be famous - a legend - I would n't be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter day in the future - there will be books written about Harry - every child in our world will know his name ! ;McGonagall;Dumbledore,McGonagall,Dursley,Voldemort,Dudley;0.2125;227;6
 Exactly .  said Dumbledore , looking very seriously over the top of his half-moon glasses .;Dumbledore;McGonagall,Dursley,Voldemort,Hagrid,Dudley;0.105555555556;228;6
 It would be enough to turn any boy 's head . Famous before he can walk and talk ! Famous for something he wo n't even remember ! Can you see how much better off he 'll be , growing up away from all that until he 's ready to take it ? ;Dumbledore;Dumbledore,McGonagall,Dursley,Voldemort,Dudley;0.39;229;6
"Professor McGonagall opened her mouth , changed her mind , swallowed , and then said , "" Yes - yes , you 're right , of course . But how is the boy getting here , Dumbledore ? "" She eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought he might be hiding Harry underneath it .";McGonagall;Dumbledore,Dursley,Voldemort,Hagrid,Dudley;0.142857142857;230;6
 Hagrid 's bringing him . ;Dumbledore;McGonagall,Dursley,Voldemort,Hagrid,Dudley;0.0;231;6
 You think it - wise - to trust Hagrid with something as important as this ? ;McGonagall;Hagrid;0.55;232;6
 I would trust Hagrid with my life ,  said Dumbledore .;Dumbledore;Hagrid;0.0;233;6
" I 'm not saying his heart is n't in the right place ,  said Professor McGonagall grudgingly , "" but you ca n't pretend he 's not careless . He does tend to - what was that ? """;McGonagall;Dumbledore,Dursley,Voldemort,Hagrid,Dudley;-0.0214285714286;234;6
 Hagrid ,  said Dumbledore , sounding relieved .;Dumbledore;McGonagall,Dursley,Voldemort,Hagrid,Dudley;0.0;241;6
 At last . And where did you get that motorcycle ? ;Dumbledore;Dumbledore,Dursley,Voldemort,Hagrid,Dudley;0.0;242;6
 Borrowed it , Professor Dumbledore , sir ,  said the giant , climbing carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke .;Hagrid;McGonagall,Dursley,Voldemort,Hagrid,Dudley;-0.05;243;6
 Young Sirius Black lent it to me . I 've got him , sir . ;Hagrid;Black;-0.0333333333333;244;6
 No problems , were there ? ;Dumbledore;McGonagall,Dursley,Voldemort,Hagrid,Dudley;0.0;245;6
 No , sir - house was almost destroyed , but I got him out all right before the Muggles started swarmin ' around . He fell asleep as we was flyin ' over Bristol . ;Hagrid;Muggle;0.285714285714;246;6
 Is that where - ?  whispered Professor McGonagall .;McGonagall;Dumbledore,Dursley,Voldemort,Hagrid,Dudley;0.0;250;6
 Yes ,  said Dumbledore .;Dumbledore;McGonagall,Dursley,Voldemort,Hagrid,Dudley;0.0;251;6
 He 'll have that scar forever . ;Dumbledore;Dumbledore,Dursley,Voldemort,Hagrid,Dudley;0.0;252;6
 Could n't you do something about it , Dumbledore ? ;McGonagall;McGonagall,Dursley,Voldemort,Hagrid,Dudley;0.0;253;6
 Even if I could , I would n't . Scars can come in handy . I have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the London Underground . Well - give him here , Hagrid - we 'd better get this over with . ;Dumbledore;Dumbledore,Dursley,Voldemort,Hagrid,Dudley;0.42;254;6
 Could I - could I say good-bye to him , sir ?  asked Hagrid .;Hagrid;Dumbledore,McGonagall,Dursley,Voldemort,Dudley;0.0;256;6
" Shhh !  hissed Professor McGonagall , "" You 'll wake the Muggles ! """;McGonagall;Dumbledore,Dursley,Voldemort,Hagrid,Dudley;0.0;259;6
 S-s-sorry ,  sobbed Hagrid , taking out a large , spotted handkerchief and burying his face in it .;Hagrid;Dumbledore,McGonagall,Dursley,Voldemort,Dudley;0.214285714286;260;6
 But I c-c-ca n't stand it - Lily an ' James dead - an ' poor little Harry off ter live with Muggles - ;Hagrid;McGonagall,Dursley,Voldemort,Hagrid,Dudley;-0.162784090909;261;6
 Yes , yes , it 's all very sad , but get a grip on yourself , Hagrid , or we 'll be found ,  Professor McGonagall whispered , patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door .;McGonagall;Dumbledore,Dursley,Voldemort,Hagrid,Dudley;-0.325;262;6
" Well ,  said Dumbledore finally , "" that 's that . We 've no business staying here . We may as well go and join the celebrations . """;Dumbledore;McGonagall,Dursley,Voldemort,Hagrid,Dudley;0.0;265;6
" Yeah ,  said Hagrid in a very muffled voice , "" I 'll be takin ' Sirius his bike back . G'night , Professor McGonagall - Professor Dumbledore , sir . """;Hagrid;Dumbledore,McGonagall,Dursley,Voldemort,Dudley;0.1;266;6
 I shall see you soon , I expect , Professor McGonagall ,  said Dumbledore , nodding to her .;Dumbledore;McGonagall,Dursley,Voldemort,Hagrid,Dudley;0.0;268;6
 Good luck , Harry ,  he murmured .;Dumbledore;Dumbledore,Dursley,Voldemort,Hagrid,Dudley;0.7;274;6
 Up ! Get up ! Now ! ;Dursley;;0.0;291;7
 Up !  she screeched .;Dursley;;0.0;294;7
 Are you up yet ?  she demanded .;Dursley;;0.0;301;7
 Nearly ,  said Harry .;Harry;;0.1;302;7
 Well , get a move on , I want you to look after the bacon . And do n't you dare let it burn , I want everything perfect on Duddy 's birthday . ;Dursley;;1.0;303;7
 What did you say ?  his aunt snapped through the door .;Dursley;;0.0;305;7
 Nothing , nothing ... ;Harry;;0.0;306;7
 In the car crash when your parents died ,  she had said .;Petunia;Vernon;0.0;323;8
 And do n't ask questions . ;Petunia;Vernon;0.0;324;8
 Comb your hair !  he barked , by way of a morning greeting .;Vernon;Petunia;0.0;327;8
 Thirty-six ,  he said , looking up at his mother and father .;Dudley;Petunia,Harry,Vernon;0.0;337;9
 That 's two less than last year . ;Dudley;Dudley,Petunia,Vernon;-0.0833333333333;338;9
 Darling , you have n't counted Auntie Marge 's present , see , it 's here under this big one from Mummy and Daddy . ;Petunia;Marge;0.0;339;9
 All right , thirty-seven then ,  said Dudley , going red in the face .;Dudley;Petunia,Harry,Vernon;0.142857142857;340;9
"Aunt Petunia obviously scented danger , too , because she said quickly , "" And we 'll buy you another two presents while we 're out today . How 's that , popkin ? Two more presents . Is that all right """;Petunia;Dudley,Harry,Vernon;0.279761904762;342;9
"Finally he said slowly , "" So I 'll have thirty...thirty ... """;Dudley;Dudley,Petunia,Vernon;-0.15;345;9
 Thirty-nine , sweetums ,  said Aunt Petunia .;Petunia;Dudley,Harry,Vernon;0.0;346;9
 Oh.  Dudley sat down heavily and grabbed the nearest parcel .;Dudley;Petunia,Harry,Vernon;-0.177777777778;347;9
 All right then . ;Dudley;Dudley,Petunia,Vernon;0.285714285714;348;9
 Little tyke wants his money 's worth , just like his father . ' Atta boy , Dudley !  He ruffled Dudley 's hair .;Vernon;Petunia,Harry,Vernon;0.129166666667;350;9
 Bad news , Vernon ,  she said .;Petunia;Dudley,Harry,Vernon;-0.7;353;9
 Mrs. Figg 's broken her leg . She ca n't take him .  She jerked her head in Harry 's direction .;Petunia;Dudley,Petunia,Vernon;-0.4;354;9
 Now what ?  said Aunt Petunia , looking furiously at Harry as though he 'd planned this .;Petunia;Dudley,Harry,Vernon;0.0;360;9
 We could phone Marge ,  Uncle Vernon suggested .;Vernon;Marge;0.0;362;9
 Do n't be silly , Vernon , she hates the boy . ;Petunia;Dudley,Harry,Vernon;-0.5;363;9
 What about what ' s-her-name , your friend - Yvonne ? ;Vernon;Dudley,Petunia,Vernon;0.0;365;9
 On vacation in Majorca ,  snapped Aunt Petunia .;Petunia;Dudley,Harry,Vernon;0.0;366;9
 You could just leave me here ,  Harry put in hopefully ( he 'd be able to watch what he wanted on television for a change and maybe even have a go on Dudley 's computer ) .;Harry;Dudley,Petunia,Vernon;0.5;367;9
 And come back and find the house in ruins ?  she snarled .;Petunia;Dudley,Harry,Vernon;-0.75;369;9
 I wo n't blow up the house ,  said Harry , but they were n't listening .;Harry;Dudley,Petunia,Vernon;0.0;370;9
" I suppose we could take him to the zoo ,  said Aunt Petunia slowly , "" ...and leave him in the car ... """;Petunia;Dudley,Harry,Vernon;-0.3;371;9
 That car 's new , he 's not sitting in it alone ... ;Vernon;Dudley,Petunia,Vernon;0.136363636364;372;9
 Dinky Duddydums , do n't cry , Mummy wo n't let him spoil your special day !  she cried , flinging her arms around him .;Petunia;Mummy;0.446428571429;375;9
 I...do n't...want...him...t-t-to come !  Dudley yelled between huge , pretend sobs .;Dudley;Petunia,Harry,Vernon;0.4;376;9
 He always sp-spoils everything !  He shot Harry a nasty grin through the gap in his mother 's arms .;Dudley;Dudley,Petunia,Vernon;-1.0;377;9
"Just then , the doorbell rang - "" Oh , good Lord , they 're here ! "" said Aunt Petunia frantically - and a moment later , Dudley 's best friend , Piers Polkiss , walked in with his mother .";Petunia;Dudley,Harry,Vernon;0.625;378;9
" I 'm warning you ,  he had said , putting his large purple face right up close to Harry ' s , "" I 'm warning you now , boy - any funny business , anything at all - and you 'll be in that cupboard from now until Christmas . """;Vernon;Dudley,Petunia,Vernon;0.25;384;9
" I 'm not going to do anything ,  said Harry , "" honestly ... """;Harry;Dudley,Petunia,Vernon;0.6;385;9
 ...roaring along like maniacs , the young hoodlums ,  he said , as a motorcycle overtook them .;Vernon;;0.1;404;10
 I had a dream about a motorcycle ,  said Harry , remembering suddenly .;Harry;;0.0;405;10
 It was flying . ;Harry;;0.0;406;10
"He turned right around in his seat and yelled at Harry , his face like a gigantic beet with a mustache : "" MOTORCYCLES DON'T FLY ! """;Vernon;;0.642857142857;408;10
 I know they do n't ,  said Harry .;Harry;;0.0;410;10
 It was only a dream . ;Harry;;0.0;411;10
 Make it move ,  he whined at his father .;Dudley;;0.0;429;11
 Do it again ,  Dudley ordered .;Dudley;;0.0;431;11
 This is boring ,  Dudley moaned .;Dudley;;-1.0;433;11
 I get that all the time . ;Harry;Harry,Piers;0.0;447;12
 I know ,  Harry murmured through the glass , though he was n't sure the snake could hear him .;Harry;Piers,Petunia;-0.25;448;12
 It must be really annoying . ;Harry;Harry,Piers;-0.8;449;12
 Where do you come from , anyway ?  Harry asked .;Harry;Piers,Petunia;0.0;451;12
 Was it nice there ? ;Harry;Harry,Piers;0.6;455;12
 Oh , I see - so you 've never been to Brazil ? ;Harry;Piers,Petunia;0.0;457;12
 DUDLEY ! MR . DURSLEY ! COME AND LOOK AT THIS SNAKE ! YOU WON'T BELIEVE WHAT IT'S DOING ! ;Piers;Harry,Piers;-0.125;459;12
 Out of the way , you ,  he said , punching Harry in the ribs .;Piers;Piers,Petunia;0.0;461;12
"As the snake slid swiftly past him , Harry could have sworn a low , hissing voice said , "" Brazil , here I come ... Thanksss , amigo . """;Snake;Piers,Petunia;-0.125;467;12
" But the glass ,  he kept saying , "" where did the glass go ? """;Vernon;Harry,Piers;0.0;469;12
"But worst of all , for Harry at least , was Piers calming down enough to say , "" Harry was talking to it , were n't you , Harry ? """;Piers;Harry;-0.363888888889;473;12
"He managed to say , "" Go - cupboard - stay - no meals , "" before he collapsed into a chair , and Aunt Petunia had to run and get him a large brandy .";Petunia;Harry,Piers;0.214285714286;476;12
 They stuff people 's heads down the toilet the first day at Stonewall ,  he told Harry .;Dudley;Dudley;0.0203703703704;514;13
 Want to come upstairs and practice ? ;Dudley;Dudley;0.0;515;13
 No , thanks ,  said Harry .;Harry;Dudley;-0.1;516;13
 The poor toilet 's never had anything as horrible as your head down it - it might be sick .  Then he ran , before Dudley could work out what he 'd said .;Harry;Harry;-0.460634920635;517;13
 What 's this ?  he asked Aunt Petunia .;Harry;Harry,Vernon;0.0;534;14
 Your new school uniform ,  she said .;Petunia;Petunia,Harry;0.136363636364;536;14
" Oh ,  he said , "" I did n't realize it had to be so wet . """;Harry;Petunia,Vernon;-0.1;538;14
 Do n't be stupid ,  snapped Aunt Petunia .;Petunia;Petunia,Harry;-0.8;539;14
 I 'm dyeing some of Dudley 's old things gray for you . It 'll look just like everyone else 's when I 've finished . ;Petunia;Petunia,Vernon;0.1;540;14
 Get the mail , Dudley ,  said Uncle Vernon from behind his paper .;Vernon;Petunia,Harry;-0.4;546;14

 No one . It was addressed to you by mistake ,  said Uncle Vernon shortly .;Vernon;Harry;0.0;611;16

 Er - yes , Harry - about this cupboard . Your aunt and I have been thinking...you 're really getting a bit big for it...we think it might be nice if you moved into Dudley 's second bedroom .;Vernon;Harry;0.2;616;16

 Ah , shut up , Dursley , yeh great prune ,  said the giant  ,  he reached over the back of the sofa , jerked the gun out of Uncle Vernon 's hands , bent it into a knot as easily as if it had been made of rubber , and threw it into a corner of the room .;Hagrid;Dudley,Harry,Hagrid;0.308333333333;821;25

 True , I have n't introduced meself . Rubeus Hagrid , Keeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts . ;Hagrid;Dudley,Harry,Vernon;0.35;830;25

 I 'd not say no ter summat stronger if yeh 've got it , mind . ;Hagrid;Dudley,Harry,Vernon;0.0;833;25

 Sorry ?  barked Hagrid , turning to stare at the Dursleys , who shrank back into the shadows .;Hagrid;Dudley,Harry,Vernon;-0.25;850;25
 It 's them as should be sorry ! I knew yeh were n't gettin ' yer letters but I never thought yeh would n't even know abou ' Hogwarts , fer cryin ' out loud ! Did yeh never wonder where yer parents learned it all ? ;Hagrid;Dudley,Harry,Hagrid;-0.25;851;25

 ALL WHAT ?  Hagrid thundered .;Hagrid;Dudley,Harry,Vernon;0.0;853;25

 I mean , they 're famous . You 're famous . ;Hagrid;Dudley,Harry,Vernon;0.229166666667;869;25

 Yeh don ' know...yeh don ' know ...  Hagrid ran his fingers through his hair , fixing Harry with a bewildered stare .;Hagrid;Yeh;0.0;871;25
 Yeh don ' know what yeh are ?  he said finally .;Hagrid;Yeh;0.0;872;25
 Stop !  he commanded .;Vernon;Dudley,Harry,Hagrid;0.0;874;25
 Stop right there , sir ! I forbid you to tell the boy anything ! ;Vernon;Dudley,Vernon,Hagrid;0.446428571429;875;25
 You never told him ? Never told him what was in the letter Dumbledore left fer him ? I was there ! I saw Dumbledore leave it , Dursley ! An ' you 've kept it from him all these years ? ;Hagrid;Fluffy,Dumbledore;0.0;877;25
 Kept what from me ?  said Harry eagerly .;Harry;Dudley,Vernon,Hagrid;0.0;878;25
 STOP ! I FORBID YOU !  yelled Uncle Vernon in panic .;Vernon;Dudley,Harry,Hagrid;0.0;879;25
 Ah , go boil yer heads , both of yeh ,  said Hagrid .;Hagrid;Dudley,Harry,Vernon;0.0;881;25
 Harry - yer a wizard . ;Hagrid;Dudley,Harry,Hagrid;0.0;882;25
 I 'm a what ?  gasped Harry .;Harry;Dudley,Vernon,Hagrid;0.0;885;25
" A wizard , o ' course ,  said Hagrid , sitting back down on the sofa , which groaned and sank even lower , "" an ' a thumpin ' good ' un , I 'd say , once yeh 've been trained up a bit .

"After a few minutes he stammered , "" What does it mean , they await my owl ? """;Harry;;-0.25625;908;26
 Gallopin ' Gorgons , that reminds me ,  said Hagrid , clapping a hand to his forehead with enough force to knock over a cart horse , and from yet another pocket inside his overcoat he pulled an owl - a real , live , rather ruffled-looking owl - a long quill , and a roll of parchment .;Hagrid;;0.0515151515152;909;26
 Where was I ?  said Hagrid , but at that moment , Uncle Vernon , still ashen-faced but looking very angry , moved into the firelight .;Hagrid;Harry,Vernon,Petunia,Dursley;-0.65;922;27
 He 's not going ,  he said .;Vernon;Hagrid,Vernon,Petunia,Dursley;0.0;923;27
 I 'd like ter see a great Muggle like you stop him ,  he said .;Hagrid;Muggle;0.8;925;27
 A what ?  said Harry , interested .;Harry;Hagrid,Vernon,Petunia,Dursley;0.25;926;27
" A Muggle ,  said Hagrid , "" it 's what we call nonmagic folk like them . An ' it 's your bad luck you grew up in a family o ' the biggest Muggles I ever laid eyes on . """;Hagrid;Harry,Vernon,Petunia,Dursley;-0.7;927;27
" We swore when we took him in we 'd put a stop to that rubbish ,  said Uncle Vernon , "" swore we 'd stamp it out of him ! Wizard indeed ! """;Vernon;Hagrid,Harry,Petunia,Dursley;0.0;928;27
 You knew ?  said Harry .;Harry;Hagrid,Vernon,Petunia,Dursley;0.0;929;27
 You knew I 'm a - a wizard ? ;Harry;Harry,Vernon,Petunia,Dursley;0.0;930;27
 Knew !  shrieked Aunt Petunia suddenly .;Petunia;Hagrid,Harry,Vernon,Dursley;0.0;931;27
 Knew ! Of course we knew ! How could you not be , my dratted sister being what she was ? Oh , she got a letter just like that and disappeared off to that - that school - and came home every vacation with her pockets full of frog spawn , turning teacups into rats . I was the only one who saw her for what she was - a freak ! But for my mother and father , oh no , it was Lily this and Lily that , they were proud of having a witch in the family ! ;Petunia;Lily;0.45;932;27
 Then she met that Potter at school and they left and got married and had you , and of course I knew you 'd be just the same , just as strange , just as - as - abnormal - and then , if you please , she went and got herself blown up and we got landed with you ! ;Petunia;Hagrid,Vernon,Petunia,Dursley;0.046875;935;27
"As soon as he found his voice he said , "" Blown up ? You told me they died in a car crash ! """;Harry;Harry,Vernon,Petunia,Dursley;0.0;937;27
 CAR CRASH !  roared Hagrid , jumping up so angrily that the Dursleys scuttled back to their corner .;Hagrid;Hagrid,Harry,Vernon,Petunia;-0.25;938;27
 How could a car crash kill Lily an ' James Potter ? It 's an outrage ! A scandal ! Harry Potter not knowin ' his own story when every kid in our world knows his name ! ;Hagrid;Harry,Lily;0.75;939;27
 But why ? What happened ?  Harry asked urgently .;Harry;Hagrid,Vernon,Petunia,Dursley;0.0;940;27
 I never expected this ,  he said , in a low , worried voice .;Hagrid;Harry,Vernon,Petunia,Dursley;0.25;943;27
 I had no idea , when Dumbledore told me there might be trouble gettin ' hold of yeh , how much yeh did n't know . Ah , Harry , I don ' know if I 'm the right person ter tell yeh - but someone 's gotta - yeh ca n't go off ter Hogwarts not knowin ' . ;Hagrid;Dumbledore;0.0952380952381;944;27
 Well , it 's best yeh know as much as I can tell yeh - mind , I ca n't tell yeh everythin ' , it 's a great myst'ry , parts of it ... ;Hagrid;Harry,Vernon,Petunia,Dursley;0.666666666667;946;27
"He sat down , stared into the fire for a few seconds , and then said , "" It begins , I suppose , with - with a person called - but it 's incredible yeh do n't know his name , everyone in our world knows - """;Hagrid;Hagrid,Vernon,Petunia,Dursley;0.181481481481;947;27
 Who ? ;Harry;Harry,Vernon,Petunia,Dursley;0.0;948;27
 Well - I don ' like sayin ' the name if I can help it . No one does . ;Hagrid;Hagrid,Vernon,Petunia,Dursley;0.0;949;27
 Why not ? ;Harry;Harry,Vernon,Petunia,Dursley;0.0;950;27
 Gulpin ' gargoyles , Harry , people are still scared . Blimey , this is difficult . See , there was this wizard who went ...bad . As bad as you could go . Worse . Worse than worse . His name was ... ;Hagrid;Hagrid,Harry,Petunia,Dursley;-0.48;951;27
 Could you write it down ?  Harry suggested .;Harry;Hagrid,Vernon,Petunia,Dursley;-0.155555555556;953;27
 Nah - ca n't spell it . All right - Voldemort .  Hagrid shuddered .;Hagrid;Harry,Vernon,Petunia,Dursley;0.285714285714;954;27
 Don ' make me say it again . Anyway , this - this wizard , about twenty years ago now , started lookin ' fer followers . Got ' em , too - some were afraid , some just wanted a bit o ' his power , ' cause he was gettin ' himself power , all right . Dark days , Harry . Did n't know who ter trust , did n't dare get friendly with strange wizards or witches...terrible things happened . He was takin ' over . ' Course , some stood up to him - an ' he killed ' em . Horribly . One o ' the only safe places left was Hogwarts . Reckon Dumbledore 's the only one You-Know-Who was afraid of . Did n't dare try takin ' the school , not jus ' then , anyway .;Harry;Don,Hogwarts;-0.112662337662;955;27
 Now , yer mum an ' dad were as good a witch an ' wizard as I ever knew . Head boy an ' girl at Hogwarts in their day ! Suppose the myst'ry is why You-Know-Who never tried to get ' em on his side before...probably knew they were too close ter Dumbledore ter want anythin ' ter do with the Dark Side .;Hagrid;Headless,You-Know-Who;0.3625;956;27
 Maybe he thought he could persuade ' em...maybe he just wanted ' em outta the way . All anyone knows is , he turned up in the village where you was all living , on Halloween ten years ago . You was just a year old . He came ter yer house an ' - an ' - ;Hagrid;Harry,Vernon,Petunia,Dursley;0.05;957;27
 Sorry ,  he said .;Harry;Hagrid,Vernon,Petunia,Dursley;-0.5;959;27
 But it 's that sad - knew yer mum an ' dad , an ' nicer people yeh could n't find - anyway ...;Hagrid;Harry,Vernon,Petunia,Dursley;-0.5;960;27
" You-Know-Who killed ' em . An ' then - an ' this is the real myst'ry of the thing - he tried to kill you , too . Wanted ter make a clean job of it , I suppose , or maybe he just liked killin ' by then . But he could n't do it . Never wondered how you got that mark on yer forehead ? That was no ordinary cut . That 's what yeh get when a powerful , evil curse touches yeh - took care of yer mum an ' dad an ' yer house , even - but it did n't work on you , an ' that 's why yer famous , Harry . No one ever lived after he decided ter kill ' em , no one except you , an ' he 'd killed some o ' the best witches an ' wizards of the age - the McKinnons , the Bones , the Prewetts - an ' you was only a baby , an ' you lived .

" Now , you listen here , boy ,  he snarled , "" I accept there 's something strange about you , probably nothing a good beating would n't have cured - and as for all this about your parents , well , they were weirdoes , no denying it , and the world 's better off without them in my opinion - asked for all they got , getting mixed up with these wizarding types - just what I expected , always knew they 'd come to a sticky end - """;Hagrid;Harry,Vernon,Petunia,Dursley;0.21;970;27

 That 's better ,  said Hagrid , breathing heavily and sitting back down on the sofa , which this time sagged right down to the floor .;Hagrid;Harry,Vernon,Petunia,Dursley;0.0457671957672;974;27
 But what happened to Vol - , sorry - I mean , You-Know-Who ? ;Harry;Hagrid,Vernon,Petunia,Dursley;-0.40625;976;27
 Good question , Harry . Disappeared . Vanished . Same night he tried ter kill you . Makes yeh even more famous . That 's the biggest myst'ry , see...he was gettin ' more an ' more powerful - why 'd he go ?;Hagrid;Harry,Vernon,Petunia,Dursley;0.428571428571;977;27
 Some say he died . Codswallop , in my opinion . Dunno if he had enough human left in him to die . Some say he 's still out there , bidin ' his time , like , but I don ' believe it . People who was on his side came back ter ours . Some of ' em came outta kinda trances . Don ' reckon they could 've done if he was comin ' back .;Hagrid;Hagrid,Vernon,Petunia,Dursley;0.0;978;27
 Most of us reckon he 's still out there somewhere but lost his powers . Too weak to carry on . ' Cause somethin ' about you finished him , Harry . There was somethin ' goin ' on that night he had n't counted on - I dunno what it was , no one does - but somethin ' about you stumped him , all right . ;Hagrid;Harry,Vernon,Petunia,Dursley;0.136904761905;979;27

 Be grateful if yeh did n't mention that ter anyone at Hogwarts ,  he said .;Hagrid;Hagrid,Vernon,Petunia,Dursley;0.0;1010;27

 Why are n't you supposed to do magic ?  asked Harry .;Harry;Hagrid,Vernon,Petunia,Dursley;0.5;1012;27
 Oh , well - I was at Hogwarts meself but I - er - got expelled , ter tell yeh the truth . In me third year . They snapped me wand in half an ' everything . But Dumbledore let me stay on as gamekeeper . Great man , Dumbledore . ;Hagrid;Dumbledore;0.211111111111;1013;27

 Don ' mind if it wriggles a bit , I think I still got a couple o ' doormice in one o ' the pockets . ;Hagrid;Harry,Vernon,Petunia,Dursley;0.0;1019;27

 There 's an owl - ;Harry;Harry;0.0;1047;28
 Pay him ,  Hagrid grunted into the sofa .;Hagrid;Harry;0.0;1048;28
 What ? ;Harry;Harry;0.0;1049;28
 He wants payin ' fer deliverin ' the paper . Look in the pockets . ;Hagrid;Harry;0.2;1050;28
 Give him five Knuts ,  said Hagrid sleepily .;Hagrid;Knuts;0.0;1052;28
 Knuts ? ;Harry;Harry;0.0;1053;28
 The little bronze ones . ;Hagrid;Hagrid;-0.1875;1054;28
 Best be off , Harry , lots ter do today , gotta get up ter London an ' buy all yer stuff fer school . ;Hagrid;Harry;1.0;1058;28
 Um - Hagrid ? ;Harry;Harry;0.0;1061;28
 Mm ?  said Hagrid , who was pulling on his huge boots .;Hagrid;Harry;0.4;1062;28
 I have n't got any money - and you heard Uncle Vernon last night...he wo n't pay for me to go and learn magic . ;Harry;Vernon;0.25;1063;28
 Do n't worry about that ,  said Hagrid , standing up and scratching his head .;Hagrid;Harry;0.0;1064;28
 D'yeh think yer parents did n't leave yeh anything ? ;Hagrid;Harry;0.0;1065;28
 But if their house was destroyed - ;Harry;Harry;0.0;1066;28
 They didn ' keep their gold in the house , boy ! Nah , first stop fer us is Gringotts . Wizards ' bank . Have a sausage , they 're not bad cold - an ' I wouldn ' say no teh a bit o ' yer birthday cake , neither . ;Hagrid;Gringotts;-3.70074341542e-17;1067;28
 Wizards have banks ? ;Harry;Wizards;0.0;1068;28
 Just the one . Gringotts . Run by goblins . ;Hagrid;Hagrid;0.0;1069;28
 Goblins ? ;Harry;Harry;0.0;1071;28
 Yeah - so yeh 'd be mad ter try an ' rob it , I 'll tell yeh that . Never mess with goblins , Harry . Gringotts is the safest place in the world fer anything yeh want ter keep safe - ' cept maybe Hogwarts . As a matter o ' fact , I gotta visit Gringotts anyway . Fer Dumbledore . Hogwarts business .  Hagrid drew himself up proudly .;Hagrid;Gringotts;0.190625;1072;28

 Got everythin ' ? Come on , then . ;Hagrid;Harry;0.0;1074;28
 How did you get here ?  Harry asked , looking around for another boat .;Harry;Hagrid;0.0;1078;28
 Flew ,  said Hagrid .;Hagrid;Harry;0.0;1079;28
 Flew ? ;Harry;Harry;0.0;1080;28
 Yeah - but we 'll go back in this . Not s'pposed ter use magic now I 've got yeh . ;Hagrid;Harry;0.25;1081;28
 Seems a shame ter row , though ,  said Hagrid , giving Harry another of his sideways looks .;Hagrid;Harry;0.0;1083;28
 If I was ter - er - speed things up a bit , would yeh mind not mentionin ' it at Hogwarts ? ;Hagrid;Harry;0.0;1084;28
 Of course not ,  said Harry , eager to see more magic .;Harry;Hagrid;0.5;1085;28
 Why would you be mad to try and rob Gringotts ?  Harry asked .;Harry;Gringotts;-0.625;1087;28
 Spells - enchantments ,  said Hagrid , unfolding his newspaper as he spoke .;Hagrid;Harry;0.0;1088;28
 They say there 's dragons guardin ' the high security vaults . And then yeh gotta find yer way - Gringotts is hundreds of miles under London , see . Deep under the Underground . Yeh 'd die of hunger tryin ' ter get out , even if yeh did manage ter get yer hands on summat . ;Hagrid;Gringotts;0.08;1089;28
 Ministry o ' Magic messin ' things up as usual ,  Hagrid muttered , turning the page .;Hagrid;Harry;0.125;1092;28
 There 's a Ministry of Magic ?  Harry asked , before he could stop himself .;Harry;Ministry;0.5;1093;28
 ' Course ,  said Hagrid .;Hagrid;Harry;0.0;1094;28
 They wanted Dumbledore fer Minister , o ' course , but he 'd never leave Hogwarts , so old Cornelius Fudge got the job . Bungler if ever there was one . So he pelts Dumbledore with owls every morning , askin ' fer advice . ;Hagrid;Fudge,Hogwarts;0.1;1095;28
 But what does a Ministry of Magic do ? ;Harry;Magic;0.5;1096;28
 Well , their main job is to keep it from the Muggles that there 's still witches an ' wizards up an ' down the country . ;Hagrid;Harry;0.00555555555556;1097;28
 Why ? ;Harry;Harry;0.0;1098;28
 Why ? Blimey , Harry , everyone 'd be wantin ' magic solutions to their problems . Nah , we 're best left alone . ;Hagrid;Harry;0.5;1099;28
"Not only was Hagrid twice as tall as anyone else , he kept pointing at perfectly ordinary things like parking meters and saying loudly , "" See that , Harry ? Things these Muggles dream up , eh ? """;Hagrid;Harry;-0.05;1104;28
" Hagrid ,  said Harry , panting a bit as he ran to keep up , "" did you say there are dragons at Gringotts ? """;Harry;Hagrid;0.0;1105;28
 Well , so they say ,  said Hagrid .;Hagrid;Harry;0.0;1106;28
 Crikey , I 'd like a dragon . ;Hagrid;Harry;0.0;1107;28
 You 'd like one ? ;Harry;Harry;0.0;1108;28
 Wanted one ever since I was a kid - here we go . ;Hagrid;Harry;0.0;1109;28
"Hagrid , who did n't understand "" Muggle money , "" as he called it , gave the bills to Harry so he could buy their tickets .";Hagrid;Harry;0.0;1112;28
 Still got yer letter , Harry ?  he asked as he counted stitches .;Hagrid;Harry;0.0;1115;28
 Good ,  said Hagrid .;Hagrid;Harry;0.7;1117;28
 There 's a list there of everything yeh need . ;Hagrid;Harry;0.0;1118;28
 Can we buy all this in London ?  Harry wondered aloud .;Harry;Hagrid;0.0;1155;29
 If yeh know where to go ,  said Hagrid .;Hagrid;Harry;0.0;1156;29
 I do n't know how the Muggles manage without magic ,  he said as they climbed a broken-down escalator that led up to a bustling road lined with shops .;Hagrid;Muggle;0.5;1161;30
" This is it ,  said Hagrid , coming to a halt , "" the Leaky Cauldron . It 's a famous place . """;Hagrid;;0.5;1169;30
"Everyone seemed to know Hagrid  ,  they waved and smiled at him , and the bartender reached for a glass , saying , "" The usual , Hagrid ? """;;Harry,Diggle,Quirrell,Hags,Apothecary;0.175;1181;31

 So proud , Mr. Potter , I 'm just so proud . ;;Hagrid,Diggle,Quirrell,Hags,Apothecary;0.8;1194;31
 Always wanted to shake your hand - I 'm all of a flutter . ;;Harry,Diggle,Quirrell,Hags,Apothecary;0.0;1195;31
 Delighted , Mr. Potter , just ca n't tell you , Diggle 's the name , Dedalus Diggle . ;Diggle;Hagrid,Harry,Diggle,Hags,Apothecary;0.7;1196;31
 I 've seen you before !  said Harry , as Dedalus Diggle 's top hat fell off in his excitement .;Harry;Hagrid,Diggle,Quirrell,Hags,Apothecary;0.5;1197;31
 You bowed to me once in a shop . ;Harry;Harry,Diggle,Quirrell,Hags,Apothecary;0.0;1198;31
 He remembers !  cried Dedalus Diggle , looking around at everyone .;Diggle;Hagrid,Harry,Quirrell,Hags,Apothecary;0.0;1199;31
 Did you hear that ? He remembers me !  Harry shook hands again and again - Doris Crockford kept coming back for more .;;Hagrid,Diggle,Quirrell,Hags,Apothecary;0.25;1200;31
 Professor Quirrell !  said Hagrid .;Hagrid;Harry,Diggle,Quirrell,Hags,Apothecary;0.0;1203;31
 Harry , Professor Quirrell will be one of your teachers at Hogwarts . ;Hagrid;Quirrell;0.0;1204;31

 What sort of magic do you teach , Professor Quirrell ? ;Harry;Harry,Diggle,Quirrell,Hags,Apothecary;0.5;1206;31

 N-not that you n-need it , eh , P-P-Potter ?  He laughed nervously .;Quirrell;Harry,Diggle,Quirrell,Hags,Apothecary;0.7;1208;31
 You 'll be g-getting all your equipment , I suppose ? I 've g-got to p-pick up a new b-book on vampires , m-myself .  He looked terrified at the very thought .;Quirrell;Hagrid,Diggle,Quirrell,Hags,Apothecary;0.168181818182;1209;31
 Must get on - lots ter buy . Come on , Harry . ;Hagrid;Hagrid,Harry,Diggle,Hags,Apothecary;0.0;1213;31
 Told yeh , did n't I ? Told yeh you was famous . Even Professor Quirrell was tremblin ' ter meet yeh - mind you , he 's usually tremblin ' . ;Hagrid;Quirrell;0.125;1216;31
 Is he always that nervous ? ;Harry;Hagrid,Diggle,Quirrell,Hags,Apothecary;0.0;1217;31
 Oh , yeah . Poor bloke . Brilliant mind . He was fine while he was studyin ' outta books but then he took a year off ter get some firsthand experience....They say he met vampires in the Black Forest , and there was a nasty bit o ' trouble with a hag - never been the same since . Scared of the students , scared of his own subject - now , where 's me umbrella ? ;Hagrid;Hagrid,Harry,Diggle,Quirrell,Apothecary;-0.00185185185185;1218;31
 Three up...two across ...  he muttered .;Hagrid;Harry,Diggle,Quirrell,Hags,Apothecary;0.0;1223;31
 Right , stand back , Harry . ;Hagrid;Hagrid,Diggle,Quirrell,Hags,Apothecary;0.142857142857;1224;31

" Look ,  Harry heard one of them say , "" the new Nimbus Two Thousand - fastest ever - "" There were shops selling robes , shops selling telescopes and strange silver instruments Harry had never seen before , windows stacked with barrels of bat spleens and eels ' eyes , tottering piles of spell books , quills , and rolls of parchment , potion bottles , globes of the moon ...";;Hagrid,Diggle,Quirrell,Hags,Apothecary;0.0431818181818;1239;31
 Gringotts ,  said Hagrid .;Hagrid;Harry,Diggle,Quirrell,Hags,Apothecary;0.0;1240;31
 Yeah , that 's a goblin ,  said Hagrid quietly as they walked up the white stone steps toward him .;Hagrid;Harry,Diggle,Quirrell,Hags,Apothecary;0.0;1243;31
 Like I said , Yeh 'd be mad ter try an ' rob it ,  said Hagrid .;Hagrid;Yeh;-0.625;1257;32
 Morning ,  said Hagrid to a free goblin .;Hagrid;Harry;0.4;1262;32
 We 've come ter take some money outta Mr. Harry Potter 's safe . ;Hagrid;Harry;0.5;1263;32
 You have his key , sir ? ;;Harry;0.0;1264;32
 Got it here somewhere ,  said Hagrid , and he started emptying his pockets onto the counter , scattering a handful of moldy dog biscuits over the goblin 's book of numbers .;Hagrid;Harry;0.0;1265;32
 Got it ,  said Hagrid at last , holding up a tiny golden key .;Hagrid;Harry;0.75;1268;32
 That seems to be in order . ;;Harry;0.0;1270;32
 An ' I 've also got a letter here from Professor Dumbledore ,  said Hagrid importantly , throwing out his chest .;Hagrid;Harry;0.4;1271;32
 It 's about the You-Know-What in vault seven hundred and thirteen . ;Hagrid;Harry;0.0;1272;32
" Very well ,  he said , handing it back to Hagrid , "" I will have someone take you down to both vaults . Griphook ! """;;Harry;0.00185185185185;1274;32
 What 's the You-Know-What in vault seven hundred and thirteen ?  Harry asked .;Harry;Hagrid;0.0;1277;32
 Ca n't tell yeh that ,  said Hagrid mysteriously .;Hagrid;Harry;0.0;1278;32
 Very secret . Hogwarts business . Dumbledore 's trusted me . More'n my job 's worth ter tell yeh that . ;Hagrid;Harry;-0.11;1279;32
" I never know ,  Harry called to Hagrid over the noise of the cart , "" what 's the difference between a stalagmite and a stalactite ? """;Harry;Hagrid,Griphook;0.0;1291;33
 Stalagmite 's got an ' m ' in it ,  said Hagrid .;Hagrid;Harry,Griphook;0.0;1292;33
 An ' don ' ask me questions just now , I think I 'm gonna be sick . ;Hagrid;Harry,Hagrid;-0.714285714286;1293;33
 All yours ,  smiled Hagrid .;Hagrid;Harry,Griphook;0.6;1300;33
 The gold ones are Galleons ,  he explained .;Hagrid;Galleons;0.0;1306;33
 Seventeen silver Sickles to a Galleon and twenty-nine Knuts to a Sickle , it 's easy enough . Right , that should be enough fer a couple o ' terms , we 'll keep the rest safe for yeh .  He turned to Griphook .;Hagrid;Harry,Griphook;0.24380952381;1307;33
 Vault seven hundred and thirteen now , please , and can we go more slowly ? ;Hagrid;Hagrid,Griphook;0.1;1308;33
 One speed only ,  said Griphook .;Griphook;Harry,Hagrid;0.0;1309;33
 Stand back ,  said Griphook importantly .;Griphook;Harry,Hagrid;0.2;1314;33
 If anyone but a Gringotts goblin tried that , they 'd be sucked through the door and trapped in there ,  said Griphook .;Griphook;Gringotts;-0.2;1316;33
 How often do you check to see if anyone 's inside ?  Harry asked .;Harry;Hagrid,Griphook;0.0;1317;33
 About once every ten years ,  said Griphook with a rather nasty grin .;Griphook;Harry,Hagrid;-0.5;1318;33
 Come on , back in this infernal cart , and do n't talk to me on the way back , it 's best if I keep me mouth shut ,  said Hagrid .;Hagrid;Harry,Griphook;0.333333333333;1323;33
 Might as well get yer uniform ,  said Hagrid , nodding toward Madam Malkin 's Robes for All Occasions .;Hagrid;Harry;0.0;1328;34
 Listen , Harry , would yeh mind if I slipped off fer a pick-me-up in the Leaky Cauldron ? I hate them Gringotts carts .  He did still look a bit sick , so Harry entered Madam Malkin 's shop alone , feeling nervous .;Hagrid;Gringotts;-0.757142857143;1329;34
 Hogwarts , dear ?  she said , when Harry started to speak .;;Hagrid;0.0;1331;34
 Got the lot here - another young man being fitted up just now , in fact . ;;Harry;0.1;1332;34
" Hello ,  said the boy , "" Hogwarts , too ? """;Malfoy;Harry;0.0;1335;34
 Yes ,  said Harry .;Harry;Hagrid;0.0;1336;34
 My father 's next door buying my books and mother 's up the street looking at wands ,  said the boy .;Malfoy;Harry;0.0;1337;34
 Then I 'm going to drag them off to took at racing brooms . I do n't see why first years ca n't have their own . I think I 'll bully father into getting me one and I 'll smuggle it in somehow . ;Malfoy;Hagrid;0.25;1339;34
 Have you got your own broom ?  the boy went on .;Malfoy;Harry;0.6;1341;34
 No ,  said Harry .;Harry;Hagrid;0.0;1342;34
 Play Quidditch at all ? ;Malfoy;Harry;0.0;1343;34
 No ,  Harry said again , wondering what on earth Quidditch could be .;Harry;Hagrid;0.0;1344;34
 I do - Father says it 's a crime if I 'm not picked to play for my house , and I must say , I agree . Know what house you 'll be in yet ? ;Malfoy;Fat;0.0;1345;34
 No ,  said Harry , feeling more stupid by the minute .;Harry;Hagrid;-0.15;1346;34
 Well , no one really knows until they get there , do they , but I know I 'll be in Slytherin , all our family have been - imagine being in Hufflepuff , I think I 'd leave , would n't you ? ;Malfoy;Harry;0.2;1347;34
 Mmm ,  said Harry , wishing he could say something a bit more interesting .;Harry;Hagrid;0.5;1348;34
 I say , look at that man !  said the boy suddenly , nodding toward the front window .;Malfoy;Harry;0.0;1349;34
 That 's Hagrid ,  said Harry , pleased to know something the boy did n't .;Harry;Hagrid;0.5;1351;34
 He works at Hogwarts . ;Harry;Harry;0.0;1352;34
" Oh ,  said the boy , "" I 've heard of him . He 's a sort of servant , is n't he ? """;Malfoy;Harry;0.0;1353;34
 He 's the gamekeeper ,  said Harry .;Harry;Hagrid;0.0;1354;34
 Yes , exactly . I heard he 's a sort of savage - lives in a hut on the school grounds and every now and then he gets drunk , tries to do magic , and ends up setting fire to his bed . ;Malfoy;Harry;0.0375;1356;34
 I think he 's brilliant ,  said Harry coldly .;Harry;Hagrid;0.15;1357;34
 Do you ?  said the boy , with a slight sneer .;Malfoy;Harry;-0.166666666667;1358;34
 Why is he with you ? Where are your parents ? ;Malfoy;Harry;0.0;1359;34
 They 're dead ,  said Harry shortly .;Harry;Hagrid;-0.1;1360;34
 Oh , sorry ,  said the other , not sounding sorry at all .;Malfoy;Harry;-0.375;1362;34
 But they were our kind , were n't they ? ;Malfoy;Harry;0.6;1363;34
 They were a witch and wizard , if that 's what you mean . ;Harry;Harry;-0.3125;1364;34
 I really do n't think they should let the other sort in , do you ? They 're just not the same , they 've never been brought up to know our ways . Some of them have never even heard of Hogwarts until they get the letter , imagine . I think they should keep it in the old wizarding families . What 's your surname , anyway ? ;Malfoy;Harry;-0.03125;1365;34
"But before Harry could answer , Madam Malkin said , "" That 's you done , my dear , "" and Harry , not sorry for an excuse to stop talking to the boy , hopped down from the footstool .";;Hagrid;0.0148148148148;1366;34
 Well , I 'll see you at Hogwarts , I suppose ,  said the drawling boy .;Malfoy;Harry;0.0;1367;34
 What 's up ?  said Hagrid .;Hagrid;Harry;0.0;1369;34
 Nothing ,  Harry lied .;Harry;Hagrid;0.0;1370;34
"When they had left the shop , he said , "" Hagrid , what 's Quidditch ? """;Harry;Quidditch;0.0;1373;34
 Blimey , Harry , I keep forgettin ' how little yeh know - not knowin ' about Quidditch ! ;Hagrid;Harry;-0.234375;1374;34
 Do n't make me feel worse ,  said Harry .;Harry;Hagrid;-0.4;1375;34
 - and he said people from Muggle families should n't even be allowed in - ;Harry;Harry;0.0;1377;34
 Yer not from a Muggle family . If he 'd known who yeh were - he 's grown up knowin ' yer name if his parents are wizardin ' folk . You saw what everyone in the Leaky Cauldron was like when they saw yeh . Anyway , what does he know about it , some o ' the best I ever saw were the only ones with magic in ' em in a long line o ' Muggles - look at yer mum ! Look what she had fer a sister ! ;Hagrid;Cauldron;0.35546875;1378;34
 So what is Quidditch ? ;Harry;Quidditch;0.0;1379;34
 It 's our sport . Wizard sport . It 's like - like soccer in the Muggle world - everyone follows Quidditch - played up in the air on broomsticks and there 's four balls - sorta hard ter explain the rules . ;Hagrid;Harry;-0.291666666667;1380;34
 And what are Slytherin and Hufflepuff ? ;Harry;Slytherin;0.0;1381;34
 School houses . There 's four . Everyone says Hufflepuff are a lot o ' duffers , but - ;Hagrid;Hufflepuff;0.0;1382;34
 I bet I 'm in Hufflepuff ,  said Harry gloomily .;Harry;Hagrid;0.0;1383;34
 Better Hufflepuff than Slytherin ,  said Hagrid darkly .;Hagrid;Harry;0.175;1384;34
 There 's not a single witch or wizard who went bad who was n't in Slytherin . You-Know-Who was one . ;Hagrid;You-Know-Who;-0.332142857143;1385;34
 Vol - , sorry - You-Know-Who was at Hogwarts ? ;Harry;You-Know-Who;-0.5;1386;34
 Years an ' years ago ,  said Hagrid .;Hagrid;Harry;0.0;1387;34
 I was trying to find out how to curse Dudley . ;Harry;Harry;0.0;1391;34
 I 'm not sayin ' that 's not a good idea , but yer not ter use magic in the Muggle world except in very special circumstances ,  said Hagrid .;Hagrid;Harry;0.204761904762;1392;34
 An ' anyway , yeh couldn ' work any of them curses yet , yeh 'll need a lot more study before yeh get ter that level . ;Hagrid;Harry;0.5;1393;34
"Hagrid would n't let Harry buy a solid gold cauldron , either ( "" It says pewter on yer list "" ) , but they got a nice set of scales for weighing potion ingredients and a collapsible brass telescope .";Hagrid;Harry;0.3;1394;34
 Just yer wand left - A yeah , an ' I still have n't got yeh a birthday present . ;Hagrid;Harry;0.0;1399;34
 You do n't have to - ;Harry;Hagrid;0.0;1401;34
 I know I do n't have to . Tell yeh what , I 'll get yer animal . Not a toad , toads went outta fashion years ago , yeh 'd be laughed at - an ' I don ' like cats , they make me sneeze . I 'll get yer an owl . All the kids want owls , they 're dead useful , carry yer mail an ' everythin ' . ;Hagrid;Harry;0.266666666667;1402;34
 Don ' mention it ,  said Hagrid gruffly .;Hagrid;Don;0.0;1406;34
 Don ' expect you 've had a lotta presents from them Dursleys . Just Ollivanders left now - only place fer wands , Ollivanders , and yeh gotta have the best wand . ;Hagrid;Ollivander;0.333333333333;1407;34
 Good afternoon ,  said a soft voice .;Ollivander;Harry,Ollivander;0.4;1416;35
 Hello ,  said Harry awkwardly .;Harry;Hagrid,Ollivander;-0.6;1420;35
 Ah yes ,  said the man .;Ollivander;Harry,Ollivander;0.0;1421;35
 Yes , yes . I thought I 'd be seeing you soon . Harry Potter .  It was n't a question .;Ollivander;Harry,Hagrid;0.0;1422;35
 You have your mother 's eyes . It seems only yesterday she was in here herself , buying her first wand . Ten and a quarter inches long , swishy , made of willow . Nice wand for charm work . ;Ollivander;Hagrid,Ollivander;0.16;1423;35
 Your father , on the other hand , favored a mahogany wand . Eleven inches . Pliable . A little more power and excellent for transfiguration . Well , I say your father favored it - it 's really the wand that chooses the wizard , of course . ;Ollivander;Harry,Ollivander;0.426785714286;1427;35
 And that 's where ... ;Harry;Hagrid,Ollivander;0.0;1430;35
 I 'm sorry to say I sold the wand that did it ,  he said softly .;Ollivander;Harry,Ollivander;-0.2;1432;35
 Thirteen-and-a-half inches . Yew . Powerful wand , very powerful , and in the wrong hands...well , if I 'd known what that wand was going out into the world to do ... ;Ollivander;Hagrid,Ollivander;0.0633333333333;1433;35
 Rubeus ! Rubeus Hagrid ! How nice to see you again....Oak , sixteen inches , rather bendy , was n't it ? ;Ollivander;Harry,Hagrid;0.6;1435;35
 It was , sir , yes ,  said Hagrid .;Hagrid;Harry,Ollivander;0.0;1436;35
 Good wand , that one . But I suppose they snapped it in half when you got expelled ?  said Mr. Ollivander , suddenly stern .;Ollivander;Harry,Hagrid;0.177777777778;1437;35
 Er - yes , they did , yes ,  said Hagrid , shuffling his feet .;Hagrid;Harry,Ollivander;0.0;1438;35
 I 've still got the pieces , though ,  he added brightly .;Hagrid;Hagrid,Ollivander;0.7;1439;35
 But you do n't use them ?  said Mr. Ollivander sharply .;Ollivander;Harry,Hagrid;-0.125;1440;35
 Oh , no , sir ,  said Hagrid quickly .;Hagrid;Harry,Ollivander;0.333333333333;1441;35
 Hmmm ,  said Mr. Ollivander , giving Hagrid a piercing look .;Ollivander;Harry,Hagrid;0.0;1443;35
 Well , now - Mr. Potter . Let me see .  He pulled a long tape measure with silver markings out of his pocket .;Ollivander;Hagrid,Ollivander;-0.05;1444;35
 Which is your wand arm ? ;Ollivander;Harry,Ollivander;0.0;1445;35
 Er - well , I 'm right-handed ,  said Harry .;Harry;Hagrid,Ollivander;0.0;1446;35
 Hold out your arm . That 's it .  He measured Harry from shoulder to finger , then wrist to elbow , shoulder to floor , knee to armpit and round his head .;Ollivander;Hagrid,Ollivander;-0.2;1447;35
"As he measured , he said , "" Every Ollivander wand has a core of a powerful magical substance , Mr. Potter . We use unicorn hairs , phoenix tail feathers , and the heartstrings of dragons . No two Ollivander wands are the same , just as no two unicorns , dragons , or phoenixes are quite the same . And of course , you will never get such good results with another wizard 's wand . """;Ollivander;Ollivander;0.25;1448;35
 That will do ,  he said , and the tape measure crumpled into a heap on the floor .;Ollivander;Harry,Hagrid;0.0;1451;35
 Right then , Mr. Potter . Try this one . Beechwood and dragon heartstring . Nine inches . Nice and flexible . just take it and give it a wave . ;Ollivander;Harry,Ollivander;0.442857142857;1452;35
 Maple and phoenix feather . Seven inches . Quite whippy . Try - ;Ollivander;Quite;0.0;1454;35
 No , no - here , ebony and unicorn hair , eight and a half inches , springy . Go on , go on , try it out . ;Ollivander;Harry,Ollivander;-0.166666666667;1456;35
 Tricky customer , eh ? Not to worry , we 'll find the perfect match here somewhere - I wonder , now - yes , why not - unusual combination - holly and phoenix feather , eleven inches , nice and supple . ;Ollivander;Hagrid,Ollivander;0.5;1461;35
"Hagrid whooped and clapped and Mr. Ollivander cried , "" Oh , bravo ! Yes , indeed , oh , very good . Well , well , well...how curious...how very curious ... """;Ollivander;Harry,Ollivander;0.39;1465;35
"He put Harry 's wand back into its box and wrapped it in brown paper , still muttering , "" Curious...curious ...";Ollivander;Hagrid,Ollivander;0.0;1466;35
" Sorry ,  said Harry , "" but what 's curious ? """;Harry;Hagrid,Ollivander;-0.3;1467;35
 I remember every wand I 've ever sold , Mr. Potter . Every single wand . It so happens that the phoenix whose tail feather is in your wand , gave another feather - just one other . It is very curious indeed that you should be destined for this wand when its brother - why , its brother gave you that scar . ;Ollivander;Harry,Ollivander;-0.10880952381;1469;35
 Yes , thirteen-and-a-half inches . Yew . Curious indeed how these things happen . The wand chooses the wizard , remember...I think we must expect great things from you , Mr. Potter....After all , He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named did great things - terrible , yes , but great . ;Ollivander;He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named;0.26;1471;35
 Got time fer a bite to eat before yer train leaves ,  he said .;Hagrid;;0.0;1479;36
 You all right , Harry ? Yer very quiet ,  said Hagrid .;Hagrid;;0.142857142857;1483;36
 Everyone thinks I 'm special ,  he said at last .;Harry;;0.178571428571;1486;36
 All those people in the Leaky Cauldron , Professor Quirrell , Mr. Ollivander...but I do n't know anything about magic at all . How can they expect great things ? I 'm famous and I ca n't even remember what I 'm famous for . I do n't know what happened when Vol - , sorry - I mean , the night my parents died . ;Harry;Ollivander;0.247916666667;1487;36
 Don ' you worry , Harry . You 'll learn fast enough . Everyone starts at the beginning at Hogwarts , you 'll be just fine . Just be yerself . I know it 's hard . Yeh 've been singled out , an ' that 's always hard . But yeh 'll have a great time at Hogwarts - I did - still do , ' smatter of fact . ;Hagrid;Yeh;0.138888888889;1490;36
 Yer ticket fer Hogwarts ,  he said .;Hagrid;;0.0;1492;36
 First o ' September - King 's Cross - it 's all on yer ticket . Any problems with the Dursleys , send me a letter with yer owl , she 'll know where to find me....See yeh soon , Harry . ;Hagrid;;0.125;1493;36
 Er - Uncle Vernon ? ;Harry;Harry;0.0;1513;37
 Er - I need to be at King 's Cross tomorrow to - to go to Hogwarts . ;Harry;Harry;0.0;1515;37
 Would it be all right if you gave me a lift ? ;Harry;Harry;0.285714285714;1517;37
 Thank you . ;Harry;Harry;0.0;1520;37
 Funny way to get to a wizards ' school , the train . Magic carpets all got punctures , have they ? ;Vernon;Harry;0.375;1522;37
 Where is this school , anyway ? ;Vernon;Harry;0.0;1524;37
 I do n't know ,  said Harry , realizing this for the first time .;Harry;Vernon;0.25;1525;37
 I just take the train from platform nine and three-quarters at eleven o'clock ,  he read .;Harry;Harry;0.0;1527;37
 Platform what ? ;Vernon;Harry;0.0;1529;37
 Nine and three-quarters . ;Harry;Harry;0.0;1530;37
 Do n't talk rubbish ,  said Uncle Vernon .;Vernon;Harry;0.0;1531;37
 There is no platform nine and three-quarters . ;Vernon;Harry;0.0;1532;37
 It 's on my ticket . ;Harry;Harry;0.0;1533;37
" Barking ,  said Uncle Vernon , "" howling mad , the lot of them . You 'll see . You just wait . All right , we 'll take you to King 's Cross . We 're going up to London tomorrow anyway , or I would n't bother . """;Vernon;Harry;-0.113095238095;1534;37
 Why are you going to London ?  Harry asked , trying to keep things friendly .;Harry;Vernon;0.375;1535;37
 Taking Dudley to the hospital ,  growled Uncle Vernon .;Vernon;Dudley;0.0;1536;37
 Got to have that ruddy tail removed before he goes to Smeltings . ;Vernon;Got;0.0;1537;37
 Well , there you are , boy . Platform nine - platform ten . Your platform should be somewhere in the middle , but they do n't seem to have built it yet , do they ? ;Vernon;;0.0;1546;38
 Have a good term ,  said Uncle Vernon with an even nastier smile .;Vernon;;0.5;1549;38
 - packed with Muggles , of course - ;;;0.0;1566;39
 Now , what 's the platform number ?  said the boys ' mother .;;;0.0;1572;39
" Nine and three-quarters !  piped a small girl , also red-headed , who was holding her hand , "" Mom , ca n't I go ... """;;;-0.25;1573;39
 You 're not old enough , Ginny , now be quiet . All right , Percy , you go first . ;;;0.0971428571429;1574;39
 Fred , you next ,  the plump woman said .;;;0.0;1577;39
 I 'm not Fred , I 'm George ,  said the boy .;George;George;0.0;1578;39
 Honestly , woman , you call yourself our mother ? Ca n't you tell I 'm George ? ;George;George;0.6;1579;39
 Sorry , George , dear . ;;;-0.5;1580;39
 Only joking , I am Fred ,  said the boy , and off he went .;Fred;Fred;0.0;1581;39
 Excuse me ,  Harry said to the plump woman .;Harry;;-0.05;1585;39
 Hello , dear ,  she said .;;;0.0;1586;39
 First time at Hogwarts ? Ron 's new , too . ;;;0.193181818182;1587;39
 Yes ,  said Harry .;Harry;;0.0;1590;39
 The thing is - the thing is , I do n't know how to - ;Harry;;0.0;1591;39
 How to get onto the platform ?  she said kindly , and Harry nodded .;;;0.6;1592;39
 Not to worry ,  she said .;;;0.0;1593;39
 All you have to do is walk straight at the barrier between platforms nine and ten . Do n't stop and do n't be scared you 'll crash into it , that 's very important . Best do it at a bit of a run if you 're nervous . Go on , go now before Ron . ;;Best;0.43;1594;39
 Er - okay ,  said Harry .;Harry;;0.5;1595;39
"He passed a round-faced boy who was saying , "" Gran , I 've lost my toad again . """;Neville;Ron,Percy;0.0;1610;40
 Oh , Neville ,  he heard the old woman sigh .;;Harry,Percy;0.1;1611;40
 Give us a look , Lee , go on . ;;Ron,Percy;0.0;1613;40
 Want a hand ?  It was one of the red-haired twins he 'd followed through the barrier .;;Harry,Percy;0.0;1618;40
 Yes , please ,  Harry panted .;Harry;Ron,Percy;0.0;1619;40
 Oy , Fred ! C ' mere and help ! ;;Harry,Percy;-0.625;1620;40
 Thanks ,  said Harry , pushing his sweaty hair out of his eyes .;Harry;Ron,Percy;0.2;1622;40
 What 's that ?  said one of the twins suddenly , pointing at Harry 's lightning scar .;;Ron,Percy;0.0;1623;40
 Blimey ,  said the other twin .;;Harry,Percy;-0.125;1624;40
 Are you - ? ;;Ron,Percy;0.0;1625;40
 He is ,  said the first twin .;;Harry,Percy;0.25;1626;40
 Are n't you ?  he added to Harry .;;Ron,Percy;0.0;1627;40
 What ?  said Harry .;Harry;Ron,Percy;0.0;1628;40
 Harry Potter .  chorused the twins .;;Harry,Percy;0.0;1629;40
 Oh , him ,  said Harry .;Harry;Ron,Percy;0.0;1630;40
 I mean , yes , I am . ;Harry;Harry,Percy;-0.3125;1631;40
 Fred ? George ? Are you there ? ;;Ron,Percy;0.0;1634;40
 Coming , Mom . ;;Harry,Percy;0.0;1635;40
 Ron , you 've got something on your nose . ;;Ron,Percy;0.0;1639;40
 Mom - geroff  He wriggled free .;Ron;Harry,Percy;0.4;1641;40
 Aaah , has ickle Ronnie got somefink on his nosie ?  said one of the twins .;;Ron;0.0;1642;40
 Shut up ,  said Ron .;Ron;Harry,Percy;0.0;1643;40
 Where 's Percy ?  said their mother .;;Harry,Ron;0.0;1644;40
 He 's coming now . ;;Ron,Percy;0.0;1645;40
 Ca n't stay long , Mother ,  he said .;Percy;Harry,Percy;-0.05;1648;40
 I 'm up front , the prefects have got two compartments to themselves - ;Percy;Ron,Percy;0.0;1649;40
 Oh , are you a prefect , Percy ?  said one of the twins , with an air of great surprise .;;Harry,Percy;0.8;1650;40
 You should have said something , we had no idea . ;;Ron,Percy;0.0;1651;40
 Hang on , I think I remember him saying something about it ,  said the other twin .;;Harry,Percy;-0.125;1652;40
 Once - ;;Ron,Percy;0.0;1653;40
 Or twice - ;;Harry,Percy;0.0;1654;40
 A minute - ;;Ron,Percy;0.0;1655;40
 All summer - ;;Harry,Percy;0.0;1656;40
 Oh , shut up ,  said Percy the Prefect .;Percy;Harry,Ron;0.0;1657;40
 How come Percy gets new robes , anyway ?  said one of the twins .;;Percy;0.136363636364;1658;40
 Because he 's a prefect ,  said their mother fondly .;;Harry,Percy;0.0;1659;40
 All right , dear , well , have a good term - send me an owl when you get there . ;;Harry,Ron;0.492857142857;1660;40
 Now , you two - this year , you behave yourselves . If I get one more owl telling me you 've - you 've blown up a toilet or - ;;Ron,Percy;0.233333333333;1663;40
 Blown up a toilet ? We 've never blown up a toilet . ;;Harry,Percy;-0.0333333333333;1664;40
 Great idea though , thanks , Mom . ;;Ron,Percy;0.5;1665;40
 It 's not funny . And look after Ron . ;;Harry,Percy;-0.125;1666;40
 Do n't worry , ickle Ronniekins is safe with us . ;;Ron,Percy;0.5;1667;40
 Shut up ,  said Ron again .;Ron;Harry,Percy;0.0;1668;40
 Hey , Mom , guess what ? Guess who we just met on the train ? ;;Harry,Ron;0.0;1670;40
 You know that black-haired boy who was near us in the station ? Know who he is ? ;;Ron,Percy;0.1;1672;40
 Who ? ;;Harry,Percy;0.0;1673;40
 Harry Potter ! ;;Ron,Percy;0.0;1674;40
 Oh , Mom , can I go on the train and see him , Mom , eh please ... ;Ginny;Harry,Percy;0.0;1676;40
 You 've already seen him , Ginny , and the poor boy is n't something you goggle at in a zoo . Is he really , Fred ? How do you know ? ;;Ron,Percy;-0.1;1677;40
 Asked him . Saw his scar . It 's really there - like lightning . ;;Harry,Percy;0.2;1678;40
 Poor dear - no wonder he was alone , I wondered . He was ever so polite when he asked how to get onto the platform . ;;Ron,Percy;-0.4;1679;40
 Never mind that , do you think he remembers what You-Know-Who looks like ? ;;You-Know-Who;0.0;1680;40
 I forbid you to ask him , Fred . No , do n't you dare . As though he needs reminding of that on his first day at school . ;;Ron,Percy;0.25;1682;40
 All right , keep your hair on . ;;Harry,Percy;0.285714285714;1683;40
 Hurry up !  their mother said , and the three boys clambered onto the train .;;Ron,Percy;0.0;1685;40
 Do n't , Ginny , we 'll send you loads of owls . ;;Harry,Percy;0.0;1687;40
 We 'll send you a Hogwarts ' toilet seat . ;;Hogwarts;-0.0333333333333;1688;40
 George ! ;;Harry,Percy;0.0;1689;40
 Only joking , Mom . ;;Harry,Ron;0.0;1690;40
 Anyone sitting there ?  he asked , pointing at the seat opposite Harry .;Ron;Ron,Percy;0.0;1698;40
 Everywhere else is full . ;Ron;Harry,Percy;0.35;1699;40
 Hey , Ron . ;;Ron,Percy;0.0;1703;40
 Listen , we 're going down the middle of the train - Lee Jordan 's got a giant tarantula down there . ;;Harry,Ron;-0.0777777777778;1705;40
 Right ,  mumbled Ron .;Ron;Harry,Percy;0.285714285714;1706;40
" Harry ,  said the other twin , "" did we introduce ourselves ? Fred and George Weasley . And this is Ron , our brother . See you later , then . """;;Ron;-0.0625;1707;40
 Bye ,  said Harry and Ron .;Harry;Ron,Percy;0.0;1708;40
 Are you really Harry Potter ?  Ron blurted out .;Ron;Harry;0.2;1710;40
 Oh - well , I thought it might be one of Fred and George 's jokes ,  said Ron .;Ron;Harry,Percy;0.0;1712;40
 And have you really got - you know ... ;Ron;Ron,Percy;0.2;1713;40
 So that 's where You-Know-Who - ? ;Ron;Harry,Percy;0.0;1717;40
" Yes ,  said Harry , "" but I ca n't remember it . """;Harry;Ron,Percy;0.0;1718;40
 Nothing ?  said Ron eagerly .;Ron;Harry,Percy;0.0;1719;40
 Well - I remember a lot of green light , but nothing else . ;Harry;Ron,Percy;0.1;1720;40
 Wow ,  said Ron .;Ron;Harry,Percy;0.1;1721;40
 Are all your family wizards ?  asked Harry , who found Ron just as interesting as Ron found him .;Harry;Harry,Percy;0.5;1723;40
 Er - Yes , I think so ,  said Ron .;Ron;Harry,Percy;0.0;1724;40
 I think Mom 's got a second cousin who 's an accountant , but we never talk about him . ;Ron;Ron,Percy;0.0;1725;40
 So you must know loads of magic already . ;Harry;Harry,Ron;0.5;1726;40
 I heard you went to live with Muggles ,  said Ron .;Ron;Harry,Percy;0.136363636364;1728;40
 What are they like ? ;Ron;Ron,Percy;0.0;1729;40
 Horrible - well , not all of them . My aunt and uncle and cousin are , though . Wish I 'd had three wizard brothers . ;Harry;Harry,Ron;-1.0;1730;40
 Five ,  said Ron .;Ron;Harry,Percy;0.0;1731;40
 I 'm the sixth in our family to go to Hogwarts . You could say I 've got a lot to live up to . Bill and Charlie have already left - Bill was head boy and Charlie was captain of Quidditch . Now Percy 's a prefect . Fred and George mess around a lot , but they still get really good marks and everyone thinks they 're really funny . Everyone expects me to do as well as the others , but if I do , it 's no big deal , because they did it first . You never get anything new , either , with five brothers . I 've got Bill 's old robes , Charlie 's old wand , and Percy 's old rat . ;Ron;Charlie,Bill;0.145247933884;1733;40
 His name 's Scabbers and he 's useless , he hardly ever wakes up . Percy got an owl from my dad for being made a prefect , but they could n't aff - I mean , I got Scabbers instead . ;Ron;Scabbers,Percy;-0.368055555556;1735;40
 ...and until Hagrid told me , I did n't know anything about being a wizard or about my parents or Voldemort - ;Harry;Hagrid;0.0;1741;40
 What ?  said Harry .;Harry;Ron,Percy;0.0;1743;40
 You said You-Know-Who 's name !  said Ron , sounding both shocked and impressed .;Ron;You-Know-Who;0.15;1744;40
 I 'd have thought you , of all people - ;Ron;Harry,Ron;0.0;1745;40
" I 'm not trying to be brave or anything , saying the name ,  said Harry , "" I just never knew you should n't . See what I mean ? I 've got loads to learn....I bet , "" he added , voicing for the first time something that had been worrying him a lot lately , "" I bet I 'm the worst in the class . """;Harry;Ron,Percy;-0.1125;1746;40
 You wo n't be . There 's loads of people who come from Muggle families and they learn quick enough . ;Ron;Harry,Percy;0.166666666667;1747;40
"Around half past twelve there was a great clattering outside in the corridor and a smiling , dimpled woman slid back their door and said , "" Anything off the cart , dears ? """;;Ron,Percy;0.0766666666667;1751;40
 Hungry , are you ? ;;Harry,Percy;0.0;1759;40
 Starving ,  said Harry , taking a large bite out of a pumpkin pasty .;Harry;Ron,Percy;0.214285714286;1760;40
"He pulled one of them apart and said , "" She always forgets I do n't like corned beef . . """;Ron;Harry,Percy;0.0;1763;40
 Swap you for one of these ,  said Harry , holding up a pasty .;Harry;Ron,Percy;0.0;1764;40
 Go on - ;Harry;Harry,Ron;0.0;1765;40
 You do n't want this , it 's all dry ,  said Ron .;Ron;Harry,Percy;-0.0666666666667;1766;40
" She has n't got much time ,  he added quickly , "" you know , with five of us . """;Ron;Harry,Ron;0.266666666667;1767;40
 Go on , have a pasty ,  said Harry , who had never had anything to share before or , indeed , anyone to share it with .;Harry;Ron,Percy;0.0;1768;40
 What are these ?  Harry asked Ron , holding up a pack of Chocolate Frogs .;Harry;Ron,Percy;0.0;1770;40
 They 're not really frogs , are they ?  He was starting to feel that nothing would surprise him .;Harry;Harry,Ron;-0.05;1771;40
 No ,  said Ron .;Ron;Harry,Percy;0.0;1772;40
 But see what the card is . I 'm missing Agrippa . ;Ron;Agrippa;-0.2;1773;40
 What ? ;Harry;Harry,Percy;0.0;1774;40
 Oh , of course , you would n't know - Chocolate Frogs have cards , inside them , you know , to collect - famous witches and wizards . I 've got about five hundred , but I have n't got Agrippa or Ptolemy . ;Ron;Frogs,Agrippa;0.5;1775;40
 So this is Dumbledore !  said Harry .;Harry;Ron,Percy;0.0;1780;40
 Do n't tell me you 'd never heard of Dumbledore !  said Ron .;Ron;Harry,Percy;0.0;1781;40
 Can I have a frog ? I might get Agrippa - thanks - ;Ron;Agrippa;0.2;1782;40
 He 's gone ! ;Harry;Ron,Hogwarts;0.0;1792;41
 Well , you ca n't expect him to hang around all day ,  said Ron .;Ron;Harry,Hogwarts;0.0;1793;41
 He 'll be back . No , I 've got Morgana again and I 've got about six of her...do you want it ? You can start collecting . ;Ron;Morgana;0.0;1794;41
 Help yourself ,  said Harry .;Harry;Ron,Hogwarts;0.0;1796;41
 But in , you know , the Muggle world , people just stay put in photos . ;Ron;Ron,Harry;0.0;1797;41
 Do they ? What , they do n't move at all ?  Ron sounded amazed .;Ron;Harry,Hogwarts;0.0;1798;41
 Weird ! ;Ron;Ron,Hogwarts;-0.625;1799;41
 You want to be careful with those ,  Ron warned Harry .;Ron;Harry,Hogwarts;-0.1;1804;41
 When they say every flavor , they mean every flavor - you know , you get all the ordinary ones like chocolate and peppermint and marmalade , but then you can get spinach and liver and tripe . George reckons he had a booger-flavored one once . ;Ron;George;-0.28125;1805;41
 Bleaaargh - see ? Sprouts . ;Ron;Harry,Hogwarts;0.0;1807;41

 Nothing , that 's why it 's such big news . They have n't been caught .

 The start-of-term banquet will begin shortly , but before you take your seats in the Great Hall , you will be sorted into your houses . The Sorting is a very important ceremony because , while you are here , your house will be something like your family within Hogwarts . You will have classes with the rest of your house , sleep in your house dormitory , and spend free time in your house common room .;McGonagall;McGonagall,Ron;0.284;1984;44
 The four houses are called Gryffindor , Hufflepuff , Ravenclaw , and Slytherin . Each house has its own noble history and each has produced outstanding witches and wizards . While you are at Hogwarts , your triumphs will earn your house points , while any rulebreaking will lose house points . At the end of the year , the house with the most points is awarded the house cup , a great honor . I hope each of you will be a credit to whichever house becomes yours .;McGonagall;Gryffindor;0.6;1985;44

 N-nothing . ;Harry;Harry,Ron,Weasley,Percy,Seamus,Headless,Neville,Hermione;0.0;2223;50
 Who 's that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell ?  he asked Percy .;Harry;Harry,Ron,Weasley,Seamus,Headless,Neville,Hermione,Dumbledore;0.0;2226;50
 Oh , you know Quirrell already , do you ? No wonder he 's looking so nervous , that 's Professor Snape . He teaches Potions , but he does n't want to - everyone knows he 's after Quirrell 's job . Knows an awful lot about the Dark Arts , Snape . ;Percy;Quirrell,Snape;-0.575;2227;50
 Ahem - just a few more words now that we are all fed and watered . I have a few start-of-term notices to give you .;Dumbledore;Harry,Ron,Weasley,Percy,Seamus,Headless,Neville,Hermione;0.0333333333333;2231;50
" First years should note that the forest on the grounds is forbidden to all pupils . And a few of our older students would do well to remember that as well . """;Dumbledore;Harry,Ron,Weasley,Seamus,Headless,Neville,Hermione,Dumbledore;0.0722222222222;2232;50
 I have also been asked by Mr. Filch , the caretaker , to remind you all that no magic should be used between classes in the corridors .;Dumbledore;Harry,Ron,Weasley,Percy,Seamus,Headless,Neville,Hermione;-0.25;2234;50
 Quidditch trials will be held in the second week of the term . Anyone interested in playing for their house teams should contact Madam Hooch .;Dumbledore;Hooch;0.125;2235;50
 And finally , I must tell you that this year , the third-floor corridor on the right-hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a very painful death . ;Dumbledore;Harry,Ron,Weasley,Percy,Seamus,Headless,Neville,Hermione;-0.455;2236;50
 He 's not serious ?  he muttered to Percy .;Harry;Harry,Ron,Weasley,Seamus,Headless,Neville,Hermione,Dumbledore;0.166666666667;2238;50
 Must be ,  said Percy , frowning at Dumbledore .;Percy;Harry,Ron,Weasley,Seamus,Headless,Neville,Hermione,Dumbledore;0.0;2239;50
 It 's odd , because he usually gives us a reason why we 're not allowed to go somewhere - the forest 's full of dangerous beasts , everyone knows that . I do think he might have told us prefects , at least . ;Percy;Ron,Weasley,Percy,Seamus,Headless,Neville,Hermione,Dumbledore;-0.193333333333;2240;50
 And now , before we go to bed , let us sing the school song !  cried Dumbledore .;Dumbledore;Harry,Ron,Weasley,Percy,Seamus,Headless,Neville,Hermione;0.0;2241;50

 Go away , Peeves , or the Baron 'll hear about this , I mean it !  barked Percy .;Percy;Baron;-0.390625;2279;52
 You want to watch out for Peeves ,  said Percy , as they set off again .;Percy;Weasley,Ron;0.0;2282;52
 The Bloody Baron 's the only one who can control him , he wo n't even listen to us prefects . Here we are . ;Percy;Percy,Ron;-0.4;2283;52

 What have we got today ?  Harry asked Ron as he poured sugar on his porridge .;Harry;Ron;0.0;2357;56
 Double Potions with the Slytherins ,  said Ron .;Ron;Harry;0.0;2358;56
 Snape 's Head of Slytherin House . They say he always favors them - we 'll be able to see if it 's true . ;Ron;Ron;0.425;2359;56

 You are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of potionmaking ,  he began .;Snape;Harry,Snape,Hermione,Ron;-0.0416666666667;2389;57
 As there is little foolish wand-waving here , many of you will hardly believe this is magic . I do n't expect you will really understand the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with its shimmering fumes , the delicate power of liquids that creep through human veins , bewitching the mind , ensnaring the senses....I can teach you how to bottle fame , brew glory , even stopper death - if you are n't as big a bunch of dunderheads as I usually have to teach . ;Snape;Snape,Hermione,Ron,Hagrid;0.0882575757576;2391;57
 Potter !  said Snape suddenly .;Snape;Harry,Hermione,Ron,Hagrid;0.0;2395;57
 What would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood ? ;Snape;Harry,Snape,Hermione,Ron;0.0;2396;57
 I do n't know , sir ,  said Harry .;Harry;Snape,Hermione,Ron,Hagrid;0.0;2399;57
 Tut , tut - fame clearly is n't everything . ;Snape;Harry,Snape,Hermione,Ron;-0.05;2401;57

 I do n't know , sir . ;Harry;Harry,Snape,Hermione,Ron;0.0;2406;57
 Thought you would n't open a book before coming , eh , Potter ?  Harry forced himself to keep looking straight into those cold eyes .;Snape;Snape,Hermione,Ron,Hagrid;-0.175;2407;57
 What is the difference , Potter , between monkshood and wolfsbane ? ;Snape;Harry,Snape,Hermione,Ron;0.0;2410;57
 I do n't know ,  said Harry quietly .;Harry;Snape,Hermione,Ron,Hagrid;0.0;2412;57

 Sit down ,  he snapped at Hermione .;Snape;Harry,Snape,Ron,Hagrid;-0.155555555556;2416;57
 For your information , Potter , asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful it is known as the Draught of Living Death . A bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of a goat and it will save you from most poisons . As for monkshood and wolfsbane , they are the same plant , which also goes by the name of aconite . Well ? Why are n't you all copying that down ? ;Snape;Snape,Hermione,Ron,Hagrid;0.161111111111;2417;57
"Over the noise , Snape said , "" And a point will be taken from Gryffindor House for your cheek , Potter . """;Snape;Harry,Hermione,Ron,Hagrid;0.0;2419;57
 Idiot boy !  snarled Snape , clearing the spilled potion away with one wave of his wand .;Snape;Harry,Hermione,Ron,Hagrid;0.0;2426;57
 I suppose you added the porcupine quills before taking the cauldron off the fire ? ;Snape;Snape,Hermione,Ron,Hagrid;0.0;2427;57
 Take him up to the hospital wing ,  Snape spat at Seamus .;Snape;Harry,Hermione,Ron,Hagrid;0.0;2429;57
 You - Potter - why did n't you tell him not to add the quills ? Thought he 'd make you look good if he got it wrong , did you ? That 's another point you 've lost for Gryffindor . ;Snape;Snape,Hermione,Ron,Hagrid;0.1;2431;57
" Do n't push it ,  he muttered , "" I 've heard Snape can turn very nasty . """;Ron;Snape;-1.0;2433;57
" Cheer up ,  said Ron , "" Snape 's always taking points off Fred and George . Can I come and meet Hagrid with you ? """;Ron;Hagrid;0.0;2436;57

 This is Ron ,  Harry told Hagrid , who was pouring boiling water into a large teapot and putting rock cakes onto a plate .;Harry;Ron;0.214285714286;2450;57
 Another Weasley , eh ?  said Hagrid , glancing at Ron 's freckles .;Hagrid;Harry,Snape,Hermione,Ron;0.0;2451;57

" Gran knows I forget things - this tells you if there 's something you 've forgotten to do . Look , you hold it tight like this and if it turns red - oh ...

 Good-bye ,  said Ron .;Ron;Harry,George,Fred,Malfoy;0.0;2699;64
"Ron had spent all evening giving him advice such as "" If he tries to curse you , you 'd better dodge it , because I ca n't remember how to block them . "" There was a very good chance they were going to get caught by Filch or Mrs. Norris , and Harry felt he was pushing his luck , breaking another school rule today .";Ron;Hermione,Harry,Neville;-0.242;2702;65
" Half-past eleven ,  Ron muttered at last , "" we 'd better go . """;Ron;Hermione,Harry,Neville;0.25;2705;65
"They had almost reached the portrait hole when a voice spoke from the chair nearest them , "" I ca n't believe you 're going to do this , Harry . """;Hermione;Ron,Harry,Neville;0.0;2708;65
 You !  said Ron furiously .;Ron;Hermione,Harry,Neville;0.0;2711;65
 Go back to bed ! ;Ron;Ron,Hermione,Harry;0.0;2712;65
" I almost told your brother ,  Hermione snapped , "" Percy - he 's a prefect , he 'd put a stop to this . """;Hermione;Ron,Harry,Neville;0.0;2713;65
 Come on ,  he said to Ron .;Harry;Hermione,Harry,Neville;0.0;2715;65
 Do n't you care about Gryffindor , do you only care about yourselves , I do n't want Slytherin to win the house cup , and you 'll lose all the points I got from Professor McGonagall for knowing about Switching Spells . ;Hermione;Slytherin,Spells;0.4;2719;65
 Go away . ;Ron;Hermione,Harry,Neville;0.0;2720;65
 All right , but I warned you , you just remember what I said when you 're on the train home tomorrow , you 're so - ;Hermione;Ron,Harry,Neville;0.285714285714;2721;65
 Now what am I going to do ?  she asked shrilly .;Hermione;Ron,Hermione,Harry;0.0;2725;65
 That 's your problem ,  said Ron .;Ron;Hermione,Harry,Neville;0.0;2726;65
 We 've got to go , we 're going to be late . ;Ron;Ron,Hermione,Harry;-0.3;2727;65
 I 'm coming with you ,  she said .;Hermione;Ron,Harry,Neville;0.0;2729;65
 You are not . ;Ron;Hermione,Harry,Neville;0.0;2730;65
 D'you think I 'm going to stand out here and wait for Filch to catch me ? If he finds all three of us I 'll tell him the truth , that I was trying to stop you , and you can back me up . ;Hermione;Filch;0.0;2731;65
 You 've got some nerve -  said Ron loudly .;Ron;Hermione,Harry,Neville;0.1;2732;65
 Shut up , both of you !  said Harry sharply .;Harry;Ron,Hermione,Neville;-0.125;2733;65
"Mrs. Norris ? "" breathed Ron , squinting through the dark .";Ron;Hermione,Harry,Neville;-0.15;2737;65
 Thank goodness you found me ! I 've been out here for hours , I could n't remember the new password to get in to bed . ;Neville;Ron,Harry,Neville;0.136363636364;2741;65
 Keep your voice down , Neville . The password 's ' Pig snout ' but it wo n't help you now , the Fat Lady 's gone off somewhere . ;Ron;Hermione,Harry,Neville;-0.155555555556;2742;65
 How 's your arm ?  said Harry .;Harry;Ron,Hermione,Neville;0.0;2743;65
 Fine ,  said Neville , showing them .;Neville;Ron,Hermione,Harry;0.416666666667;2744;65
 Madam Pomfrey mended it in about a minute . ;Neville;Pomfrey;0.0;2745;65
 Good - well , look , Neville , we 've got to be somewhere , we 'll see you later - ;Harry;Ron,Harry,Neville;0.35;2746;65
" Do n't leave me !  said Neville , scrambling to his feet , "" I do n't want to stay here alone , the Bloody Baron 's been past twice already . """;Neville;Ron,Hermione,Harry;-0.525;2747;65
 If either of you get us caught , I 'll never rest until I 've learned that Curse of the Bogies Quirrell told us about , and used it on you . ;Hermione;Quirrell;0.0;2749;65
 He 's late , maybe he 's chickened out ,  Ron whispered .;Ron;Harry,Hermione,Filch,Neville;-0.3;2760;66
 Sniff around , my sweet , they might be lurking in a corner . ;Filch;Ron,Hermione,Filch,Neville;0.35;2763;66
" They 're in here somewhere ,  they heard him mutter , "" probably hiding . """;Filch;Harry,Hermione,Filch,Neville;0.0;2767;66
 This way !  Harry mouthed to the others and , petrified , they began to creep down a long gallery full of suits of armor .;Harry;Ron,Hermione,Filch,Neville;0.0481481481481;2768;66
 RUN !  Harry yelled , and the four of them sprinted down the gallery , not looking back to see whether Filch was following - they swung around the doorpost and galloped down one corridor then another , Harry in the lead , without any idea where they were or where they were going - they ripped through a tapestry and found themselves in a hidden passageway , hurtled along it and came out near their Charms classroom , which they knew was miles from the trophy room .;Harry;Ron,Hermione,Filch,Neville;-0.062962962963;2772;66
 I think we 've lost him ,  Harry panted , leaning against the cold wall and wiping his forehead .;Harry;Ron,Hermione,Filch,Neville;-0.6;2773;66
"I - told - you , "" Hermione gasped , clutching at the stitch in her chest , "" I - told - you .";Hermione;Hermione;0.0;2775;66
"We 've got to get back to Gryffindor tower , "" said Ron , "" quickly as possible . """;Ron;Harry,Hermione,Filch,Neville;0.0;2777;66
 Malfoy tricked you ,  Hermione said to Harry .;Hermione;Malfoy;0.0;2778;66
 You realize that , do n't you ? He was never going to meet you - Filch knew someone was going to be in the trophy room , Malfoy must have tipped him off . ;Hermione;Filch,Malfoy;0.0;2779;66
 Let 's go . ;Harry;Ron,Hermione,Filch,Neville;0.0;2781;66
 Shut up , Peeves - please - you 'll get us thrown out . ;Ron;Harry,Hermione,Filch,Neville;0.0;2786;66
 Wandering around at midnight , Ickle Firsties ? Tut , tut , tut . Naughty , naughty , you 'll get caughty . ;Peeves;Ron,Hermione,Filch,Neville;-0.15;2788;66
 Not if you do n't give us away , Peeves , please . ;Ron;Harry,Hermione,Filch,Neville;0.0;2789;66
 Should tell Filch , I should ,  said Peeves in a saintly voice , but his eyes glittered wickedly .;Peeves;Filch;0.0;2790;66
 It 's for your own good , you know . ;Peeves;Harry,Hermione,Filch,Neville;0.65;2791;66
 Get out of the way ,  snapped Ron , taking a swipe at Peeves this was a big mistake .;Ron;Ron,Hermione,Filch,Neville;0.0;2792;66
" STUDENTS OUT OF BED !  Peeves bellowed , "" STUDENTS OUT OF BED DOWN THE CHARMS CORRIDOR ! """;Peeves;Ron,Harry,Hermione,Neville;-0.194444444444;2793;66
" This is it !  Ron moaned , as they pushed helplessly at the door , "" We 're done for ! This is the end ! """;Ron;Harry,Hermione,Filch,Neville;0.0;2795;66
 Oh , move over ,  Hermione snarled .;Hermione;Ron,Harry,Filch,Neville;0.0;2797;66
 Which way did they go , Peeves ?  Filch was saying .;Filch;Ron,Harry,Hermione,Neville;0.0;2800;66
 Quick , tell me . ;Filch;Ron,Hermione,Filch,Neville;0.333333333333;2801;66
 Say ' please . ' ;Peeves;Say;0.0;2802;66
 Do n't mess with me , Peeves , now where did they go ? ;Filch;Ron,Hermione,Filch,Neville;0.0875;2803;66
 Sha n't say nothing if you do n't say please ,  said Peeves in his annoying singsong voice .;Peeves;Harry,Hermione,Filch,Neville;-0.8;2804;66
 All right - please . ;Filch;Ron,Hermione,Filch,Neville;0.285714285714;2805;66
 NOTHING ! Ha haaa ! Told you I would n't say nothing if you did n't say please ! Ha ha ! Haaaaaa !  And they heard the sound of Peeves whooshing away and Filch cursing in rage .;Peeves;Ron,Harry,Hermione,Neville;0.4;2806;66
 He thinks this door is locked ,  Harry whispered .;Harry;Ron,Hermione,Filch,Neville;0.0;2807;66
 I think we 'll be okay - get off , Neville !  For Neville had been tugging on the sleeve of Harry 's bathrobe for the last minute .;Harry;Ron,Harry,Hermione,Filch;0.3125;2808;66
 What ? ;Harry;Ron,Hermione,Filch,Neville;0.0;2809;66
 Where on earth have you all been ?  she asked , looking at their bathrobes hanging off their shoulders and their flushed , sweaty faces .;;earth;0.0;2824;67
 Never mind that - pig snout , pig snout ,  panted Harry , and the portrait swung forward .;Harry;Ron,Hermione;0.0;2825;67
 What do they think they 're doing , keeping a thing like that locked up in a school ?  said Ron finally .;Ron;Harry,Hermione;0.0;2829;67
 If any dog needs exercise , that one does . ;Harry;Ron,Hermione;0.0;2830;67
 You do n't use your eyes , any of you , do you ?  she snapped .;Hermione;Harry,Ron;0.0;2832;67
 Did n't you see what it was standing on ;Hermione;Harry,Hermione;0.0;2833;67
" The floor ? "" Harry suggested .";Harry;Ron,Hermione;0.0;2834;67
 I was n't looking at its feet , I was too busy with its heads . ;Ron;Harry,Ron;0.1;2835;67
 No , not the floor . It was standing on a trapdoor . It 's obviously guarding something . ;Hermione;Ron,Hermione;0.0;2836;67
 I hope you 're pleased with yourselves . We could all have been killed - or worse , expelled . Now , if you do n't mind , I 'm going to bed . ;Hermione;Harry,Hermione;0.05;2838;67
 No , we do n't mind ,  he said .;Harry;Ron,Hermione;0.0;2840;67
 You 'd think we dragged her along , would n't you .;Ron;Harry,Ron;0.0;2841;67
" It 's either really valuable or really dangerous , "" said Ron .";Ron;Harry;-0.2;2854;68
 Or both ,  said Harry .;Harry;Ron;0.0;2855;68
 A Nimbus Two Thousand !  Ron moaned enviously .;Ron;Harry,Malfoy,Professor;0.0;2873;69
 I 've never even touched one . ;Ron;Ron,Harry,Professor;0.0;2874;69
 That 's a broomstick ,  he said , throwing it back to Harry with a mixture of jealousy and spite on his face .;Malfoy;Ron,Malfoy,Professor;0.0;2877;69
 You 'll be in for it this time , Potter , first years are n't allowed them . ;Malfoy;Ron,Harry,Professor;0.25;2878;69
" It 's not any old broomstick ,  he said , "" it 's a Nimbus Two Thousand . What did you say you 've got at home , Malfoy , a Comet Two Sixty ? "" Ron grinned at Harry .";Ron;Nimbus;0.1;2880;69
 Comets look flashy , but they 're not in the same league as the Nimbus . ;Ron;Ron,Malfoy,Professor;-0.25;2881;69
 What would you know about it , Weasley , you could n't afford half the handle ,  Malfoy snapped back .;Malfoy;Ron,Harry,Professor;-0.0833333333333;2882;69
 I suppose you and your brothers have to save up twig by twig . ;Malfoy;Harry,Malfoy,Professor;0.0;2883;69
 Not arguing , I hope , boys ?  he squeaked .;Professor;Ron,Malfoy,Professor;0.0;2885;69
 Potter 's been sent a broomstick , Professor ,  said Malfoy quickly .;Malfoy;Ron,Harry,Professor;0.333333333333;2886;69
 Yes , yes , that 's right ,  said Professor Flitwick , beaming at Harry .;Professor;Ron,Harry,Malfoy;0.285714285714;2887;69
 Professor McGonagall told me all about the special circumstances , Potter . And what model is it ? ;Professor;McGonagall;0.357142857143;2888;69
 A Nimbus Two Thousand , it is ,  said Harry , fighting not to laugh at the look of horror on Malfoy 's face .;Harry;Ron,Malfoy,Professor;0.3;2889;69
 And it 's really thanks to Malfoy here that I 've got it ,  he added .;Harry;Harry,Malfoy,Professor;0.2;2890;69
" Well , it 's true ,  Harry chortled as they reached the top of the marble staircase , "" If he had n't stolen Neville 's Remembrall I would n't be on the team ... """;Harry;Neville;0.425;2892;69
 So I suppose you think that 's a reward for breaking rules ?  came an angry voice from just behind them .;Hermione;Harry,Malfoy,Professor;-0.45;2893;69
 I thought you were n't speaking to us ?  said Harry .;Harry;Ron,Malfoy,Professor;0.0;2895;69
" Yes , do n't stop now ,  said Ron , "" it 's doing us so much good . """;Ron;Harry,Malfoy,Professor;0.7;2896;69
 Wow ,  Ron sighed , as the broomstick rolled onto Harry 's bedspread .;Ron;Harry,Malfoy,Professor;0.1;2901;69
 Hey , Potter , come down ! ;Wood;Harry;-0.194444444444;2912;70
 Very nice ,  said Wood , his eyes glinting .;Wood;Harry;0.78;2916;70
 I see what McGonagall meant...you really are a natural . I 'm just going to teach you the rules this evening , then you 'll be joining team practice three times a week . ;Wood;Harry;0.15;2917;70
 Right ,  said Wood .;Wood;Harry;0.285714285714;2920;70
 Now , Quidditch is easy enough to understand , even if it 's not too easy to play . There are seven players on each side . Three of them are called Chasers . ;Wood;Quidditch,Chasers;0.288888888889;2921;70
 Three Chasers ,  Harry repeated , as Wood took out a bright red ball about the size of a soccer ball .;Harry;Wood;0.35;2922;70
 This ball 's called the Quaffle ,  said Wood .;Wood;Quaffle;0.0;2923;70
 The Chasers throw the Quaffle to each other and try and get it through one of the hoops to score a goal . Ten points every time the Quaffle goes through one of the hoops . Follow me ? ;Wood;Chasers,Quaffle;-0.0625;2924;70
 The Chasers throw the Quaffle and put it through the hoops to score ,  Harry recited .;Harry;Chasers,Quaffle;0.0;2925;70
 So - that 's sort of like basketball on broomsticks with six hoops , is n't it ? ;Harry;Harry;0.0;2926;70
 What 's basketball ?  said Wood curiously .;Wood;Harry;-0.1;2927;70
 Never mind ,  said Harry quickly .;Harry;Wood;0.333333333333;2928;70
 Now , there 's another player on each side who 's called the Keeper - I 'm Keeper for Gryffindor . I have to fly around our hoops and stop the other team from scoring . ;Wood;Keeper;0.3375;2929;70
 Three Chasers , one Keeper ,  said Harry , who was determined to remember it all .;Harry;Wood;0.0;2930;70
 And they play with the Quaffle . Okay , got that . So what are they for ?  He pointed at the three balls left inside the box .;Wood;Harry;0.25;2931;70
 I 'll show you now ,  said Wood .;Wood;Harry;0.0;2932;70
 Take this . ;Wood;Harry;0.0;2933;70
 I 'm going to show you what the Bludgers do ,  Wood said .;Wood;Bludger;0.0;2935;70
 These two are the Bludgers . ;Wood;Bludger;0.0;2936;70
 Stand back ,  Wood warned Harry .;Wood;Harry;0.0;2939;70
 See ?  Wood panted , forcing the struggling Bludger back into the crate and strapping it down safely .;Wood;Harry;0.114814814815;2943;70
 The Bludgers rocket around , trying to knock players off their brooms . That 's why you have two Beaters on each team - the Weasley twins are ours - it 's their job to protect their side from the Bludgers and try and knock them toward the other team . So - think you 've got all that ? ;Wood;Weasley;-0.125;2944;70
 Three Chasers try and score with the Quaffle  ,  the Keeper guards the goal posts  ,  the Beaters keep the Bludgers away from their team ,  Harry reeled off .;Harry;Keeper,Bludger;0.0;2945;70
 Very good ,  said Wood .;Wood;Harry;0.91;2946;70
 Er - have the Bludgers ever killed anyone ?  Harry asked , hoping he sounded offhand .;Harry;Bludger;0.0;2947;70
 Never at Hogwarts . We 've had a couple of broken jaws but nothing worse than that . Now , the last member of the team is the Seeker . That 's you . And you do n't have to worry about the Quaffle or the Bludgers - ;Wood;Seeker;-0.266666666667;2948;70
 - unless they crack my head open . ;Wood;Harry;0.0;2949;70
 Do n't worry , the Weasleys are more than a match for the Bludgers - I mean , they 're like a pair of human Bludgers themselves . ;Wood;Weasley;0.0625;2950;70
" This ,  said Wood , "" is the Golden Snitch , and it 's the most important ball of the lot . It 's very hard to catch because it 's so fast and difficult to see . It 's the Seeker 's job to catch it . You 've got to weave in and out of the Chasers , Beaters , Bludgers , and Quaffle to get it before the other team 's Seeker , because whichever Seeker catches the Snitch wins his team an extra hundred and fifty points , so they nearly always win . That 's why Seekers get fouled so much . A game of Quidditch only ends when the Snitch is caught , so it can go on for ages - I think the record is three months , they had to keep bringing on substitutes so the players could get some sleep .";Wood;Quaffle,Snitch,Seeker;0.0919871794872;2954;70
 Well , that 's it any questions ? ;Wood;Harry;0.0;2955;70
" We wo n't practice with the Snitch yet ,  said Wood , carefully shutting it back inside the crate , "" it 's too dark , we might lose it . Let 's try you out with a few of these . """;Wood;Harry;-0.1125;2958;70
 That Quidditch Cup 'll have our name on it this year ,  said Wood happily as they trudged back up to the castle .;Wood;Harry;0.4;2962;70
 I would n't be surprised if you turn out better than Charlie Weasley , and he could have played for England if he had n't gone off chasing dragons . ;Wood;Harry;0.3;2963;70
 Now , do n't forget that nice wrist movement we 've been practicing !  squeaked Professor Flitwick , perched on top of his pile of books as usual .;Professor;Harry,Ron,Hermione,Dumbledore;0.333333333333;2975;71
 Swish and flick , remember , swish and flick . And saying the magic words properly is very important , too - never forget Wizard Baruffio , who said ' s ' instead of ' f ' and found himself on the floor with a buffalo on his chest . ;Professor;Wizards;0.51;2976;71
 Wingardium Leviosa !  he shouted , waving his long arms like a windmill .;Ron;Harry,Ron,Hermione,Dumbledore;-0.05;2981;71
 You 're saying it wrong ,  Harry heard Hermione snap .;Hermione;Professor,Ron,Hermione,Dumbledore;-0.5;2982;71
 It 's Wing-gar-dium Levi-o-sa , make the ' gar ' nice and long . ;Hermione;Levi-o-sa;0.275;2983;71
 You do it , then , if you 're so clever ,  Ron snarled .;Ron;Professor,Harry,Hermione,Dumbledore;0.166666666667;2984;71
"Hermione rolled up the sleeves of her gown , flicked her wand , and said , "" Wingardium Leviosa ! """;Hermione;Professor,Harry,Ron,Dumbledore;0.0;2985;71
 Oh , well done !  cried Professor Flitwick , clapping .;Professor;Harry,Ron,Hermione,Dumbledore;0.0;2987;71
 Everyone see here , Miss Granger 's done it ! ;Professor;Professor,Harry,Hermione,Dumbledore;0.0;2988;71
" It 's no wonder no one can stand her ,  he said to Harry as they pushed their way into the crowded corridor , "" she 's a nightmare , honestly . """;Ron;Professor,Ron,Hermione,Dumbledore;0.6;2990;71
 I think she heard you . ;Harry;Harry,Ron,Hermione,Dumbledore;0.0;2994;71
 So ?  said Ron , but he looked a bit uncomfortable .;Ron;Professor,Harry,Hermione,Dumbledore;-0.5;2995;71
 She must 've noticed she 's got no friends . ;Ron;Professor,Ron,Hermione,Dumbledore;0.0;2996;71
"Everyone stared as he reached Professor Dumbledore 's chair , slumped against the table , and gasped , "" Troll - in the dungeons - thought you ought to know . """;Quirrell;Professor,Harry,Ron,Hermione;0.0;3003;71
" Prefects ,  he rumbled , "" lead your Houses back to the dormitories immediately ! """;Dumbledore;Professor,Harry,Hermione,Dumbledore;0.0;3007;71
 Follow me ! Stick together , first years ! No need to fear the troll if you follow my orders ! Stay close behind me , now . Make way , first years coming through ! Excuse me , I 'm a prefect ! ;Percy;Harry,Ron,Hermione,Dumbledore;0.06015625;3009;71
 How could a troll get in ?  Harry asked as they climbed the stairs .;Harry;Professor,Ron,Hermione,Dumbledore;0.0;3010;71
 Do n't ask me , they 're supposed to be really stupid ,  said Ron .;Ron;Professor,Harry,Hermione,Dumbledore;-0.8;3011;71
 Maybe Peeves let it in for a Halloween joke . ;Ron;Professor,Ron,Hermione,Dumbledore;0.0;3012;71
 I 've just thought - Hermione . ;Harry;Professor,Harry,Hermione,Dumbledore;0.0;3015;71
 What about her ? ;Ron;Professor,Ron,Hermione,Dumbledore;0.0;3016;71
 She does n't know about the troll . ;Harry;Professor,Harry,Hermione,Dumbledore;0.0;3017;71
 Oh , all right ,  he snapped .;Ron;Professor,Ron,Hermione,Dumbledore;0.285714285714;3019;71
 But Percy 'd better not see us . ;Ron;Percy;0.5;3020;71
 Percy !  hissed Ron , pulling Harry behind a large stone griffin .;Ron;Professor,Harry,Hermione,Dumbledore;-0.0928571428571;3023;71
 What 's he doing ?  Harry whispered .;Harry;Professor,Ron,Hermione,Dumbledore;0.0;3026;71
 Why is n't he down in the dungeons with the rest of the teachers ? ;Harry;Professor,Harry,Hermione,Dumbledore;-0.155555555556;3027;71
 Search me . ;Ron;Harry,Ron,Hermione,Dumbledore;0.0;3028;71
 He 's heading for the third floor ,  Harry said , but Ron held up his hand .;Harry;Professor,Ron,Hermione,Dumbledore;0.0;3030;71
 Can you smell something ? ;Ron;Professor,Harry,Hermione,Dumbledore;0.0;3031;71
 The keys in the lock ,  Harry muttered .;Harry;Ron,Hermione,McGonagall;0.0;3043;72
 We could lock it in . ;Harry;Harry,Ron,Hermione;0.0;3044;72
 Good idea ,  said Ron nervously .;Ron;Harry,Hermione,McGonagall;0.7;3045;72
 Yes ! ;Harry;Ron,Hermione,McGonagall;0.0;3048;72
 Oh , no ,  said Ron , pale as the Bloody Baron .;Ron;Harry,Hermione,McGonagall;-0.505;3050;72
 It 's the girls ' bathroom !  Harry gasped .;Harry;Ron,Hermione,McGonagall;0.0;3051;72
 Hermione !  they said together .;Ron;Harry,Hermione,McGonagall;0.0;3052;72
 Confuse it !  Harry said desperately to Ron , and , seizing a tap , he threw it as hard as he could against the wall .;Harry;Ron,Hermione,McGonagall;-0.445833333333;3058;72
 Oy , pea-brain !  yelled Ron from the other side of the chamber , and he threw a metal pipe at it .;Ron;Harry,Hermione,McGonagall;-0.125;3063;72
 Come on , run , run !  Harry yelled at Hermione , trying to pull her toward the door , but she could n't move , she was still flat against the wall , her mouth open with terror .;Harry;Ron,Hermione,McGonagall;-0.0125;3065;72
 Is it - dead ? ;Hermione;Harry,Hermione,McGonagall;-0.2;3078;72
 I do n't think so ,  said Harry , I think it 's just been knocked out .;Harry;Ron,Hermione,McGonagall;0.0;3079;72
"Urgh - troll boogers . """;Ron;Harry,Ron,Hermione;0.0;3083;72
 What on earth were you thinking of ?  said Professor McGonagall , with cold fury in her voice .;McGonagall;earth;-0.6;3094;73
 You 're lucky you were n't killed . Why are n't you in your dormitory ? ;McGonagall;McGonagall,Ron,Harry;0.333333333333;3096;73
 Please , Professor McGonagall - they were looking for me . ;Hermione;McGonagall,Harry,Hermione;0.0;3101;73
 Miss Granger ! ;McGonagall;Ron,Harry,Hermione;0.0;3102;73
 I went looking for the troll because I - I thought I could deal with it on my own - you know , because I 've read all about them . ;Hermione;McGonagall,Harry,Hermione;0.6;3104;73
 If they had n't found me , I 'd be dead now . Harry stuck his wand up its nose and Ron knocked it out with its own club . They did n't have time to come and fetch anyone . It was about to finish me off when they arrived . ;Hermione;Harry;0.2;3107;73

 What 's all this noise ? ;Weasley;Ron,Harry,Fred,George,Percy;0.0;3568;88
 P for prefect ! Get it on , Percy , come on , we 're all wearing ours , even Harry got one . ;George;Harry;0.0;3571;88
 I - do n't - want -  said Percy thickly , as the twins forced the sweater over his head , knocking his glasses askew .;Percy;Ron,Harry,Fred,George,Weasley;-0.233333333333;3572;88
 And you 're not sitting with the prefects today , either ,  said George .;George;Ron,Harry,Fred,Weasley,Percy;0.0;3573;88
 Christmas is a time for family . ;George;Christmas;0.0;3574;88
 Who 's there ?  squawked the Fat Lady .;Fat;;0.0;3611;89
 You asked me to come directly to you , Professor , if anyone was wandering around at night , and somebody 's been in the library Restricted Section . ;Filch;Section;0.1;3644;90
"Wherever he was , Filch must know a shortcut , because his soft , greasy voice was getting nearer , and to his horror , it was Snape who replied , "" The Restricted Section ? Well , they ca n't be far , we 'll catch them . """;Snape;;0.1;3646;90
 Mom ?  he whispered .;Harry;;0.0;3682;91
 Dad ? ;Harry;;0.0;3683;91
"He tore his eyes away from his mother 's face , whispered , "" I 'll come back , "" and hurried from the room .";Harry;;0.0;3691;91
 You could have woken me up ,  said Ron , crossly .;Ron;;0.0;3693;92
 You can come tonight , I 'm going back , I want to show you the mirror .;Harry;;0.0;3694;92
" I 'd like to see your mom and dad , "" Ron said eagerly .";Ron;;0.0;3695;92
 And I want to see all your family , all the Weasleys , you 'll be able to show me your other brothers and everyone . ;Harry;;0.1875;3696;92
 You can see them any old time ,  said Ron .;Ron;;0.1;3697;92
 Just come round my house this summer . Anyway , maybe it only shows dead people . Shame about not finding Flamel , though . Have some bacon or something , why are n't you eating anything ? ;Ron;Flamel;-0.133333333333;3698;92
 Are you all right ?  said Ron .;Ron;;0.285714285714;3705;92
 You look odd . ;Ron;;-0.166666666667;3706;92
 I 'm freezing ,  said Ron .;Ron;Harry;0.0;3711;93
 Let 's forget it and go back . ;Ron;Harry;0.0;3712;93
 No !  Harry hissed .;Harry;Ron;0.0;3713;93
"It 's here - just here - yes ! """;Ron;Harry;0.0;3718;93
 See ?  Harry whispered .;Harry;Ron;0.0;3723;93
 I ca n't see anything . ;Ron;Harry;0.0;3724;93
 Look ! Look at them all...there are loads of them ... ;Harry;Harry;0.0;3725;93
 I can only see you . ;Ron;Harry;0.0;3726;93
 Look in it properly , go on , stand where I am . ;Harry;Harry;0.0;3727;93
 Look at me !  he said .;Ron;Harry;0.0;3730;93
 Can you see all your family standing around you ? ;Harry;Harry;0.0;3731;93
 No - I 'm alone - but I 'm different - I look older - and I 'm head boy ! ;Ron;Harry;0.104166666667;3732;93
 What ? ;Harry;Harry;0.0;3733;93
 I am - I 'm wearing the badge like Bill used to - and I 'm holding the house cup and the Quidditch cup - I 'm Quidditch captain , too . ;Ron;Bill;0.0;3734;93
 Do you think this mirror shows the future ? ;Ron;Harry;0.0;3736;93
 How can it ? All my family are dead - let me have another look - ;Harry;Harry;-0.2;3737;93
 You had it to yourself all last night , give me a bit more time . ;Ron;Harry;0.25;3738;93
 You 're only holding the Quidditch cup , what 's interesting about that ? I want to see my parents . ;Harry;Harry;0.25;3739;93
 Do n't push me - ;Ron;Harry;0.0;3740;93
 Quick ! ;Ron;Harry;0.416666666667;3743;93
 This is n't safe - she might have gone for Filch , I bet she heard us . Come on . ;Ron;Harry;-0.25;3747;93
 Want to play chess , Harry ?  said Ron .;Ron;;0.0;3751;94
 No . ;Harry;;0.0;3752;94
 Why do n't we go down and visit Hagrid ? ;Ron;;-0.155555555556;3753;94
 No...you go ... ;Harry;;0.0;3754;94
 I know what you 're thinking about , Harry , that mirror . Do n't go back tonight . ;Ron;;0.0;3755;94
 Why not ? ;Harry;;0.0;3756;94
 I dunno , I 've just got a bad feeling about it - and anyway , you 've had too many close shaves already . Filch , Snape , and Mrs. Norris are wandering around . So what if they ca n't see you ? What if they walk into you ? What if you knock something over ? ;Ron;Norris;-0.1;3757;94
 You sound like Hermione . ;Harry;;0.4;3758;94
 I 'm serious , Harry , do n't go . ;Ron;;-0.333333333333;3759;94
 So - back again , Harry ? ;Dumbledore;Dumbledore;0.0;3769;95
 I - I did n't see you , sir . ;Harry;Dumbledore;0.0;3774;95
 Strange how nearsighted being invisible can make you ,  said Dumbledore , and Harry was relieved to see that he was smiling .;Dumbledore;Dumbledore;-0.05;3775;95
" So ,  said Dumbledore , slipping off the desk to sit on the floor with Harry , "" you , like hundreds before you , have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised . """;Dumbledore;Harry;-0.1;3776;95
 I did n't know it was called that , Sir . ;Harry;Dumbledore;0.0;3777;95
 But I expect you 've realized by now what it does ? ;Dumbledore;Dumbledore;0.0;3778;95
 It - well - it shows me my family - ;Harry;Dumbledore;0.0;3779;95
 And it showed your friend Ron himself as head boy . ;Dumbledore;Ron;0.0;3780;95
 How did you know - ? ;Harry;Dumbledore;0.0;3781;95
 I do n't need a cloak to become invisible ,  said Dumbledore gently .;Dumbledore;Harry;0.2;3782;95
 Now , can you think what the Mirror of Erised shows us all ? ;Dumbledore;Dumbledore;0.0;3783;95
 Let me explain . The happiest man on earth would be able to use the Mirror of Erised like a normal mirror , that is , he would look into it and see himself exactly as he is . Does that help ? ;Dumbledore;earth,Mirror;0.3;3785;95
"Then he said slowly , "" It shows us what we want...whatever we want ... """;Harry;Dumbledore;-0.3;3787;95
 Yes and no ,  said Dumbledore quietly .;Dumbledore;Harry;0.0;3788;95
 It shows us nothing more or less than the deepest , most desperate desire of our hearts . You , who have never known your family , see them standing around you . Ronald Weasley , who has always been overshadowed by his brothers , sees himself standing alone , the best of all of them . However , this mirror will give us neither knowledge or truth . Men have wasted away before it , entranced by what they have seen , or been driven mad , not knowing if what it shows is real or even possible .;Dumbledore;Dumbledore;0.0675925925926;3789;95
" The Mirror will be moved to a new home tomorrow , Harry , and I ask you not to go looking for it again . If you ever do run across it , you will now be prepared . It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live , remember that . Now , why do n't you put that admirable cloak back on and get off to bed ? """;Dumbledore;Mirror;0.0909090909091;3790;95
 Sir - Professor Dumbledore ? Can I ask you something ? ;Harry;Dumbledore;0.0;3792;95
 Obviously , you 've just done so ,  Dumbledore smiled .;Dumbledore;Harry;0.3;3793;95
 You may ask me one more thing , however . ;Dumbledore;Dumbledore;0.5;3794;95
 What do you see when you look in the mirror ? ;Harry;Dumbledore;0.0;3795;95
 I ? I see myself holding a pair of thick , woolen socks . ;Dumbledore;Dumbledore;-0.3;3796;95
 One can never have enough socks ,  said Dumbledore .;Dumbledore;Harry;0.0;3798;95
 Another Christmas has come and gone and I did n't get a single pair . People will insist on giving me books . ;Dumbledore;Christmas;-0.0714285714286;3799;95
 You see , Dumbledore was right , that mirror could drive you mad ,  said Ron , when Harry told him about these dreams .;Ron;Dumbledore;-0.169642857143;3811;96
 Will you stop messing around !  he yelled .;Wood;Weasley,Harry,Hermione,Ron,Neville;0.0;3824;97
 That 's exactly the sort of thing that 'll lose us the match ! Snape 's refereeing this time , and he 'll be looking for any excuse to knock points off Gryffindor ! ;Wood;Wood,Weasley,Hermione,Ron,Neville;0.125;3825;97
 Snape 's refereeing ?  he spluttered through a mouthful of mud .;Weasley;Wood,Harry,Hermione,Ron,Neville;0.0;3827;97
 When 's he ever refereed a Quidditch match ? He 's not going to be fair if we might overtake Slytherin . ;Weasley;Slytherin;0.7;3828;97
 It 's not my fault ,  said Wood .;Wood;Weasley,Harry,Hermione,Ron,Neville;0.0;3830;97
 We 've just got to make sure we play a clean game , so Snape has n't got an excuse to pick on us . ;Wood;Wood,Weasley,Harry,Hermione,Neville;0.104166666667;3831;97
" Do n't talk to me for a moment ,  said Ron when Harry sat down next to him , "" I need to concen - "" He caught sight of Harry 's face .";Ron;Wood,Weasley,Hermione,Ron,Neville;-0.0777777777778;3835;97
 What 's the matter with you ? You look terrible . ;Ron;Wood,Weasley,Harry,Hermione,Neville;-1.0;3836;97
 Do n't play ,  said Hermione at once .;Hermione;Wood,Weasley,Harry,Ron,Neville;0.0;3838;97
 Say you 're ill ,  said Ron .;Ron;Wood,Weasley,Harry,Hermione,Neville;-0.5;3839;97
 Pretend to break your leg ,  Hermione suggested .;Hermione;Wood,Weasley,Harry,Ron,Neville;0.0;3840;97
 Really break your leg ,  said Ron .;Ron;Wood,Weasley,Harry,Hermione,Neville;0.2;3841;97
 I ca n't ,  said Harry .;Harry;Wood,Weasley,Hermione,Ron,Neville;0.0;3842;97
 There is n't a reserve Seeker . If I back out , Gryffindor ca n't play at all . ;Harry;Gryffindor;0.0;3843;97
 What happened ?  Hermione asked him , leading him over to sit with Harry and Ron .;Hermione;Wood,Weasley,Harry,Ron,Neville;0.0;3849;97
 Malfoy ,  said Neville shakily .;Neville;Wood,Weasley,Harry,Hermione,Ron;-0.333333333333;3850;97
 I met him outside the library . He said he 'd been looking for someone to practice that on . ;Neville;Wood,Weasley,Hermione,Ron,Neville;0.0;3851;97
 Go to Professor McGonagall !  Hermione urged Neville .;Hermione;Wood,Weasley,Harry,Ron,Neville;0.0;3852;97
 Report him ! ;Hermione;Wood,Weasley,Hermione,Ron,Neville;0.0;3853;97
 I do n't want more trouble ,  he mumbled .;Neville;Wood,Weasley,Harry,Ron,Neville;0.15;3855;97
 You 've got to stand up to him , Neville !  said Ron .;Ron;Wood,Weasley,Harry,Hermione,Neville;0.0;3856;97
 He 's used to walking all over people , but that 's no reason to lie down in front of him and make it easier . ;Ron;Wood,Weasley,Hermione,Ron,Neville;-0.155555555556;3857;97
 There 's no need to tell me I 'm not brave enough to be in Gryffindor , Malfoy 's already done that ,  Neville choked out .;Neville;Wood,Weasley,Harry,Hermione,Ron;-0.2;3858;97
 You 're worth twelve of Malfoy ,  Harry said .;Harry;Wood,Weasley,Hermione,Ron,Neville;0.3;3861;97
 The Sorting Hat chose you for Gryffindor , did n't it ? And where 's Malfoy ? In stinking Slytherin . ;Harry;Hat,Slytherin;0.0;3862;97
 Thanks , Harry...I think I 'll go to bed....D'you want the card , you collect them , do n't you ? ;Neville;Harry;0.2;3864;97
" Dumbledore again ,  he said , "" He was the first one I ever - """;Harry;Wood,Weasley,Harry,Ron,Neville;0.25;3866;97
 I 've found him !  he whispered .;Harry;Wood,Weasley,Harry,Hermione,Neville;0.0;3870;97
 I 've found Flamel ! I told you I 'd read the name somewhere before , I read it on the train coming here - listen to this : ' Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945 , for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon 's blood , and his work on alchemy with his partner , Nicolas Flamel ' ! ;Harry;Dumbledore;0.15625;3871;97
 Stay there !  she said , and she sprinted up the stairs to the girls ' dormitories .;Hermione;Wood,Weasley,Hermione,Ron,Neville;0.0;3874;97
 I never thought to look in here !  she whispered excitedly .;Hermione;Wood,Weasley,Harry,Hermione,Neville;0.375;3876;97
 I got this out of the library weeks ago for a bit of light reading . ;Hermione;Wood,Weasley,Hermione,Ron,Neville;0.4;3877;97
 Light ?  said Ron , but Hermione told him to be quiet until she 'd looked something up , and started flicking frantically through the pages , muttering to herself .;Ron;Wood,Weasley,Harry,Ron,Neville;0.2;3878;97
 I knew it ! I knew it ! ;Hermione;Wood,Weasley,Hermione,Ron,Neville;0.0;3880;97
 Are we allowed to speak yet ?  said Ron grumpily .;Ron;Wood,Weasley,Harry,Hermione,Neville;0.0;3881;97
" Nicolas Flamel ,  she whispered dramatically , "" is the only known maker of the Sorcerer 's Stone ! """;Hermione;Wood,Weasley,Harry,Ron,Neville;0.0;3883;97
 The what ?  said Harry and Ron .;Harry;Wood,Weasley,Hermione,Ron,Neville;0.0;3885;97
 Oh , honestly , do n't you two read ? Look â€“ read that , there . ;Hermione;Wood,Weasley,Harry,Hermione,Neville;-0.3;3886;97
 See ?  said Hermione , when Harry and Ron had finished .;Hermione;Ron;0.0;3895;98
 The dog must be guarding Flamel 's Sorcerer 's Stone ! I bet he asked Dumbledore to keep it safe for him , because they 're friends and he knew someone was after it , that 's why he wanted the Stone moved out of Gringotts ! ;Hermione;Dumbledore,Stone;0.625;3896;98
 A stone that makes gold and stops you from ever dying !  said Harry .;Harry;Ron;0.0;3897;98
 No wonder Snape 's after it ! Anyone would want it . ;Harry;Ron;0.0;3898;98
 And no wonder we could n't find Flamel in that Study of Recent Developments in Wizardry ,  said Ron .;Ron;Flamel;0.0;3899;98
 He 's not exactly recent if he 's six hundred and sixty-five , is he ? ;Ron;Ron;0.0;3900;98
 I 'm going to play ,  he told Ron and Hermione .;Harry;Hermione;0.0;3904;99
 If I do n't , all the Slytherins will think I 'm just too scared to face Snape . I 'll show them...it 'll really wipe the smiles off their faces if we win . ;Harry;Slytherin,Snape;0.5;3905;99
 Just as long as we 're not wiping you off the field ,  said Hermione .;Hermione;Ron;-0.05;3906;99
 Now , do n't forget , it 's Locomotor Mortis ,  Hermione muttered as Ron slipped his wand up his sleeve .;Hermione;Mortis;0.0;3923;100
 I know ,  Ron snapped .;Ron;Hermione,Weasley,Malfoy,Snape,Crabbe,Harry;0.0;3924;100
 Do n't nag . ;Ron;Ron,Weasley,Malfoy,Snape,Crabbe,Harry;0.0;3925;100
 Do n't want to pressure you , Potter , but if we ever need an early capture of the Snitch it 's now . Finish the game before Snape can favor Hufflepuff too much . ;Wood;Snape,Hufflepuff;-0.0333333333333;3927;100
 The whole school 's out there !  said Fred Weasley , peering out of the door .;Fred;Hermione,Ron,Malfoy,Snape,Crabbe,Harry;0.25;3928;100
 Even - blimey - Dumbledore 's come to watch ! ;Fred;Ron,Weasley,Malfoy,Snape,Crabbe,Harry;0.0;3929;100
 Dumbledore ?  he said , dashing to the door to make sure .;Harry;Hermione,Ron,Weasley,Snape,Crabbe,Harry;0.5;3931;100
 I 've never seen Snape look so mean ,  he told Hermione .;Harry;Snape;-0.3125;3937;100
 Look - they 're off . Ouch ! ;Harry;Hermione,Ron,Weasley,Malfoy,Snape,Crabbe;0.0;3938;100
 Oh , sorry , Weasley , did n't see you there . ;Malfoy;Hermione,Ron,Weasley,Snape,Crabbe,Harry;-0.5;3941;100
 Wonder how long Potter 's going to stay on his broom this time ? Anyone want a bet ? What about you , Weasley ? ;Malfoy;Ron,Weasley,Malfoy,Snape,Crabbe,Harry;-0.05;3943;100
 You know how I think they choose people for the Gryffindor team ?  said Malfoy loudly a few minutes later , as Snape awarded Hufflepuff another penalty for no reason at all .;Malfoy;Hermione,Ron,Weasley,Malfoy,Crabbe,Harry;-0.1;3946;100
 It 's people they feel sorry for . See , there 's Potter , who 's got no parents , then there 's the Weasleys , who 've got no money - you should be on the team , Longbottom , you 've got no brains . ;Malfoy;Potter,Weasley;-0.5;3947;100
 I 'm worth twelve of you , Malfoy ,  he stammered .;Neville;Hermione,Ron,Weasley,Snape,Crabbe,Harry;0.3;3949;100
"Malfoy , Crabbe , and Goyle howled with laughter , but Ron , still not daring to take his eyes from the game , said , "" You tell him , Neville . """;Ron;Hermione,Ron,Weasley,Malfoy,Snape,Harry;-0.4;3950;100
 Longbottom , if brains were gold you 'd be poorer than Weasley , and that 's saying something . ;Malfoy;Ron,Weasley,Malfoy,Snape,Crabbe,Harry;0.0;3951;100
 I 'm warning you , Malfoy - one more word - ;Ron;Hermione,Ron,Weasley,Snape,Crabbe,Harry;0.5;3953;100
" Ron !  said Hermione suddenly , "" Harry - """;Hermione;Ron,Weasley,Malfoy,Snape,Crabbe,Harry;0.0;3954;100
 What ? Where ? ;Ron;Hermione,Ron,Weasley,Malfoy,Snape,Crabbe;0.0;3955;100
 You 're in luck , Weasley , Potter 's obviously spotted some money on the ground !  said Malfoy .;Malfoy;Hermione,Ron,Weasley,Snape,Crabbe,Harry;0.0;3958;100
 Come on , Harry !  Hermione screamed , leaping onto her seat to watch as Harry sped straight at Snape - she did n't even notice Malfoy and Ron rolling around under her seat , or the scuffles and yelps coming from the whirl of fists that was Neville , Crabbe , and Goyle .;Hermione;Ron,Weasley,Malfoy,Snape,Crabbe,Harry;0.2;3962;100
 Ron ! Ron ! Where are you ? The game 's over ! Harry 's won ! We 've won ! Gryffindor is in the lead !  shrieked Hermione , dancing up and down on her seat and hugging Parvati Patil in the row in front .;Hermione;Gryffindor;-0.566059027778;3965;100
 Well done ,  said Dumbledore quietly , so that only Harry could hear .;Dumbledore;Hermione,Ron,Weasley,Malfoy,Snape,Crabbe;0.0;3970;100
 Nice to see you have n't been brooding about that mirror...been keeping busy...excellent ... ;Snape;Ron,Weasley,Malfoy,Snape,Crabbe,Harry;0.6;3971;100
 ...d-do n't know why you wanted t-t-to meet here of all p-places , Severus ... ;Quirrell;Quirrell;0.0;4000;101
 Oh , I thought we 'd keep this private ,  said Snape , his voice icy .;Snape;Quirrell;-0.05;4001;101
 Students are n't supposed to know about the Sorcerer 's Stone , after all . ;Snape;Quirrell;0.0;4002;101
 Have you found out how to get past that beast of Hagrid 's yet ? ;Snape;Snape;-0.25;4006;101
 B-b-but Severus , I - ;Quirrell;Quirrell;0.0;4007;101
 You do n't want me as your enemy , Quirrell ,  said Snape , taking a step toward him .;Snape;Quirrell;0.0;4008;101
 I-I do n't know what you - ;Quirrell;Quirrell;0.0;4009;101
 You know perfectly well what I mean . ;Snape;Quirrell;0.34375;4010;101
"He steadied himself in time to hear Snape say , "" - your little bit of hocus-pocus . I 'm waiting . """;Snape;Quirrell;-0.1875;4012;101
 B-but I d-d-do n't - ;Quirrell;Quirrell;0.0;4013;101
 Very well ,  Snape cut in .;Snape;Quirrell;0.2;4014;101
 We 'll have another little chat soon , when you 've had time to think things over and decided where your loyalties lie . ;Snape;Snape;-0.1875;4015;101
 Harry , where have you been ?  Hermione squeaked .;Hermione;Ron,Harry;0.0;4019;102
 We won ! You won ! We won !  shouted Ron , thumping Harry on the back .;Ron;Hermione,Harry;0.0;4020;102
 And I gave Malfoy a black eye , and Neville tried to take on Crabbe and Goyle single-handed ! He 's still out cold but Madam Pomfrey says he 'll be all right - talk about showing Slytherin ! I 've waiting for you in the common room , we 're having a party , Fred and George stole some cakes and stuff from the kitchens . ;Ron;Neville,Pomfrey,Fred,Slytherin;-0.187797619048;4021;102
 Never mind that now ,  said Harry breathlessly .;Harry;Hermione,Ron;0.0;4022;102
 Let 's find an empty room , you wait ' til you hear this ... ;Harry;Ron,Harry;-0.1;4023;102
 So we were right , it is the Sorcerer 's Stone , and Snape 's trying to force Quirrell to help him get it . He asked if he knew how to get past Fluffy - and he said something about Quirrell 's ' hocus pocus ' - I reckon there are other things guarding the stone apart from Fluffy , loads of enchantments , probably , and Quirrell would have done some anti-Dark Arts spell that Snape needs to break through - ;Harry;Quirrell,Snape,Fluffy;-0.0978571428571;4025;102
 So you mean the Stone 's only safe as long as Quirrell stands up to Snape ?  said Hermione in alarm .;Hermione;Stone;0.034375;4026;102
 It 'll be gone by next Tuesday ,  said Ron .;Ron;Hermione,Harry;0.0;4027;102
 Hermione , the exams are ages away . ;Ron;Hermione,Hagrid,Harry;0.0;4041;103
 Ten weeks ,  Hermione snapped .;Hermione;Ron,Hagrid,Harry;0.0;4042;103
 That 's not ages , that 's like a second to Nicolas Flamel . ;Hermione;Hermione,Ron,Hagrid;0.0;4043;103
 But we 're not six hundred years old ,  Ron reminded her .;Ron;Hermione,Hagrid,Harry;0.1;4044;103
 Anyway , what are you studying for , you already know it 's an A. ;Ron;Hermione,Ron,Hagrid;0.0;4045;103
 What am I studying for ? Are you crazy ? You realize we need to pass these exams to get into the second year ? They 're very important , I should have started studying a month ago , I do n't know what 's gotten into me ... ;Hermione;Ron,Hagrid,Harry;-0.0266666666667;4046;103
 I 'll never remember this ,  Ron burst out one afternoon , throwing down his quill and looking longingly out of the library window .;Ron;Hermione,Hagrid,Harry;-0.155555555556;4051;103
"Harry , who was looking up "" Dittany "" in One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi , did n't look up until he heard Ron say , "" Hagrid ! What are you doing in the library ? """;Ron;Hermione,Hagrid,Harry;0.625;4054;103
 Jus ' lookin ' ,  he said , in a shifty voice that got their interest at once .;Hagrid;Hermione,Ron,Hagrid;0.0;4057;103
 An ' what 're you lot up ter ?  He looked suddenly suspicious .;Hagrid;Hermione,Hagrid,Harry;0.0;4058;103
 Yer not still lookin ' fer Nicolas Flamel , are yeh ? ;Hagrid;Hermione,Ron,Hagrid;0.0;4059;103
 Oh , we found out who he is ages ago ,  said Ron impressively .;Ron;Hermione,Hagrid,Harry;1.0;4060;103
 And we know what that dog 's guarding , it 's a Sorcerer 's St - ;Harry;Sorcerer;0.0;4061;103
 Shhhh !  Hagrid looked around quickly to see if anyone was listening .;Hagrid;Hermione,Ron,Harry;0.333333333333;4062;103
 Don ' go shoutin ' about it , what 's the matter with yeh ? ;Hagrid;Don;0.0;4063;103
" There are a few things we wanted to ask you , as a matter of fact ,  said Harry , "" about what 's guarding the Stone apart from Fluffy - """;Harry;Stone;-0.2;4064;103
 SHHHH !  said Hagrid again .;Hagrid;Hermione,Ron,Harry;0.0;4065;103
 Listen - come an ' see me later , I 'm not promisin ' I 'll tell yeh anythin ' , mind , but don ' go rabbitin ' about it in here , students aren ' s'pposed ter know . They 'll think I 've told yeh - ;Hagrid;Hermione,Hagrid,Harry;0.0;4066;103
 See you later , then ,  said Harry .;Harry;Hermione,Ron,Hagrid;0.0;4067;103
 What was he hiding behind his back ?  said Hermione thoughtfully .;Hermione;Ron,Hagrid,Harry;0.0;4069;103
 Do you think it had anything to do with the Stone ? ;Hermione;Hermione,Ron,Hagrid;0.0;4070;103
 I 'm going to see what section he was in ,  said Ron , who 'd had enough of working .;Ron;Hermione,Hagrid,Harry;0.0;4071;103
 Dragons !  he whispered .;Ron;Hermione,Ron,Hagrid;0.0;4073;103
 Hagrid was looking up stuff about dragons ! Look at these : Dragon Species of Great Britain and Ireland  ,  From Egg to Inferno , A Dragon Keeper 's Guide . ;Ron;Hagrid;0.8;4074;103
 Hagrid 's always wanted a dragon , he told me so the first time I ever met him ,  said Harry .;Harry;Hermione,Ron,Hagrid;0.25;4075;103
 But it 's against our laws ,  said Ron .;Ron;Hermione,Hagrid,Harry;0.0;4076;103
 Dragon breeding was outlawed by the Warlocks ' Convention of 1709 , everyone knows that . It 's hard to stop Muggles from noticing us if we 're keeping dragons in the back garden - anyway , you ca n't tame dragons , it 's dangerous . You should see the burns Charlie 's got off wild ones in Romania . ;Ron;Dragon,Charlie;-0.136666666667;4077;103
 But there are n't wild dragons in Britain ?  said Harry .;Harry;Hermione,Ron,Hagrid;-0.05;4078;103
 Of course there are ,  said Ron .;Ron;Hermione,Hagrid,Harry;0.0;4079;103
 Common Welsh Green and Hebridean Blacks . The Ministry of Magic has a job hushing them up , I can tell you . Our kind have to keep putting spells on Muggles who 've spotted them , to make them forget . ;Ron;Magic;0.15;4080;103
 So what on earth 's Hagrid up to ?  said Hermione .;Hermione;Ron,Hagrid,Harry;0.0;4081;103
"Hagrid called "" Who is it ? "" before he let them in , and then shut the door quickly behind them .";Hagrid;Harry,Hermione,Ron;-0.4;4084;104
 So - yeh wanted to ask me somethin ' ? ;Hagrid;Harry,Hagrid,Ron;0.0;4088;104
 Yes ,  said Harry .;Harry;Hagrid,Hermione,Ron;0.0;4089;104
 We were wondering if you could tell us what 's guarding the Sorcerer 's Stone apart from Fluffy . ;Harry;Sorcerer;-0.2;4091;104
 O ' course I ca n't ,  he said .;Hagrid;Harry,Hermione,Ron;0.0;4093;104
 Number one , I don ' know meself . Number two , yeh know too much already , so I wouldn ' tell yeh if I could . That Stone 's here fer a good reason . It was almost stolen outta Gringotts - I s'ppose yeh 've worked that out an ' all ? Beats me how yeh even know abou ' Fluffy . ;Hagrid;Hagrid,Hermione,Ron;0.233333333333;4094;104
 Oh , come on , Hagrid , you might not want to tell us , but you do know , you know everything that goes on round here ,  said Hermione in a warm , flattering voice .;Hermione;Harry,Hagrid,Ron;0.2;4095;104
 We only wondered who had done the guarding , really .  Hermione went on .;Hermione;Harry,Hagrid,Ron;0.1;4097;104
 We wondered who Dumbledore had trusted enough to help him , apart from you . ;Hermione;Harry,Hermione,Ron;0.0;4098;104
" Well , I don ' s'pose it could hurt ter tell yeh that...let 's see...he borrowed Fluffy from me...then some o ' the teachers did enchantments...Professor Sprout - Professor Flitwick - Professor McGonagall -  he ticked them off on his fingers , "" Professor Quirrell - an ' Dumbledore himself did somethin ' , o ' course . Hang on , I 've forgotten someone . Oh yeah , Professor Snape . """;Hagrid;Fluffy;-0.2;4101;104
 Snape ? ;Harry;Harry,Hermione,Ron;0.0;4102;104
 Yeah - yer not still on abou ' that , are yeh ? Look , Snape helped protect the Stone , he 's not about ter steal it . ;Hagrid;Snape,Stone;0.0;4103;104
 You 're the only one who knows how to get past Fluffy . are n't you , Hagrid ?  said Harry anxiously .;Harry;Fluffy;-0.175;4107;104
 And you would n't tell anyone , would you ? Not even one of the teachers ? ;Harry;Harry,Hagrid,Ron;0.0;4108;104
 Not a soul knows except me an ' Dumbledore ,  said Hagrid proudly .;Hagrid;Harry,Hermione,Ron;0.8;4109;104
 Well , that 's something ,  Harry muttered to the others .;Harry;Hagrid,Hermione,Ron;0.0;4110;104
 Hagrid , can we have a window open ? I 'm boiling . ;Hermione;Harry,Hagrid,Ron;0.0;4111;104
 Ca n't , Harry , sorry ,  said Hagrid .;Hagrid;Harry,Hermione,Ron;-0.5;4112;104
 Hagrid - what 's that ? ;Harry;Hagrid,Hermione,Ron;0.0;4115;104
" Ah ,  said Hagrid , fiddling nervously with his beard , "" That 's - er ... """;Hagrid;Harry,Hermione,Ron;0.0;4118;104
 Where did you get it , Hagrid ?  said Ron , crouching over the fire to get a closer look at the egg .;Ron;Harry,Hagrid,Hermione;0.0;4119;104
 It must 've cost you a fortune . ;Ron;Hagrid,Hermione,Ron;0.0;4120;104
 Won it ,  said Hagrid .;Hagrid;Harry,Hermione,Ron;0.0;4121;104
 Las ' night . I was down in the village havin ' a few drinks an ' got into a game o ' cards with a stranger . Think he was quite glad ter get rid of it , ter be honest . ;Hagrid;Hagrid,Hermione,Ron;0.0688888888889;4122;104
 But what are you going to do with it when it 's hatched ?  said Hermione .;Hermione;Harry,Hagrid,Ron;0.0;4123;104
 Well , I 've bin doin ' some readin ' ,  said Hagrid , pulling a large book from under his pillow .;Hagrid;Harry,Hermione,Ron;0.214285714286;4124;104
 Got this outta the library - Dragon Breeding for Pleasure and Profit - it 's a bit outta date , o ' course , but it 's all in here . Keep the egg in the fire , ' cause their mothers breathe on I em , see , an ' when it hatches , feed it on a bucket o ' brandy mixed with chicken blood every half hour . An ' see here - how ter recognize diff ' rent eggs - what I got there 's a Norwegian Ridgeback . They 're rare , them . ;Hagrid;Ridgeback;-0.0933333333333;4125;104
 Hagrid , you live in a wooden house ,  she said .;Hermione;Harry,Hermione,Ron;0.0681818181818;4127;104
 Wonder what it 's like to have a peaceful life ,  Ron sighed , as evening after evening they struggled through all the extra homework they were getting .;Ron;Harry;0.125;4132;105
 Hermione , how many times in our lives are we going to see a dragon hatching ? ;Ron;Harry;0.5;4139;105
 We 've got lessons , we 'll get into trouble , and that 's nothing to what Hagrid 's going to be in when someone finds out what he 's doing - ;Hermione;Harry;-0.2;4140;105
 Shut up !  Harry whispered .;Harry;Ron;0.0;4141;105
 It 's nearly out .  He ushered them inside .;Hagrid;Harry;0.1;4148;105
 Is n't he beautiful ?  Hagrid murmured .;Hagrid;Hermione,Harry;0.85;4159;106
 Bless him , look , he knows his mommy !  said Hagrid .;Hagrid;Hermione,Harry;0.0;4162;106
" Hagrid ,  said Hermione , "" how fast do Norwegian Ridgebacks grow , exactly ? """;Hermione;Ridgeback;0.15;4163;106
 What 's the matter ? ;Hermione;Hermione,Harry;0.0;4165;106
 Someone was lookin ' through the gap in the curtains - it 's a kid - he 's runnin ' back up ter the school . ;Hagrid;Hagrid,Hermione;0.0;4166;106
 Just let him go ,  Harry urged .;Harry;Hagrid,Ron;0.0;4173;107
 Set him free . ;Harry;Harry,Hagrid;0.4;4174;107
 I ca n't ,  said Hagrid .;Hagrid;Harry,Ron;0.0;4175;107
 He 's too little . He 'd die . ;Hagrid;Harry,Hagrid;-0.1875;4176;107
 I 've decided to call him Norbert ,  said Hagrid , looking at the dragon with misty eyes .;Hagrid;Norbert;0.0;4182;107
 He really knows me now , watch . Norbert ! Norbert ! Where 's Mommy ? ;Hagrid;Hagrid,Ron;0.3125;4183;107
 He 's lost his marbles ,  Ron muttered in Harry 's ear .;Ron;Harry,Hagrid;0.0;4184;107
" Hagrid ,  said Harry loudly , "" give it two weeks and Norbert 's going to be as long as your house . Malfoy could go to Dumbledore at any moment . """;Harry;Malfoy;0.25;4185;107
 I - I know I ca n't keep him forever , but I ca n't jus ' dump him , I ca n't . ;Hagrid;Harry,Hagrid;0.0;4187;107
 Charlie .  he said .;Harry;Harry,Ron;0.0;4189;107
 You 're losing it , too ,  said Ron .;Ron;Harry,Hagrid;0.0;4190;107
 I 'm Ron , remember ? ;Ron;Ron;0.0;4191;107
 No - Charlie - your brother , Charlie . In Romania . Studying dragons . We could send Norbert to him . Charlie can take care of him and then put him back in the wild ! ;Harry;Charlie,Norbert;0.0625;4192;107
 Brilliant !  said Ron .;Ron;Harry,Hagrid;1.0;4193;107
 How about it , Hagrid ? ;Ron;Harry,Ron;0.0;4194;107
 It bit me !  he said , showing them his hand , which was wrapped in a bloody handkerchief .;Ron;Harry;-0.8;4202;108
 I 'm not going to be able to hold a quill for a week . I tell you , that dragon 's the most horrible animal I 've ever met , but the way Hagrid goes on about it , you 'd think it was a fluffy little bunny rabbit . When it bit me he told me off for frightening it . And when I left , he was singing it a lullaby . ;Ron;Hagrid;-0.126785714286;4203;108
 It 's Hedwig !  said Harry , hurrying to let her in .;Harry;Hedwig;0.0;4205;108
 She 'll have Charlie 's answer ! ;Harry;Charlie;0.0;4206;108
 We 've got the invisibility cloak ,  said Harry .;Harry;;0.0;4223;109
 It should n't be too difficult â€“ I think the cloaks big enough to cover two of us and Norbert . ;Harry;;-0.166666666667;4224;109
" It 's not just my hand ,  he whispered , "" although that feels like it 's about to fall off . Malfoy told Madam Pomfrey he wanted to borrow one of my books so he could come and have a good laugh at me . He kept threatening to tell her what really bit me - I 've told her it was a dog , but I do n't think she believes me - I should n't have hit him at the Quidditch match , that 's why he 's doing this . """;Ron;Malfoy,Pomfrey;0.4;4235;110
 It 'll all be over at midnight on Saturday ,  said Hermione , but this did n't soothe Ron at all .;Hermione;Harry;0.0;4237;110
 Midnight on Saturday !  he said in a hoarse voice .;Harry;Harry;0.0;4239;110
 Oh no oh no - I 've just remembered - Charlie 's letter was in that book Malfoy took , he 's going to know we 're getting rid of Norbert . ;Harry;Hagrid;0.0;4240;110
 It 's too late to change the plan now ,  Harry told Hermione .;Harry;Fang,Charlie;-0.3;4244;111
 We have n't got time to send Charlie another owl , and this could be our only chance to get rid of Norbert . We 'll have to risk it . And we have got the invisibility cloak , Malfoy does n't know about that . ;Harry;Malfoy,Charlie;0.0;4245;111
 I wo n't let you in ,  he puffed .;Hagrid;Harry,Charlie;0.0;4247;111
 Norbert 's at a tricky stage - nothin ' I ca n't handle . ;Hagrid;Fang,Charlie;0.0;4248;111
 Aargh ! It 's all right , he only got my boot - jus ' playin ' - he 's only a baby , after all . ;Hagrid;Harry,Fang;0.0952380952381;4250;111
 He 's got lots o ' rats an ' some brandy fer the journey ,  said Hagrid in a muffled voice .;Hagrid;Harry,Hermione;0.0;4257;112
 An ' I 've packed his teddy bear in case he gets lonely . ;Hagrid;Hagrid,Hermione;-0.1;4258;112
 Bye-bye , Norbert !  Hagrid sobbed , as Harry and Hermione covered the crate with the invisibility cloak and stepped underneath it themselves .;Hagrid;Harry,Hermione;0.0;4260;112
 Mommy will never forget you ! ;Hagrid;Mommy;0.0;4261;112
 Nearly there !  Harry panted as they reached the corridor beneath the tallest tower .;Harry;Hagrid,Hermione;0.125;4265;112
 Detention !  she shouted .;Professor;Harry,Hermione;0.0;4270;112
 And twenty points from Slytherin ! Wandering around in the middle of the night , how dare you - ;Professor;Hagrid,Hermione;0.0;4271;112
 You do n't understand , Professor . Harry Potter 's coming - he 's got a dragon ! ;Malfoy;Harry,Hermione;0.0;4272;112
 What utter rubbish ! How dare you tell such lies ! Come on - I shall see Professor Snape about you , Malfoy ! ;Professor;Snape;0.0;4273;112
 Malfoy 's got detention ! I could sing ! ;Hermione;Harry,Hermione;0.0;4277;112
 Do n't ,  Harry advised her .;Harry;Hagrid,Hermione;0.0;4278;112
" Well , well , well ,  he whispered , "" we are in trouble . """;Filch;;-0.2;4289;113
 Harry !  Neville burst out , the moment he saw the other two .;Neville;McGonagall,Harry,Gryffindor;-0.125;4308;114
 I was trying to find you to warn you , I heard Malfoy saying he was going to catch you , he said you had a drag - ;Neville;Malfoy;-0.1;4309;114
 I would never have believed it of any of you . Mr. Filch says you were up in the astronomy tower . It 's one o'clock in the morning . Explain yourselves . ;McGonagall;Filch;0.0;4312;114
 I think I 've got a good idea of what 's been going on ,  said Professor McGonagall .;McGonagall;Neville,Harry,Gryffindor;0.7;4315;114
 It does n't take a genius to work it out . You fed Draco Malfoy some cock-and-bull story about a dragon , trying to get him out of bed and into trouble . I 've already caught him . I suppose you think it 's funny that Longbottom here heard the story and believed it , too ? ;Neville;Longbottom,Malfoy;0.25;4316;114
 I 'm disgusted ,  said Professor McGonagall .;McGonagall;Neville,Harry,Gryffindor;-1.0;4319;114
 Four students out of bed in one night ! I 've never heard of such a thing before ! You , Miss Granger , I thought you had more sense . As for you , Mr. Potter , I thought Gryffindor meant more to you than this . All three of you will receive detentions - yes , you too , Mr. Longbottom , nothing gives you the right to walk around school at night , especially these days , it 's very dangerous - and fifty points will be taken from Gryffindor . ;McGonagall;Gryffindor;0.0842857142857;4320;114
 Fifty ?  Harry gasped - they would lose the lead , the lead he 'd won in the last Quidditch match .;Harry;Neville,McGonagall,Gryffindor;0.0;4321;114
 Fifty points each ,  said Professor McGonagall , breathing heavily through her long , pointed nose .;McGonagall;Neville,Harry,Gryffindor;-0.125;4322;114
 Professor - please - ;Neville;McGonagall,Harry,Gryffindor;0.0;4323;114
 You ca n't - ;Harry;Neville,Harry,Gryffindor;0.0;4324;114
 Do n't tell me what I can and ca n't do , Potter . Now get back to bed , all of you . I 've never been more ashamed of Gryffindor students . ;McGonagall;Neville,McGonagall,Harry;0.25;4325;114
"Slytherins , on the other hand , clapped as he walked past them , whistling and cheering , "" Thanks Potter , we owe you one ! """;;Harry,Wood;-0.0416666666667;4343;115
 They 'll all forget this in a few weeks . Fred and George have lost loads of points in all the time they 've been here , and people still like them . ;Ron;Fred;-0.2;4345;115
 They 've never lost a hundred and fifty points in one go , though , have they ?  said Harry miserably .;Harry;Ron,Wood;-1.0;4346;115
 Well - no ,  Ron admitted .;Ron;Harry,Wood;0.0;4347;115
 Resign ?  Wood thundered .;Wood;Ron,Harry;0.0;4351;115
 What good 'll that do ? How are we going to get any points back if we ca n't win at Quidditch ? ;Wood;Harry,Wood;0.1;4352;115
"The rest of the team would n't speak to Harry during practice , and if they had to speak about him , they called him "" the Seeker . """;Harry;Ron,Wood;0.0;4354;115
 No - no - not again , please - ;Quirrell;;0.0;4364;116
 All right - all right -  he heard Quirrell sob .;Quirrell;;0.285714285714;4367;116
 Snape 's done it , then !  said Ron .;Ron;Hermione,Harry;0.0;4377;117
 If Quirrell 's told him how to break his Anti-Dark Force spell - ;Harry;Force;0.0;4378;117
 There 's still Fluffy , though ,  said Hermione .;Hermione;Ron,Harry;-0.2;4379;117
 Maybe Snape 's found out how to get past him without asking Hagrid ,  said Ron , looking up at the thousands of books surrounding them .;Ron;Hagrid;-0.25;4380;117
 I bet there 's a book somewhere in here telling you how to get past a giant three-headed dog . So what do we do , Harry ? ;Ron;Ron,Hermione;-0.125;4381;117
 Go to Dumbledore . That 's what we should have done ages ago . If we try anything ourselves we 'll be thrown out for sure . ;Hermione;Hermione,Harry;0.5;4383;117
 But we 've got no proof !  said Harry .;Harry;Ron,Hermione;0.0;4384;117
 Quirrell 's too scared to back us up . Snape 's only got to say he does n't know how the troll got in at Halloween and that he was nowhere near the third floor - who do you think they 'll believe , him or us ? It 's not exactly a secret we hate him , Dumbledore 'll think we made it up to get him sacked . Filch would n't help us if his life depended on it , he 's too friendly with Snape , and the more students get thrown out , the better , he 'll think . And do n't forget , we 're not supposed to know about the Stone or Fluffy . That 'll take a lot of explaining . ;Harry;Dumbledore,Filch;0.0675;4385;117
 If we just do a bit of poking around - ;Hermione;Ron,Harry;0.0;4387;117
" No ,  said Harry flatly , "" we 've done enough poking around . """;Harry;Ron,Hermione;-0.0125;4388;117
 Follow me ,  said Filch , lighting a lamp and leading them outside .;Filch;Neville,Hagrid,Harry,Malfoy,Ron,Hermione;0.0;4404;118
 I bet you 'll think twice about breaking a school rule again , wo n't you , eh ?  he said , leering at them .;Filch;Filch,Neville,Harry,Malfoy,Ron,Hermione;0.0;4405;118
 Oh yes...hard work and pain are the best teachers if you ask me....It 's just a pity they let the old punishments die out...hang you by your wrists from the ceiling for a few days , I 've got the chains still in my office , keep ' em well oiled in case they 're ever needed...Right , off we go , and do n't think of running off , now , it 'll be worse for you if you do . ;Filch;Filch,Hagrid,Harry,Malfoy,Ron,Hermione;0.08;4406;118
 Is that you , Filch ? Hurry up , I want ter get started . ;Hagrid;Filch,Neville,Harry,Malfoy,Ron,Hermione;0.0;4414;118
"His relief must have showed in his face , because Filch said , "" I suppose you think you 'll be enjoying yourself with that oaf ? Well , think again , boy - it 's into the forest you 're going and I 'm much mistaken if you 'll all come out in one piece . """;Filch;Neville,Hagrid,Harry,Malfoy,Ron,Hermione;0.35;4416;118
 The forest ?  he repeated , and he did n't sound quite as cool as usual .;Malfoy;Filch,Neville,Harry,Malfoy,Ron,Hermione;-0.0333333333333;4418;118
 We ca n't go in there at night - there 's all sorts of things in there - werewolves , I heard . ;Malfoy;Filch,Neville,Hagrid,Harry,Malfoy,Hermione;0.0;4419;118
 That 's your problem , is n't it ?  said Filch , his voice cracking with glee .;Filch;Neville,Hagrid,Harry,Malfoy,Ron,Hermione;0.0;4421;118
 Should 've thought of them werewolves before you got in trouble , should n't you ? ;Filch;Filch,Neville,Hagrid,Harry,Malfoy,Hermione;-0.2;4422;118
 Abou ' time ,  he said .;Hagrid;Filch,Neville,Harry,Malfoy,Ron,Hermione;0.0;4425;118
 I bin waitin ' fer half an hour already . All right , Harry , Hermione ? ;Hagrid;Filch,Neville,Hagrid,Harry,Malfoy,Hermione;0.0595238095238;4426;118
 I should n't be too friendly to them , Hagrid ,  said Filch coldly , they 're here to be punished , after all .;Filch;Neville,Hagrid,Harry,Malfoy,Ron,Hermione;-0.1125;4427;118
"That 's why yer late , is it ? "" said Hagrid , frowning at Filch .";Hagrid;Filch,Neville,Harry,Malfoy,Ron,Hermione;-0.3;4429;118
 Bin lecturin ' them , eh ? ' Snot your place ter do that . Yeh 've done yer bit , I 'll take over from here . ;Hagrid;Yeh;0.0;4430;118
" I 'll be back at dawn ,  said Filch , "" for what 's left of them , "" he added nastily , and he turned and started back toward the castle , his lamp bobbing away in the darkness .";Filch;Neville,Hagrid,Harry,Malfoy,Ron,Hermione;-0.25;4431;118
 I 'm not going in that forest ,  he said , and Harry was pleased to hear the note of panic in his voice .;Malfoy;Filch,Neville,Hagrid,Malfoy,Ron,Hermione;0.5;4433;118
 Yeh are if yeh want ter stay at Hogwarts ,  said Hagrid fiercely .;Hagrid;Yeh;0.0;4434;118
 Yeh 've done wrong an ' now yeh 've got ter pay fer it . ;Hagrid;Yeh;-0.5;4435;118
 But this is servant stuff , it 's not for students to do . I thought we 'd be copying lines or something , if my father knew I was doing this , he ' d - ;Malfoy;Neville,Hagrid,Harry,Malfoy,Ron,Hermione;0.0;4436;118
 - tell yer that 's how it is at Hogwarts ,  Hagrid growled .;Hagrid;Filch,Neville,Harry,Malfoy,Ron,Hermione;0.0;4437;118
 Copyin ' lines ! What good 's that ter anyone ? Yeh 'll do summat useful or yeh 'll get out . If yeh think yer father 'd rather you were expelled , then get back off ter the castle an ' pack . Go on . ;Hagrid;Yeh;0.333333333333;4438;118

" Look there ,  said Hagrid , "" see that stuff shinin ' on the ground ? Silvery stuff ? That 's unicorn blood . There 's a unicorn in there bin hurt badly by summat .

 And what if whatever hurt the unicorn finds us first ?  said Malfoy , unable to keep the fear out of his voice .;Malfoy;Filch,Neville,Hagrid,Harry,Ron,Hermione;-0.125;4446;118
 There 's nothin ' that lives in the forest that 'll hurt yeh if yer with me or Fang ,  said Hagrid .;Hagrid;Filch,Neville,Harry,Malfoy,Ron,Hermione;0.0;4447;118
 An ' keep ter the path . Right , now , we 're gonna split inter two parties an ' follow the trail in diff ' rent directions . There 's blood all over the place , it must 've bin staggerin ' around since last night at least . ;Hagrid;Filch,Neville,Hagrid,Harry,Malfoy,Hermione;-0.0047619047619;4448;118
 I want Fang ,  said Malfoy quickly , looking at Fang 's long teeth .;Malfoy;Fang;0.141666666667;4449;118
 All right , but I warn yeh , he 's a coward ,  said Hagrid .;Hagrid;Filch,Neville,Harry,Malfoy,Ron,Hermione;0.285714285714;4450;118
 So me , Harry , an ' Hermione 'll go one way an ' Draco , Neville , an ' Fang 'll go the other . Now , if any of us finds the unicorn , we 'll send up green sparks , right ?

 That wasn ' no werewolf an ' it wasn ' no unicorn , neither ,  said Hagrid grimly .;Hagrid;Filch,Neville,Harry,Malfoy,Ron,Hermione;-1.0;4473;118

 Ca n't be too careful , Ronan ,  said Hagrid , patting his crossbow .;Hagrid;Filch,Neville,Harry,Malfoy,Ron,Hermione;-0.1;4488;118

 A bit ,  said Hermione timidly .;Hermione;Filch,Neville,Hagrid,Harry,Malfoy,Ron;0.0;4494;118
 A bit . Well , that 's something .  Ronan sighed .;Ron;Filch,Neville,Hagrid,Harry,Malfoy,Hermione;0.0;4495;118
 Mars is bright tonight . ;Ron;Mars;0.7;4497;118
 Yeah ,  said Hagrid , glancing up , too .;Hagrid;Filch,Neville,Harry,Malfoy,Ron,Hermione;0.0;4498;118
 Listen , I 'm glad we 've run inter yeh , Ronan , ' cause there 's a unicorn bin hurt - you seen anythin ' ? ;Hagrid;Neville,Hagrid,Harry,Malfoy,Ron,Hermione;0.5;4499;118
 Always the innocent are the first victims ,  he said .;Ron;Filch,Neville,Hagrid,Harry,Malfoy,Hermione;0.375;4502;118
 So it has been for ages past , so it is now . ;Ron;Neville,Hagrid,Harry,Malfoy,Ron,Hermione;-0.25;4503;118
" Yeah ,  said Hagrid , "" but have yeh seen anythin ' Ronan ? Anythin ' unusual ? """;Hagrid;Filch,Neville,Harry,Malfoy,Ron,Hermione;0.2;4504;118
 Mars is bright tonight ,  Ronan repeated , while Hagrid watched him impatiently .;Ron;Mars;0.25;4505;118
 Unusually bright . ;Ron;Filch,Neville,Hagrid,Harry,Malfoy,Hermione;0.7;4506;118
 Yeah , but I was meanin ' anythin ' unusual a bit nearer home , said Hagrid .  So yeh have n't noticed anythin ' strange ?;Hagrid;Hagrid;0.75;4507;118
"At last , he said ,  The forest hides many secrets . """;Ron;Neville,Hagrid,Harry,Malfoy,Ron,Hermione;0.25;4510;118
 Hullo , Bane ,  said Hagrid .;Hagrid;Filch,Neville,Harry,Malfoy,Ron,Hermione;0.0;4512;118
 All right ? ;Hagrid;Filch,Neville,Hagrid,Harry,Malfoy,Hermione;0.285714285714;4513;118
 Good evening , Hagrid , I hope you are well ? ;Bane;Filch,Neville,Harry,Malfoy,Ron,Hermione;0.7;4514;118
 Well enough . Look , I 've jus ' bin askin ' Ronan , you seen anythin ' odd in here lately ? There 's a unicorn bin injured - would yeh know anythin ' about it ? ;Hagrid;Filch,Neville,Hagrid,Harry,Malfoy,Hermione;-0.155555555556;4515;118
 Mars is bright tonight ,  he said simply .;Bane;Mars;0.35;4518;118
 We 've heard ,  said Hagrid grumpily .;Hagrid;Filch,Neville,Harry,Malfoy,Ron,Hermione;0.0;4519;118
 Well , if either of you do see anythin ' , let me know , wo n't yeh ? We 'll be off , then . ;Hagrid;Filch,Neville,Hagrid,Harry,Malfoy,Hermione;0.0;4520;118
" Never ,  said Hagrid irritably , "" try an ' get a straight answer out of a centaur . Ruddy stargazers . Not interested in anythin ' closer'n the moon . """;Hagrid;Filch,Neville,Harry,Malfoy,Ron,Hermione;0.0375;4522;118
 Are there many of them in here ?  asked Hermione .;Hermione;Filch,Neville,Hagrid,Harry,Malfoy,Ron;0.5;4523;118
 Oh , a fair few....Keep themselves to themselves mostly , but they 're good enough about turnin ' up if ever I want a word . They 're deep , mind , centaurs...they know things...jus ' don ' let on much . ;Hagrid;Filch,Neville,Harry,Malfoy,Ron,Hermione;0.35;4524;118
 D'you think that was a centaur we heard earlier ?  said Harry .;Harry;Filch,Neville,Hagrid,Malfoy,Ron,Hermione;0.0;4525;118
 Did that sound like hooves to you ? Nah , if yeh ask me , that was what 's bin killin ' the unicorns â€“ never heard anythin ' like it before . ;Hagrid;Filch,Neville,Harry,Malfoy,Ron,Hermione;0.4;4526;118
 Hagrid ! Look ! Red sparks , the others are in trouble ! ;Hermione;Filch,Neville,Hagrid,Harry,Malfoy,Hermione;-0.125;4532;118
 You two wait here !  Hagrid shouted .;Hagrid;Filch,Neville,Harry,Malfoy,Ron,Hermione;0.0;4533;118
 Stay on the path , I 'll come back for yeh ! ;Hagrid;Filch,Neville,Hagrid,Harry,Malfoy,Hermione;0.0;4534;118
 You do n't think they 've been hurt , do you ?  whispered Hermione .;Hermione;Filch,Neville,Hagrid,Harry,Malfoy,Ron;0.0;4536;118
 I do n't care if Malfoy has , but if something 's got Neville...it 's our fault he 's here in the first place . ;Hermione;Malfoy,Neville;0.25;4537;118
" We 'll be lucky ter catch anythin ' now , with the racket you two were makin ' . Right , we 're changin ' groups - Neville , you stay with me an ' Hermione , Harry , you go with Fang an ' this idiot . I 'm sorry ,  Hagrid added in a whisper to Harry , "" but he 'll have a harder time frightenin ' you , an ' we 've gotta get this done . """;Hagrid;Malfoy;0.0047619047619;4548;119
 Look -  he murmured , holding out his arm to stop Malfoy .;Harry;Hagrid;0.0;4554;119
 AAAAAAAAAARGH ! ;Harry;;0.0;4564;120
 Are you all right ?  said the centaur , pulling Harry to his feet .;Firenze;Bane,Firenze,Hagrid;0.285714285714;4575;121
 Yes - thank you - what was that ? ;Firenze;Harry,Bane,Hagrid;0.0;4576;121
 You are the Potter boy ,  he said .;Firenze;Potter;0.0;4580;121
 You had better get back to Hagrid . The forest is not safe at this time - especially for you . Can you ride ? It will be quicker this way .;Firenze;Harry,Bane,Hagrid;0.0625;4581;121
" My name is Firenze , "" he added , as he lowered himself on to his front legs so that Harry could clamber onto his back .";Firenze;Firenze;0.0;4582;121
 Firenze !  Bane thundered .;Bane;Harry,Firenze,Hagrid;0.0;4585;121
 What are you doing ? You have a human on your back ! Have you no shame ? Are you a common mule ? ;Bane;Bane,Firenze,Hagrid;-0.1;4586;121
 Do you realize who this is ?  said Firenze .;Firenze;Harry,Bane,Hagrid;0.0;4587;121
 This is the Potter boy . The quicker he leaves this forest , the better . ;Firenze;Potter;0.5;4588;121
 What have you been telling him ?  growled Bane .;Bane;Harry,Firenze,Hagrid;0.0;4589;121
 Remember , Firenze , we are sworn not to set ourselves against the heavens . Have we not read what is to come in the movements of the planets ? ;Bane;Bane,Firenze,Hagrid;0.0;4590;121
 I 'm sure Firenze thought he was acting for the best ,  he said in his gloomy voice .;Ron;Firenze;0.5;4592;121
 For the best ! What is that to do with us ? Centaurs are concerned with what has been foretold ! It is not our business to run around like donkeys after stray humans in our forest ! ;Harry;Bane,Firenze,Hagrid;1.0;4594;121
 Do you not see that unicorn ?  Firenze bellowed at Bane .;Firenze;Harry,Bane,Hagrid;0.0;4596;121
 Do you not understand why it was killed ? Or have the planets not let you in on that secret ? I set myself against what is lurking in this forest , Bane , yes , with humans alongside me if I must . ;Firenze;Harry,Firenze,Hagrid;-0.4;4597;121
 Why 's Bane so angry ?  he asked .;Harry;Bane,Firenze,Hagrid;-0.5;4600;121
 What was that thing you saved me from , anyway ? ;Harry;Harry,Bane,Hagrid;0.0;4601;121
 Harry Potter , do you know what unicorn blood is used for ? ;Firenze;Harry,Firenze,Hagrid;0.0;4605;121
 No ,  said Harry , startled by the odd question .;Harry;Bane,Firenze,Hagrid;-0.166666666667;4606;121
 We 've only used the horn and tail hair in Potions . ;Harry;Harry,Firenze,Hagrid;0.0;4607;121
 That is because it is a monstrous thing , to slay a unicorn ,  said Firenze .;Firenze;Harry,Bane,Hagrid;0.0;4608;121
 Only one who has nothing to lose , and everything to gain , would commit such a crime . The blood of a unicorn will keep you alive , even if you are an inch from death , but at a terrible price . You have slain something pure and defenseless to save yourself , and you will have but a half-life , a cursed life , from the moment the blood touches your lips . ;Firenze;Harry,Firenze,Hagrid;-0.180952380952;4609;121
 But who 'd be that desperate ?  he wondered aloud .;Harry;Bane,Firenze,Hagrid;-0.6;4611;121
 If you 're going to be cursed forever , death 's better , is n't it ? ;Harry;Harry,Firenze,Hagrid;0.5;4612;121
" It is ,  Firenze agreed , "" unless all you need is to stay alive long enough to drink something else - something that will bring you back to full strength and power - something that will mean you can never die . Mr. Potter , do you know what is hidden in the school at this very moment ? """;Firenze;Harry,Bane,Hagrid;0.0151041666667;4613;121
 The Sorcerer 's Stone ! Of course - the Elixir of Life ! But I do n't understand who - ;Harry;Bane,Firenze,Hagrid;0.0;4614;121
 Can you think of nobody who has waited many years to return to power , who has clung to life , awaiting their chance ? ;Firenze;Harry,Bane,Hagrid;0.5;4615;121
"Over the rustling of the trees , he seemed to hear once more what Hagrid had told him on the night they had met : "" Some say he died . Codswallop , in my opinion . Dunno if he had enough human left in him to die . """;Hagrid;Harry,Bane,Firenze;0.125;4617;121
" Do you mean ,  Harry croaked , "" that was Vol - """;Harry;Voldemort;-0.3125;4618;121
 Harry ! Harry , are you all right ? ;Hermione;Harry,Bane,Hagrid;0.285714285714;4619;121
 I 'm fine ,  said Harry , hardly knowing what he was saying .;Harry;Bane,Firenze,Hagrid;0.0625;4621;121
 The unicorn 's dead , Hagrid , it 's in that clearing back there . ;Firenze;Harry,Firenze,Hagrid;-0.1;4622;121
 This is where I leave you ,  Firenze murmured as Hagrid hurried off to examine the unicorn .;Firenze;Harry,Bane,Hagrid;0.0;4623;121
 You are safe now . ;Firenze;Bane,Firenze,Hagrid;0.5;4624;121
 Good luck , Harry Potter ,  said Firenze .;Firenze;Harry,Bane,Hagrid;0.7;4626;121
 The planets have been read wrongly before now , even by centaurs . I hope this is one of those times . ;Firenze;Bane,Firenze,Hagrid;-0.5;4627;121
 Snape wants the stone for Voldemort...and Voldemort 's waiting in the forest...and all this time we thought Snape just wanted to get rich ... ;Harry;Snape;0.2875;4636;122
 Stop saying the name !  said Ron in a terrified whisper , as if he thought Voldemort could hear them .;Ron;Ron,Harry;0.0;4637;122
 Firenze saved me , but he should n't have done so....Bane was furious...he was talking about interfering with what the planets say is going to happen....They must show that Voldemort 's coming back....Bane thinks Firenze should have let Voldemort kill me....I suppose that 's written in the stars as well . ;Harry;Firenze,Hagrid;0.0;4639;122
 Will you stop saying the name !  Ron hissed .;Ron;Voldemort,Harry;0.0;4640;122
" So all I 've got to wait for now is Snape to steal the Stone ,  Harry went on feverishly , "" then Voldemort will be able to come and finish me off ... Well , I suppose Bane 'll be happy . """;Harry;Snape,Stone,Bane;0.4;4641;122
 Harry , everyone says Dumbledore 's the only one You-Know-Who was ever afraid of with Dumbledore around , You-Know-Who wo n't touch you . Anyway , who says the centaurs are right ? It sounds like fortune-telling to me , and Professor McGonagall says that 's a very imprecise branch of magic . ;Hermione;You-Know-Who,McGonagall;0.0771428571429;4643;122
 That was far easier than I thought it would be ,  said Hermione as they joined the crowds flocking out onto the sunny grounds .;Hermione;Ron,Harry,Hagrid,McGonagall,Stone,Snape;0.1;4670;123
 I need n't have learned about the 1637 Werewolf Code of Conduct or the uprising of Elfric the Eager . ;Hermione;Hermione,Ron,Hagrid,McGonagall,Stone,Snape;0.0;4671;123
 No more studying ,  Ron sighed happily , stretching out on the grass .;Ron;Hermione,Harry,Hagrid,McGonagall,Stone,Snape;0.275;4674;123
 You could look more cheerful , Harry , we 've got a week before we find out how badly we 've done , there 's no need to worry yet . ;Ron;Ron,Harry,Hagrid,McGonagall,Stone,Snape;0.0666666666667;4675;123
 I wish I knew what this means !  he burst out angrily .;Harry;Hermione,Ron,Hagrid,McGonagall,Stone,Snape;-0.5;4677;123
 My scar keeps hurting - it 's happened before , but never as often as this . ;Harry;Hermione,Harry,Hagrid,McGonagall,Stone,Snape;0.0;4678;123
 Go to Madam Pomfrey ,  Hermione suggested .;Hermione;Ron,Harry,Hagrid,McGonagall,Stone,Snape;0.0;4679;123
 I 'm not ill ,  said Harry .;Harry;Hermione,Ron,Hagrid,McGonagall,Stone,Snape;0.25;4680;123
 I think it 's a warning...it means danger 's coming ... ;Harry;Ron,Harry,Hagrid,McGonagall,Stone,Snape;0.0;4681;123
 Harry , relax , Hermione 's right , the Stone 's safe as long as Dumbledore 's around . Anyway , we 've never had any proof Snape found out how to get past Fluffy . He nearly had his leg ripped off once , he 's not going to try it again in a hurry . And Neville will play Quidditch for England before Hagrid lets Dumbledore down . ;Ron;Neville,Fluffy,Quidditch;0.0328798185941;4683;123

 I 've just thought of something ,  said Harry .;Harry;Hermione,Ron,Hagrid,McGonagall,Stone,Snape;0.0;4693;123
 We 've got to go and see Hagrid , now . ;Harry;Hagrid;0.0;4695;123
 Why ?  panted Hermione , hurrying to keep up .;Hermione;Ron,Harry,Hagrid,McGonagall,Stone,Snape;0.0;4696;123
" Do n't you think it 's a bit odd ,  said Harry , scrambling up the grassy slope , "" that what Hagrid wants more than anything else is a dragon , and a stranger turns up who just happens to have an egg in his pocket ?

 Hullo ,  he said , smiling .;Hagrid;Hermione,Ron,Hagrid,McGonagall,Stone,Snape;0.0;4700;123
 Finished yer exams ? Got time fer a drink ? ;Hagrid;Ron,Harry,Hagrid,McGonagall,Stone,Snape;0.0;4701;123
 Yes , please ,  said Ron , but Harry cut him off .;Ron;Hermione,Ron,Hagrid,McGonagall,Stone,Snape;0.0;4702;123
 No , we 're in a hurry . Hagrid , I 've got to ask you something . You know that night you won Norbert ? What did the stranger you were playing cards with look like ? ;Harry;Norbert;0.0;4703;123
" Dunno ,  said Hagrid casually , "" he wouldn ' take his cloak off . """;Hagrid;Hermione,Ron,Harry,McGonagall,Stone,Snape;-0.5;4704;123
 It 's not that unusual , yeh get a lot o ' funny folk in the Hog 's Head - that 's the pub down in the village . Mighta bin a dragon dealer , mightn ' he ? I never saw his face , he kept his hood up . ;Hagrid;Hermione,Ron,Hagrid,McGonagall,Stone,Snape;0.0981481481481;4706;123
 What did you talk to him about , Hagrid ? Did you mention Hogwarts at all ? ;Harry;Hogwarts;0.0;4708;123
 Mighta come up ,  said Hagrid , frowning as he tried to remember .;Hagrid;Hermione,Ron,Harry,McGonagall,Stone,Snape;0.0;4709;123
 Yeah...he asked what I did , an ' I told him I was gamekeeper here...He asked a bit about the sorta creatures I took after...so I told him...an ' I said what I 'd always really wanted was a dragon...an ' then...I can ' remember too well , ' cause he kept buyin ' me drinks...Let 's see...yeah , then he said he had the dragon egg an ' we could play cards fer it if I wanted...but he had ter be sure I could handle it , he didn ' want it ter go ter any old home....So I told him , after Fluffy , a dragon would be easy ... ;Hagrid;Ron,Harry,Hagrid,McGonagall,Stone,Snape;0.206666666667;4710;123
 And did he - did he seem interested in Fluffy ?  Harry asked , trying to keep his voice calm .;Harry;Hermione,Ron,Hagrid,McGonagall,Stone,Snape;0.116666666667;4711;123
 Well - yeah - how many three-headed dogs d'yeh meet , even around Hogwarts ? So I told him , Fluffy 's a piece o ' cake if yeh know how to calm him down , jus ' play him a bit o ' music an ' he 'll go straight off ter sleep - ;Hagrid;Ron,Harry,Hagrid,McGonagall,Stone,Snape;0.128888888889;4712;123

 We 've got to go to Dumbledore ,  said Harry .;Harry;Hermione,Ron,Hagrid,McGonagall,Stone,Snape;0.0;4717;123
 Hagrid told that stranger how to get past Fluffy , and it was either Snape or Voldemort under that cloak - it must 've been easy , once he 'd got Hagrid drunk . I just hope Dumbledore believes us .

 We want to see Professor Dumbledore ,  said Hermione , rather bravely , Harry and Ron thought .;Hermione;Dumbledore;0.8;4724;123
 See Professor Dumbledore ?  Professor McGonagall repeated , as though this was a very fishy thing to want to do .;McGonagall;Dumbledore;0.2;4725;123
 Why ? ;McGonagall;Hermione,Ron,Hagrid,McGonagall,Stone,Snape;0.0;4726;123
 It 's sort of secret ,  he said , but he wished at once he had n't , because Professor McGonagall 's nostrils flared .;Harry;Hermione,Ron,Harry,Hagrid,Stone,Snape;-0.4;4728;123
 Professor Dumbledore left ten minutes ago ,  she said coldly .;McGonagall;Professor;-0.2;4729;123
 He received an urgent owl from the Ministry of Magic and flew off for London at once . ;McGonagall;Ron,Harry,Hagrid,McGonagall,Stone,Snape;0.5;4730;123
 He 's gone ?  said Harry frantically .;Harry;Hermione,Ron,Hagrid,McGonagall,Stone,Snape;0.0;4731;123
 Now ? ;Harry;Ron,Harry,Hagrid,McGonagall,Stone,Snape;0.0;4732;123
 Professor Dumbledore is a very great wizard , Potter , he has many demands on his time â€“ ;McGonagall;Dumbledore;0.75;4733;123
 But this is important . ;Harry;Ron,Harry,Hagrid,McGonagall,Stone,Snape;0.4;4734;123
 Something you have to say is more important than the Ministry of Magic , Potter ? ;McGonagall;Hermione,Harry,Hagrid,McGonagall,Stone,Snape;0.466666666667;4735;123
" Look ,  said Harry , throwing caution to the winds , "" Professor - it 's about the Sorcerer 's Stone - """;Harry;Hermione,Ron,Hagrid,McGonagall,Stone,Snape;0.0;4736;123

 Hanging around like this , people will think you 're up to something . And Gryffindor really ca n't afford to lose any more points , can it ? ;Snape;Gryffindor;0.2;4762;123
 Be warned , Potter - any more nighttime wanderings and I will personally make sure you are expelled . Good day to you . ;Snape;Hermione,Ron,Hagrid,McGonagall,Stone,Snape;0.425;4765;123
 Right , here 's what we 've got to do ,  he whispered urgently .;Harry;Ron,Harry,Hagrid,McGonagall,Stone,Snape;0.285714285714;4768;123
 One of us has got to keep an eye on Snape - wait outside the staff room and follow him if he leaves it . Hermione , you 'd better do that . ;Harry;Hermione,Ron,Hagrid,McGonagall,Stone,Snape;0.25;4769;123
 Why me ? ;Hermione;Ron,Harry,Hagrid,McGonagall,Stone,Snape;0.0;4770;123
 It 's obvious ,  said Ron .;Ron;Hermione,Harry,Hagrid,McGonagall,Stone,Snape;0.0;4771;123
" You can pretend to be waiting for Professor Flitwick , you know .  He put on a high voice , "" ' Oh Professor Flitwick , I 'm so worried , I think I got question fourteen b wrong ... ' """;Ron;Hermione,Ron,Hagrid,McGonagall,Stone,Snape;-0.17;4772;123
 Oh , shut up ,  said Hermione , but she agreed to go and watch out for Snape .;Hermione;Ron,Harry,Hagrid,McGonagall,Stone,Snape;0.0;4773;123
 And we 'd better stay outside the third-floor corridor ,  Harry told Ron .;Harry;Hermione,Ron,Hagrid,McGonagall,Stone,Snape;0.25;4774;123
 Come on . ;Harry;Ron,Harry,Hagrid,McGonagall,Stone,Snape;0.0;4775;123
 I suppose you think you 're harder to get past than a pack of enchantments !  she stormed .;McGonagall;Hermione,Ron,Harry,Hagrid,Stone,Snape;-0.20625;4778;123
 Enough of this nonsense ! If I hear you 've come anywhere near here again , I 'll take another fifty points from Gryffindor ! Yes , Weasley , from my own house ! ;McGonagall;Ron,Harry,Hagrid,McGonagall,Stone,Snape;0.291666666667;4779;123
"Harry and Ron went back to the common room , Harry had just said , "" At least Hermione 's on Snape 's tail , "" when the portrait of the Fat Lady swung open and Hermione came in .";Harry;Hermione,Ron,Hagrid,McGonagall,Stone,Snape;-0.15;4780;123
 I 'm sorry , Harry !  she wailed .;Hermione;Ron,Harry,Hagrid,McGonagall,Stone,Snape;-0.625;4781;123
 Snape came out and asked me what I was doing , so I said I was waiting for Flitwick , and Snape went to get him , and I 've only just got away , I do n't know where Snape went . ;Hermione;Snape;0.0;4782;123
 Well , that 's it then , is n't it ?  Harry said .;Harry;Hermione,Ron,Hagrid,McGonagall,Stone,Snape;0.0;4783;123
 I 'm going out of here tonight and I 'm going to try and get to the Stone first . ;Harry;Ron,Harry,Hagrid,McGonagall,Stone,Snape;0.25;4786;123
 You 're mad !  said Ron .;Ron;Hermione,Harry,Hagrid,McGonagall,Stone,Snape;-0.78125;4787;123
 You ca n't !  said Hermione .;Hermione;Ron,Harry,Hagrid,McGonagall,Stone,Snape;0.0;4788;123
 After what McGonagall and Snape have said ? You 'll be expelled ! ;Hermione;Snape;0.0;4789;123
 SO WHAT  Harry shouted .;Harry;Hermione,Ron,Hagrid,McGonagall,Stone,Snape;0.0;4790;123
 Do n't you understand ? If Snape gets hold of the Stone , Voldemort 's coming back ! Have n't you heard what it was like when he was trying to take over ? There wo n't be any Hogwarts to get expelled from ! He 'll flatten it , or turn it into a school for the Dark Arts ! Losing points does n't matter anymore , ca n't you see ? D'you think he 'll leave you and your families alone if Gryffindor wins the house cup ? If I get caught before I can get to the Stone , well , I 'll have to go back to the Dursleys and wait for Voldemort to find me there , it 's only dying a bit later than I would have , because I 'm never going over to the Dark Side ! I 'm going through that trapdoor tonight and nothing you two say is going to stop me ! Voldemort killed my parents , remember ? ;Harry;Snape,Gryffindor,Voldemort;-0.0174107142857;4791;123
 You 're right Harry ,  said Hermione in a small voice .;Hermione;Harry;0.0178571428571;4793;123
 I 'll use the invisibility cloak ,  said Harry .;Harry;Hermione,Ron,Hagrid,McGonagall,Stone,Snape;0.0;4794;123
 It 's just lucky I got it back . ;Harry;Ron,Harry,Hagrid,McGonagall,Stone,Snape;0.166666666667;4795;123
 But will it cover all three of us ?  said Ron .;Ron;Hermione,Harry,Hagrid,McGonagall,Stone,Snape;0.0;4796;123
 All - all three of us ? ;Harry;Hermione,Ron,Hagrid,McGonagall,Stone,Snape;0.0;4797;123
 Oh , come off it , you do n't think we 'd let you go alone ? ;Ron;Hermione,Harry,Hagrid,McGonagall,Stone,Snape;0.0;4798;123
 Of course not ,  said Hermione briskly .;Hermione;Ron,Harry,Hagrid,McGonagall,Stone,Snape;0.0;4799;123
 How do you think you 'd get to the Stone without us ? I 'd better go and took through my books , there might be something useful ... ;Hermione;Hermione,Ron,Hagrid,McGonagall,Stone,Snape;0.4;4800;123
 But if we get caught , you two will be expelled , too . ;Harry;Hermione,Harry,Hagrid,McGonagall,Stone,Snape;0.0;4801;123
 Not if I can help it ,  said Hermione grimly .;Hermione;Ron,Harry,Hagrid,McGonagall,Stone,Snape;-1.0;4802;123
 Flitwick told me in secret that I got a hundred and twelve percent on his exam . They 're not throwing me out after that . ;Hermione;Flitwick;-0.4;4803;123
 Better get the cloak ,  Ron muttered , as Lee Jordan finally left , stretching and yawning .;Ron;Hufflepuff;0.25;4812;124
 We 'd better put the cloak on here , and make sure it covers all three of us â€“ if Filch spots one of our feet wandering along on its own - ;Harry;Filch;0.533333333333;4817;124
 What are you doing ?  said a voice from the corner of the room .;Neville;Harry,Hermione,Neville;0.0;4818;124
 Nothing , Neville , nothing ,  said Harry , hurriedly putting the cloak behind his back .;Harry;Ron,Hermione,Neville;-0.2;4820;124
 You 're going out again ,  he said .;Neville;Harry,Hermione,Neville;0.0;4822;124
 No , no , no ,  said Hermione .;Hermione;Ron,Harry,Neville;0.0;4823;124
 No , we 're not . Why do n't you go to bed , Neville ? ;Hermione;Harry,Hermione,Neville;0.0;4824;124
" You ca n't go out ,  said Neville , "" you 'll be caught again . Gryffindor will be in even more trouble . """;Neville;Gryffindor;0.15;4827;124
" You do n't understand ,  said Harry , "" this is important . """;Harry;Ron,Hermione,Neville;0.4;4828;124
"I wo n't let you do it , "" he said , hurrying to stand in front of the portrait hole . "" I 'll - I 'll fight you !";Neville;Harry,Hermione,Neville;0.0;4830;124
"Neville , "" Ron exploded , "" get away from that hole and do n't be an idiot - """;Ron;Harry,Hermione,Neville;0.0;4832;124
 Do n't you call me an idiot !  said Neville .;Neville;Ron,Harry,Hermione;0.0;4833;124
"Yes , but not to us , "" said Ron in exasperation .";Ron;Harry,Hermione,Neville;0.0;4837;124
 Neville , you do n't know what you 're doing . ;Harry;Ron,Hermione,Neville;0.0;4838;124
 Go on then , try and hit me !  said Neville , raising his fists .;Neville;Ron,Harry,Hermione;0.0;4840;124
 I 'm ready ! ;Neville;Harry,Hermione,Neville;0.25;4841;124
 Do something ,  he said desperately .;Harry;Ron,Hermione,Neville;-0.6;4843;124
" Neville ,  she said , "" I 'm really , really sorry about this . """;Hermione;Harry,Hermione,Neville;-0.5;4845;124
 Petrificus Totalus !  she cried , pointing it at Neville .;Hermione;Ron,Harry,Hermione;0.0;4847;124
 What 've you done to him ?  Harry whispered .;Harry;Ron,Hermione,Neville;0.0;4854;124
 It 's the full Body-Bind ,  said Hermione miserably .;Hermione;Binns;-0.325;4855;124
 Oh , Neville , I 'm so sorry . ;Hermione;Harry,Hermione,Neville;-0.5;4856;124
 We had to , Neville , no time to explain ,  said Harry .;Harry;Ron,Hermione,Neville;0.0;4857;124
 You 'll understand later , Neville ,  said Ron as they stepped over him and pulled on the invisibility cloak .;Ron;Harry,Hermione,Neville;0.0;4858;124
 Oh , let 's kick her , just this once ,  Ron whispered in Harry 's ear , but Harry shook his head .;Ron;Harry,Hermione,Neville;0.0;4862;124
 Who 's there ?  he said suddenly as they climbed toward him .;Peeves;Ron,Hermione,Neville;0.0;4866;124
 Know you 're there , even if I ca n't see you . Are you ghoulie or ghostie or wee student beastie ? ;Peeves;Harry,Hermione,Neville;0.0;4868;124
 Should call Filch , I should , if something 's a-creeping around unseen . ;Peeves;Filch;0.0;4870;124
" Peeves ,  he said , in a hoarse whisper , "" the Bloody Baron has his own reasons for being invisible . """;Harry;Baron;-0.1;4872;124
 So sorry , your bloodiness , Mr. Baron , Sir ,  he said greasily .;Peeves;Ron,Hermione,Neville;-0.5;4875;124
 My mistake , my mistake - I did n't see you - of course I did n't , you 're invisible - forgive old Peevsie his little joke , sir . ;Peeves;Peevsie;-0.04375;4876;124
 I have business here , Peeves ,  croaked Harry .;Harry;Ron,Hermione,Neville;0.0;4877;124
 Stay away from this place tonight . ;Harry;Harry,Hermione,Neville;0.0;4878;124
 I will , sir , I most certainly will ,  said Peeves , rising up in the air again .;Peeves;Ron,Hermione,Neville;0.357142857143;4879;124
 Hope your business goes well , Baron , I 'll not bother you . ;Peeves;Hope;0.0;4880;124
 Brilliant , Harry !  whispered Ron .;Ron;Harry,Hermione,Neville;1.0;4882;124
" Well , there you are ,  Harry said quietly , "" Snape 's already got past Fluffy . """;Harry;Ron,Hermione,Neville;-0.15;4884;124
 If you want to go back , I wo n't blame you ,  he said .;Harry;Harry,Hermione,Neville;0.0;4887;124
 You can take the cloak , I wo n't need it now . ;Harry;Ron,Hermione,Neville;0.0;4888;124
 Do n't be stupid ,  said Ron .;Ron;Harry,Hermione,Neville;-0.8;4889;124
 We 're coming ,  said Hermione .;Hermione;Ron,Harry,Neville;0.0;4890;124
 What 's that at its feet ?  Hermione whispered .;Hermione;Ron,Harry,Neville;0.0;4894;124
 Looks like a harp ,  said Ron .;Ron;Harry,Hermione,Neville;0.0;4895;124
 Snape must have left it there . ;Ron;Snape;0.0;4896;124
 It must wake up the moment you stop playing ,  said Harry .;Harry;Ron,Hermione,Neville;0.0;4897;124
 Well , here goes ... ;Hermione;Ron,Harry,Neville;0.0;4898;124
 Keep playing ,  Ron warned Harry as they slipped out of the cloak and crept toward the trapdoor .;Ron;Harry,Hermione,Neville;0.0;4903;124
 I think we 'll be able to pull the door open ,  said Ron , peering over the dog 's back .;Ron;Harry,Hermione,Neville;0.166666666667;4905;124
 Want to go first , Hermione ? ;Harry;Ron,Hermione,Neville;0.25;4906;124
 No , I do n't ! ;Hermione;Ron,Harry,Neville;0.0;4907;124
 All right .  Ron gritted his teeth and stepped carefully over the dog 's legs .;Ron;Harry,Hermione,Neville;0.0928571428571;4908;124
 What can you see ?  Hermione said anxiously .;Hermione;Ron,Harry,Neville;-0.25;4910;124
 Nothing - just black - there 's no way of climbing down , we 'll just have to drop . ;Harry;Ron,Hermione,Neville;-0.161111111111;4911;124
 You want to go first ? Are you sure ?  said Ron .;Ron;Harry,Hermione,Neville;0.375;4913;124
 I do n't know how deep this thing goes . Give the flute to Hermione so she can keep him asleep . ;Harry;Ron,Hermione,Neville;0.0;4914;124
"Then he looked up at Ron and said , "" If anything happens to me , do n't follow . Go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to Dumbledore , right ? """;Harry;Hedwig;0.242857142857;4920;124
 Right ,  said Ron .;Ron;Harry,Hermione,Neville;0.285714285714;4921;124
 See you in a minute , I hope ... ;Harry;Ron,Hermione,Neville;0.0;4922;124
" It 's okay !  he called up to the light the size of a postage stamp , which was the open trapdoor , "" it 's a soft landing , you can jump ! """;Harry;Harry,Hermione,Neville;0.2875;4929;124
 What 's this stuff ?  were his first words .;Ron;Ron,Hermione,Neville;0.25;4932;124
 Dunno , some sort of plant thing . I suppose it 's here to break the fall . Come on , Hermione ! ;Harry;Ron,Harry,Neville;0.0;4933;124
 We must be miles under the school ,  she said .;Hermione;Ron,Hermione,Neville;0.0;4937;124
 Lucky this plant thing 's here , really ,  said Ron .;Ron;Lucky;0.266666666667;4938;124
 Lucky !  shrieked Hermione .;Hermione;Ron,Harry,Neville;0.416666666667;4939;124
 Look at you both ! ;Hermione;Harry,Hermione,Neville;0.0;4940;124
 Stop moving !  Hermione ordered them .;Hermione;Ron,Harry,Neville;0.0;4946;124
 I know what this is - it 's Devil 's Snare ! ;Hermione;Devil;0.0;4947;124
 Oh , I 'm so glad we know what it 's called , that 's a great help ,  snarled Ron , leaning back , trying to stop the plant from curling around his neck .;Ron;Harry,Hermione,Neville;0.433333333333;4948;124
 Shut up , I 'm trying to remember how to kill it !  said Hermione .;Hermione;Ron,Harry,Neville;0.0;4949;124
 Well , hurry up , I ca n't breathe !  Harry gasped , wrestling with it as it curled around his chest .;Harry;Ron,Hermione,Neville;0.0;4950;124
 Devil 's Snare , Devil 's Snare...what did Professor Sprout say ? - it likes the dark and the damp . ;Hermione;Professor;-0.15;4951;124
 So light a fire !  Harry choked .;Harry;Ron,Hermione,Neville;0.5;4952;124
 Yes - of course - but there 's no wood !  Hermione cried , wringing her hands .;Hermione;Ron,Harry,Neville;0.0;4953;124
 HAVE YOU GONE MAD ?  Ron bellowed .;Ron;Harry,Hermione,Neville;-0.625;4954;124
 ARE YOU A WITCH OR NOT ? ;Ron;Ron,Hermione,Neville;0.0;4955;124
 Oh , right !  said Hermione , and she whipped out her wand , waved it , muttered something , and sent a jet of the same bluebell flames she had used on Snape at the plant .;Hermione;Ron,Harry,Neville;0.178571428571;4956;124
 Lucky you pay attention in Herbology , Hermione ,  said Harry as he joined her by the wall , wiping sweat off his face .;Harry;Ron,Hermione,Neville;0.333333333333;4959;124
" Yeah ,  said Ron , "" and lucky Harry does n't lose his head in a crisis - ' there 's no wood , ' honestly . """;Ron;Harry;0.466666666667;4960;124
 This way ,  said Harry , pointing down a stone passageway , which was the only way forward .;Harry;Ron,Hermione,Neville;-0.0777777777778;4961;124
 Can you hear something ?  Ron whispered .;Ron;Harry,Hermione,Neville;0.0;4966;124
 Do you think it 's a ghost ? ;Ron;Ron,Hermione,Neville;0.0;4969;124
 I do n't know...sounds like wings to me . ;Harry;Harry,Hermione,Neville;0.0;4970;124
 There 's light ahead - I can see something moving . ;Harry;Ron,Hermione,Neville;0.4;4971;124
 Do you think they 'll attack us if we cross the room ?  said Ron .;Ron;Harry,Hermione,Neville;0.0;4975;124
 Probably ,  said Harry .;Harry;Ron,Hermione,Neville;0.0;4976;124
 They do n't look very vicious , but I suppose if they all swooped down at once...well , there 's no other choice...I 'll run . ;Harry;Ron,Harry,Neville;-0.364351851852;4977;124
 Now what ?  said Ron .;Ron;Harry,Hermione,Neville;0.0;4984;124
 These birds...they ca n't be here just for decoration ,  said Hermione .;Hermione;Ron,Harry,Neville;0.0;4985;124
 They 're not birds !  Harry said suddenly .;Harry;Ron,Hermione,Neville;0.0;4987;124
 They 're keys ! Winged keys - look carefully . So that must mean ...  he looked around the chamber while the other two squinted up at the flock of keys .;Harry;Harry,Hermione,Neville;-0.179166666667;4988;124
 ...yes - look ! Broomsticks ! We 've got to catch the key to the door ! ;Harry;Ron,Hermione,Neville;0.0;4989;124
 But there are hundreds of them ! ;Ron;Harry,Hermione,Neville;0.0;4990;124
 We 're looking for a big , old-fashioned one - probably silver , like the handle . ;Hermione;Ron,Harry,Neville;0.0;4992;124
 That one !  he called to the others .;Harry;Ron,Hermione,Neville;0.0;4998;124
 That big one - there - no , there - with bright blue wings - the feathers are all crumpled on one side . ;Harry;Harry,Hermione,Neville;0.233333333333;4999;124
 We 've got to close in on it !  Harry called , not taking his eyes off the key with the damaged wing .;Harry;Ron,Hermione,Neville;0.0;5001;124
 Ron , you come at it from above - Hermione , stay below and stop it from going down and I 'll try and catch it . Right , NOW ! ;Harry;Harry,Hermione,Neville;0.0671957671958;5002;124
 Ready ?  Harry asked the other two , his hand on the door handle .;Harry;Ron,Hermione,Neville;0.0375;5008;124
 Now what do we do ?  Harry whispered .;Harry;Ron,Hermione,Neville;0.0;5016;124
 It 's obvious , is n't it ?  said Ron .;Ron;Harry,Hermione,Neville;0.0;5017;124
 We 've got to play our way across the room . ;Ron;Ron,Hermione,Neville;0.0;5018;124
 How ?  said Hermione nervously .;Hermione;Ron,Harry,Neville;0.0;5020;124
" I think ,  said Ron , "" we 're going to have to be chessmen . """;Ron;Harry,Hermione,Neville;0.0;5021;124
 Do we - er - have to join you to get across ?  The black knight nodded .;Ron;Ron,Hermione,Neville;-0.166666666667;5025;124
 This needs thinking about ...  he said .;Ron;Harry,Hermione,Neville;0.0;5027;124
 I suppose we 've got to take the place of three of the black pieces ... ;Harry;Ron,Hermione,Neville;-0.166666666667;5028;124
"Finally he said , "" Now , do n't be offended or anything , but neither of you are that good at chess - """;Ron;Harry,Hermione,Neville;0.35;5030;124
 We 're not offended ,  said Harry quickly .;Harry;Ron,Hermione,Neville;0.333333333333;5031;124
 Just tell us what to do . ;Harry;Harry,Hermione,Neville;0.0;5032;124
 Well , Harry , you take the place of that bishop , and Hermione , you next to him instead of that castle . ;Ron;Ron,Hermione,Neville;0.0;5033;124
 What about you ? ;Hermione;Ron,Harry,Neville;0.0;5034;124
 I 'm going to be a knight ,  said Ron .;Ron;Harry,Hermione,Neville;0.0;5035;124
 White always plays first in chess ,  said Ron , peering across the board .;Ron;White;0.125;5037;124
 Yes...look ... ;Ron;Ron,Hermione,Neville;0.0;5038;124
 Harry - move diagonally four squares to the right . ;Ron;Ron,Harry,Neville;0.285714285714;5044;124
 Had to let that happen ,  said Ron , looking shaken .;Ron;Harry,Hermione,Neville;0.0;5047;124
 Leaves you free to take that bishop , Hermione , go on . ;Ron;Ron,Hermione,Neville;0.4;5048;124
 We 're nearly there ,  he muttered suddenly .;Ron;Harry,Hermione,Neville;0.05;5053;124
 Let me think - let me think ... ;Ron;Ron,Hermione,Neville;0.0;5054;124
" Yes ...  said Ron softly , "" It 's the only way...I 've got to be taken . """;Ron;Harry,Hermione,Neville;0.05;5056;124
 NO !  Harry and Hermione shouted .;Harry;Ron,Hermione,Neville;0.0;5057;124
 That 's chess !  snapped Ron .;Ron;Harry,Hermione,Neville;0.0;5058;124
 You 've got to make some sacrifices ! I take one step forward and she 'll take me - that leaves you free to checkmate the king , Harry ! ;Ron;Ron,Hermione,Neville;0.5;5059;124
 But - ;Harry;Harry,Hermione,Neville;0.0;5060;124
 Do you want to stop Snape or not ? ;Ron;Snape;0.0;5061;124
 Ron - ;Harry;Harry,Hermione,Neville;0.0;5062;124
 Look , if you do n't hurry up , he 'll already have the Stone ! ;Ron;Stone;0.0;5063;124
 Ready ?  Ron called , his face pale but determined .;Ron;Harry,Hermione,Neville;-0.5;5065;124
 Here I go - now , do n't hang around once you 've won . ;Ron;Ron,Hermione,Neville;0.0;5066;124
 What if he 's - ? ;Hermione;Hermione;0.0;5075;125
 He 'll be all right ,  said Harry , trying to convince himself .;Harry;Hermione;0.285714285714;5076;125
 What do you reckon 's next ? ;Harry;Hermione;0.0;5077;125
 We 've had Sprout ' s , that was the Devil 's Snare  ,  Flitwick must 've put charms on the keys  ,  McGonagall transfigured the chessmen to make them alive  ,  that leaves Quirrell 's spell , and Snape ' s. ;Hermione;Flitwick,Sprout,Quirrell;0.1;5078;125
 All right ?  Harry whispered .;Harry;Hermione;0.285714285714;5080;125
 Go on . ;Harry;Hermione;0.0;5081;125
 I 'm glad we did n't have to fight that one ,  Harry whispered as they stepped carefully over one of its massive legs .;Harry;Hermione;0.133333333333;5085;125
 Come on , I ca n't breathe . ;Harry;Hermione;0.0;5086;125
 Snape ' s ,  said Harry .;Harry;Hermione;0.0;5088;125
 What do we have to do ? ;Harry;Hermione;0.0;5089;125
 Look !  Hermione seized a roll of paper lying next to the bottles .;Hermione;Harry;0.0;5094;125
 Brilliant ,  said Hermione .;Hermione;Stone,Harry;0.9;5115;126
 This is n't magic - it 's logic - a puzzle . A lot of the greatest wizards have n't got an ounce of logic , they 'd be stuck in here forever . ;Hermione;Hermione,Stone;0.375;5116;126
 But so will we , wo n't we ? ;Harry;Hermione,Harry;0.0;5117;126
 Of course not ,  said Hermione .;Hermione;Stone,Harry;0.0;5118;126
 Everything we need is here on this paper . Seven bottles : three are poison  ,  two are wine  ,  one will get us safely through the black fire , and one will get us back through the purple . ;Harry;Hermione,Stone;0.111111111111;5119;126
 But how do we know which to drink ? ;Hermione;Hermione,Harry;0.0;5120;126
 Give me a minute . ;Hermione;Stone,Harry;0.0;5121;126
 Got it ,  she said .;Hermione;Hermione,Stone;0.0;5125;126
 The smallest bottle will get us through the black;Hermione;Stone,Harry;0.0;5128;126
 There 's only enough there for one of us ,  he said .;Harry;Hermione,Stone;0.0;5130;126
 That 's hardly one swallow . ;Harry;Stone,Harry;-0.291666666667;5131;126
 Which one will get you back through the purple flames ? ;Harry;Hermione,Harry;0.0;5133;126
 You drink that ,  said Harry .;Harry;Hermione,Stone;0.0;5135;126
 No , listen , get back and get Ron . Grab brooms from the flying-key room , they 'll get you out of the trapdoor and past Fluffy - go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to Dumbledore , we need him . I might be able to hold Snape off for a while , but I 'm no match for him , really . ;Harry;Hedwig,Ron,Snape;0.75;5136;126
 But Harry - what if You-Know-Who 's with him ? ;Hermione;You-Know-Who;0.0;5137;126
 Well - I was lucky once , was n't I ?  said Harry , pointing at his scar .;Harry;Hermione,Stone;0.333333333333;5138;126
 I might get lucky again . ;Harry;Hermione,Harry;0.333333333333;5139;126
 Hermione ! ;Harry;Stone,Harry;0.0;5141;126
 Harry - you 're a great wizard , you know . ;Hermione;Hermione,Harry;0.8;5142;126
 I 'm not as good as you ,  said Harry , very embarrassed , as she let go of him .;Harry;Hermione,Stone;0.45;5143;126
 Me !  said Hermione .;Hermione;Stone,Harry;0.0;5144;126
 Books ! And cleverness ! There are more important things - friendship and bravery and - oh Harry - be careful ! ;Hermione;Hermione,Harry;0.258333333333;5145;126
 You drink first ,  said Harry .;Harry;Hermione,Stone;0.25;5146;126
 You are sure which is which , are n't you ? ;Harry;Hermione,Harry;0.5;5147;126
 Positive ,  said Hermione .;Hermione;Stone,Harry;0.227272727273;5148;126
 It 's not poison ?  said Harry anxiously .;Harry;Hermione,Stone;-0.25;5150;126
 No - but it 's like ice . ;Hermione;Stone,Harry;0.0;5151;126
 Quick , go , before it wears off . ;Harry;Hermione,Stone;0.333333333333;5152;126
 Good luck - take care . ;Harry;Hermione,Harry;0.7;5153;126
 GO ! ;Harry;Stone,Harry;0.0;5154;126
 Here I come ,  he said , and he drained the little bottle in one gulp .;Harry;Hermione,Stone;-0.1875;5158;126
 You !  gasped Harry .;Harry;Quirrell;0.0;5169;127
 Me ,  he said calmly .;Quirrell;Quirrell;0.3;5172;127
 I wondered whether I 'd be meeting you here , Potter . ;Quirrell;Quirrell;0.0;5173;127
 But I thought - Snape - ;Harry;Quirrell;0.0;5174;127
 Severus ?  Quirrell laughed , and it was n't his usual quivering treble , either , but cold and sharp .;Quirrell;Harry;-0.06875;5175;127
 Yes , Severus does seem the type , does n't he ? So useful to have him swooping around like an overgrown bat . Next to him , who would suspect p-p-poor , st-stuttering P-Professor Quirrell ? ;Quirrell;Severus;0.15;5176;127
 But Snape tried to kill me ! ;Harry;Snape;0.0;5179;127
 No , no , no . I tried to kill you . Your friend Miss Granger accidentally knocked me over as she rushed to set fire to Snape at that Quidditch match . She broke my eye contact with you . Another few seconds and I 'd have got you off that broom . I 'd have managed it before then if Snape had n't been muttering a countercurse , trying to save you . ;Quirrell;Hermione,Snape;-0.2;5180;127
 Snape was trying to save me ? ;Harry;Snape;0.0;5181;127
 Of course ,  said Quirrell coolly .;Quirrell;Harry;0.35;5182;127
 Why do you think he wanted to referee your next match ? He was trying to make sure I did n't do it again . Funny , really...he need n't have bothered . I could n't do anything with Dumbledore watching . All the other teachers thought Snape was trying to stop Gryffindor from winning , he did make himself unpopular...and what a waste of time , when after all that , I 'm going to kill you tonight . ;Quirrell;Dumbledore,Snape;0.154166666667;5183;127
 You 're too nosy to live , Potter . Scurrying around the school on Halloween like that , for all I knew you 'd seen me coming to look at what was guarding the Stone . ;Quirrell;Stone;0.136363636364;5186;127
 You let the troll in ? ;Harry;Quirrell;0.0;5187;127
 Certainly . I have a special gift with trolls - you must have seen what I did to the one in the chamber back there ? Unfortunately , while everyone else was running around looking for it , Snape , who already suspected me , went straight to the third floor to head me off - and not only did my troll fail to beat you to death , that three-headed dog did n't even manage to bite Snape 's leg off properly .;Quirrell;Snape;-0.0253968253968;5188;127
" Now , wait quietly , Potter . I need to examine this interesting mirror . """;Quirrell;Quirrell;0.25;5189;127
 This mirror is the key to finding the Stone ,  Quirrell murmured , tapping his way around the frame .;Quirrell;Stone;0.0;5192;127
 Trust Dumbledore to come up with something like this...but he 's in London...I 'll be far away by the time he gets back ... ;Quirrell;Dumbledore,London;0.05;5193;127
 I saw you and Snape in the forest -  he blurted out .;Harry;Snape;0.0;5195;127
 Yes ,  said Quirrell idly , walking around the mirror to look at the back .;Quirrell;Harry;0.0;5196;127
 He was on to me by that time , trying to find out how far I 'd got . He suspected me all along . Tried to frighten me - as though he could , when I had Lord Voldemort on my side ... ;Quirrell;Voldemort;0.1;5197;127
 I see the Stone...I 'm presenting it to my master...but where is it ? ;Quirrell;Stone;0.0;5199;127
 But Snape always seemed to hate me so much . ;Harry;Snape;-0.3;5202;127
" Oh , he does ,  said Quirrell casually , "" heavens , yes . He was at Hogwarts with your father , did n't you know ? They loathed each other . But he never wanted you dead . """;Quirrell;Harry;-0.275;5203;127
 But I heard you a few days ago , sobbing - I thought Snape was threatening you ... ;Harry;Snape;-0.2;5204;127
" Sometimes ,  he said , "" I find it hard to follow my master 's instructions - he is a great wizard and I am weak - """;Quirrell;Quirrell;0.0444444444444;5206;127
 You mean he was there in the classroom with you ?  Harry gasped .;Harry;Quirrell;-0.3125;5207;127
 He is with me wherever I go ,  said Quirrell quietly .;Quirrell;Harry;0.0;5208;127
 I met him when I traveled around the world . A foolish young man I was then , full of ridiculous ideas about good and evil . Lord Voldemort showed me how wrong I was . There is no good and evil , there is only power , and those too weak to seek it...Since then , I have served him faithfully , although I have let him down many times . He has had to be very hard on me .  Quirrell shivered suddenly .;Quirrell;Voldemort;-0.174503968254;5209;127
 He does not forgive mistakes easily . When I failed to steal the stone from Gringotts , he was most displeased . He punished me...decided he would have to keep a closer watch on me ... ;Quirrell;Quirrell;0.144444444444;5210;127
 I do n't understand...is the Stone inside the mirror ? Should I break it ? ;Quirrell;Stone;0.0;5215;127
 What does this mirror do ? How does it work ? Help me , Master ! ;Quirrell;Quirrell;0.0;5223;127
 Use the boy...Use the boy ... ;Voldemort;Harry;0.0;5225;127
 Yes - Potter - come here . ;Quirrell;Quirrell;0.0;5227;127
 Come here ,  Quirrell repeated .;Quirrell;Quirrell;0.0;5230;127
 Look in the mirror and tell me what you see . ;Quirrell;Quirrell;0.0;5231;127
 Well ?  said Quirrell impatiently .;Quirrell;Harry;-0.2;5243;128
 What do you see ? ;Quirrell;Harry;0.0;5244;128
 I see myself shaking hands with Dumbledore ,  he invented .;Harry;Quirrell;0.0;5246;128
 I - I 've won the house cup for Gryffindor . ;Harry;Harry;0.0;5247;128
 Get out of the way ,  he said .;Quirrell;Quirrell;0.0;5249;128
 He lies...He lies ... ;Voldemort;Harry;0.0;5253;128
 Potter , come back here !  Quirrell shouted .;Quirrell;Harry;0.0;5254;128
 Tell me the truth ! What did you just see ? ;Quirrell;Harry;0.0;5255;128
 Let me speak to him...face-to-face ... ;Voldemort;Harry;0.0;5257;128
 Master , you are not strong enough ! ;Quirrell;Harry;-0.108333333333;5258;128
 I have strength enough...for this ... ;Voldemort;Quirrell;0.0;5259;128
 Harry Potter ...  it whispered .;Voldemort;Quirrell,Voldemort;0.0;5270;129
 See what I have become ?  the face said .;Voldemort;Harry,Voldemort;0.0;5272;129
 Mere shadow and vapor....I have form only when I can share another 's body...but there have always been those willing to let me into their hearts and minds...Unicorn blood has strengthened me , these past weeks...you saw faithful Quirrell drinking it for me in the forest...and once I have the Elixir of Life , I will be able to create a body of my own....Now...why do n't you give me that Stone in your pocket ? ;Voldemort;Quirrell;0.0;5273;129
 Do n't be a fool ,  snarled the face .;Voldemort;Harry,Voldemort;0.0;5277;129
 Better save your own life and join me...or you 'll meet the same end as your parents...They died begging me for mercy ... ;Voldemort;Hufflepuff;0.366666666667;5278;129
 LIAR !  Harry shouted suddenly .;Harry;Quirrell,Voldemort;0.0;5279;129
 How touching ...  it hissed .;Voldemort;Harry,Voldemort;0.5;5282;129
 I always value bravery....Yes , boy , your parents were brave...I killed your father first  ,  and he put up a courageous fight...but your mother need n't have died...she was trying to protect you...Now give me the Stone , unless you want her to have died in vain . ;Voldemort;Stone;0.25;5283;129
 NEVER ! ;Harry;Harry,Voldemort;0.0;5284;129
"Harry sprang toward the flame door , but Voldemort screamed "" SEIZE HIM ! "" and the next second , Harry felt Quirrell 's hand close on his wrist .";Voldemort;Quirrell,Voldemort;0.0;5285;129
 Seize him ! SEIZE HIM !  shrieked Voldemort again , and Quirrell lunged , knocking Harry clean off his feet landing on top of him , both hands around Harry 's neck - Harry 's scar was almost blinding him with pain , yet he could see Quirrell howling in agony .;Voldemort;Harry,Voldemort;0.433333333333;5288;129
 Master , I cannot hold him - my hands - my hands ! ;Quirrell;Quirrell,Voldemort;0.0;5289;129
 Then kill him , fool , and be done !  screeched Voldemort .;Voldemort;Harry,Quirrell;0.0;5291;129
 AAAARGH ! ;Quirrell;Quirrell,Voldemort;0.0;5293;129
 Good afternoon , Harry ,  said Dumbledore .;Dumbledore;Harry;0.7;5309;130
"Then he remembered : "" Sir ! The Stone ! It was Quirrell ! He 's got the Stone ! Sir , quick - """;Harry;Quirrell;0.333333333333;5311;130
 Calm yourself , dear boy , you are a little behind the times ,  said Dumbledore .;Dumbledore;Harry;-0.0958333333333;5312;130
 Quirrell does not have the Stone . ;Dumbledore;Quirrell;0.0;5313;130
 Then who does ? Sir , I - ;Harry;Harry;0.0;5314;130
 Harry , please relax , or Madam Pomfrey will have me thrown out . ;Dumbledore;Pomfrey;0.0;5315;130
 Tokens from your friends and admirers ,  said Dumbledore , beaming .;Dumbledore;Harry;0.0;5319;130
 What happened down in the dungeons between you and Professor Quirrell is a complete secret , so , naturally , the whole school knows . I believe your friends Misters Fred and George Weasley were responsible for trying to send you a toilet seat . No doubt they thought it would amuse you . Madam Pomfrey , however , felt it might not be very hygienic , and confiscated it . ;Dumbledore;Quirrell,Weasley;0.0263888888889;5320;130
 How long have I been in here ? ;Harry;Harry;-0.05;5321;130
 Three days . Mr. Ronald Weasley and Miss Granger will be most relieved you have come round , they have been extremely worried . ;Dumbledore;Hermione;0.0583333333333;5322;130
 But sir , the Stone - ;Harry;Harry;0.0;5323;130
 I see you are not to be distracted . Very well , the Stone . Professor Quirrell did not manage to take it from you . I arrived in time to prevent that , although you were doing very well on your own , I must say . ;Dumbledore;Quirrell;0.333333333333;5324;130
 You got there ? You got Hermione 's owl ? ;Harry;Hermione;0.0;5325;130
 We must have crossed in midair . No sooner had I reached London than it became clear to me that the place I should be was the one I had just left . I arrived just in time to pull Quirrell off you . ;Dumbledore;London,Quirrell;0.05;5326;130
 It was you . ;Harry;Harry;0.0;5327;130
 I feared I might be too late . ;Dumbledore;Harry;-0.3;5328;130
 You nearly were , I could n't have kept him off the Stone much longer â€“ ;Harry;Harry;0.15;5329;130
 Not the Stone , boy , you - the effort involved nearly killed you . For one terrible moment there , I was afraid it had . As for the Stone , it has been destroyed . ;Dumbledore;Harry;-0.5;5330;130
 Destroyed ?  said Harry blankly .;Harry;Dumbledore;0.0;5331;130
 But your friend - Nicolas Flamel - ;Harry;Harry;0.0;5332;130
 Oh , you know about Nicolas ?  said Dumbledore , sounding quite delighted .;Dumbledore;Harry;0.7;5333;130
 You did do the thing properly , did n't you ? Well , Nicolas and I have had a little chat , and agreed it 's all for the best . ;Dumbledore;Nicolas;0.270833333333;5334;130
 But that means he and his wife will die , wo n't they ? ;Harry;Harry;0.0;5335;130
 They have enough Elixir stored to set their affairs in order and then , yes , they will die . ;Dumbledore;Dumbledore;0.0;5336;130
 To one as young as you , I 'm sure it seems incredible , but to Nicolas and Perenelle , it really is like going to bed after a very , very long day . After all , to the well-organized mind , death is but the next great adventure . You know , the Stone was really not such a wonderful thing . As much money and life as you could want ! The two things most human beings would choose above all - the trouble is , humans do have a knack of choosing precisely those things that are worst for them . ;Dumbledore;Stone;0.2115625;5338;130
 Sir ?  said Harry .;Harry;Dumbledore;0.0;5341;130
 I 've been thinking...sir - even if the Stone 's gone , Vol - , I mean , You-Know-Who - ;Harry;Harry;-0.3125;5342;130
 Call him Voldemort , Harry . Always use the proper name for things . Fear of a name increases fear of the thing itself . ;Dumbledore;Voldemort;0.0;5343;130
 Yes , sir . Well , Voldemort 's going to try other ways of coming back , is n't he ? I mean , he has n't gone , has he ? ;Harry;Harry;-0.145833333333;5344;130
 No , Harry , he has not . He is still out there somewhere , perhaps looking for another body to share...not being truly alive , he cannot be killed . He left Quirrell to die  ,  he shows just as little mercy to his followers as his enemies . Nevertheless , Harry , while you may only have delayed his return to power , it will merely take someone else who is prepared to fight what seems a losing battle next time - and if he is delayed again , and again , why , he may never return to power . ;Dumbledore;Quirrell;-0.0979166666667;5345;130
"Then he said , "" Sir , there are some other things I 'd like to know , if you can tell me...things I want to know the truth about ... """;Harry;Harry;-0.125;5347;130
 The truth .  Dumbledore sighed .;Dumbledore;Harry;0.0;5348;130
 It is a beautiful and terrible thing , and should therefore be treated with great caution . However , I shall answer your questions unless I have a very good reason not to , in which case I beg you 'll forgive me . I shall not , of course , lie . ;Dumbledore;Harry;0.39;5349;130
 Well...Voldemort said that he only killed my mother because she tried to stop him from killing me . But why would he want to kill me in the first place ? ;Harry;Well...Voldemort;0.125;5350;130
 Alas , the first thing you ask me , I cannot tell you . Not today . Not now . You will know , one day...put it from your mind for now , Harry . When you are older...I know you hate to hear this...when you are ready , you will know . ;Dumbledore;Harry;-0.1875;5352;130
 But why could n't Quirrell touch me ? ;Harry;Dumbledore;0.0;5354;130
 Your mother died to save you . If there is one thing Voldemort cannot understand , it is love . He did n't realize that love as powerful as your mother 's for you leaves its own mark . Not a scar , no visible sign...to have been loved so deeply , even though the person who loved us is gone , will give us some protection forever . It is in your very skin . Quirrell , full of hatred , greed , and ambition , sharing his soul with Voldemort , could not touch you for this reason . It was agony to touch a person marked by something so good . ;Dumbledore;Voldemort;0.422727272727;5355;130
"When he had found his voice again , Harry said , "" And the invisibility cloak - do you know who sent it to me ? """;Harry;Dumbledore;0.0;5357;130
 Ah - your father happened to leave it in my possession , and I thought you might like it .  Dumbledore 's eyes twinkled .;Dumbledore;Harry;0.0;5358;130
 Useful things...your father used it mainly for sneaking off to the kitchens to steal food when he was here . ;Dumbledore;Harry;0.233333333333;5359;130
 And there 's something else ... ;Harry;Harry;0.0;5360;130
 Fire away . ;Dumbledore;Harry;0.0;5361;130
 Quirrell said Snape - ;Harry;Quirrell;0.0;5362;130
 Professor Snape , Harry . ;Dumbledore;Harry;0.0;5363;130
 Yes , him - Quirrell said he hates me because he hated my father . Is that true ? ;Harry;Quirrell;-0.275;5364;130
 Well , they did rather detest each other . Not unlike yourself and Mr. Malfoy . And then , your father did something Snape could never forgive . ;Dumbledore;Harry;-0.125;5365;130
 What ? ;Harry;Harry;0.0;5366;130
 He saved his life . ;Dumbledore;Harry;0.0;5367;130
 What ? ;Harry;Harry;0.0;5368;130
 Yes ...  said Dumbledore dreamily .;Dumbledore;Harry;0.0;5369;130
 Funny , the way people 's minds work , is n't it ? Professor Snape could n't bear being in your father 's debt...I do believe he worked so hard to protect you this year because he felt that would make him and your father even . Then he could go back to hating your father 's memory in peace ... ;Dumbledore;Snape;-0.0138888888889;5370;130
 And sir , there 's one more thing ... ;Harry;Dumbledore;0.5;5372;130
 Just the one ? ;Dumbledore;Harry;0.0;5373;130
 How did I get the Stone out of the mirror ? ;Harry;Stone;0.0;5374;130
 Ah , now , I 'm glad you asked me that . It was one of my more brilliant ideas , and between you and me , that 's saying something . You see , only one who wanted to find the Stone - find it , but not use it - would be able to get it , otherwise they 'd just see themselves making gold or drinking Elixir of Life . My brain surprises even me sometimes...Now , enough questions . I suggest you make a start on these sweets . Ah ! Bettie Bott 's Every Flavor Beans ! I was unfortunate enough in my youth to come across a vomit flavored one , and since then I 'm afraid I 've rather lost my liking for them - but I think I 'll be safe with a nice toffee , do n't you ? ;Dumbledore;Stone,Elixir;0.218181818182;5375;130
"Then he choked and said , "" Alas ! Ear wax ! """;Dumbledore;Harry;-0.625;5377;130
 Just five minutes ,  Harry pleaded .;Harry;Ron,Hermione,Pomfrey;0.0;5380;131
 Absolutely not . ;Pomfrey;Harry,Hermione,Pomfrey;-0.1;5381;131
 You let Professor Dumbledore in ... ;Harry;Dumbledore;0.0;5382;131
 Well , of course , that was the headmaster , quite different . You need rest . ;Pomfrey;Harry,Hermione,Pomfrey;0.0;5383;131
 I am resting , look , lying down and everything . Oh , go on , Madam Pomfrey ... ;Harry;Ron,Hermione,Pomfrey;-0.155555555556;5384;131
 Oh , very well ,  she said .;Pomfrey;Harry,Ron,Pomfrey;0.2;5385;131
 But five minutes only . ;Pomfrey;Harry,Hermione,Pomfrey;0.0;5386;131
 Harry ! ;Ron;Ron,Hermione,Pomfrey;0.0;5388;131
 Oh , Harry , we were sure you were going to - Dumbledore was so worried - ;Hermione;Dumbledore;0.5;5390;131
 The whole school 's talking about it ,  said Ron .;Ron;Harry,Hermione,Pomfrey;0.2;5391;131
 What really happened ? ;Ron;Ron,Hermione,Pomfrey;0.2;5392;131
 So the Stone 's gone ?  said Ron finally .;Ron;Harry,Hermione,Pomfrey;0.0;5396;131
 Flamel 's just going to die ? ;Ron;Ron,Hermione,Pomfrey;0.0;5397;131
 That 's what I said , but Dumbledore thinks that - what was it ? - ' to the well-organized mind , death is but the next great adventure . ' ;Harry;Dumbledore;0.4;5398;131
 I always said he was off his rocker ,  said Ron , looking quite impressed at how crazy his hero was .;Ron;Harry,Hermione,Pomfrey;0.2;5399;131
 So what happened to you two ?  said Harry .;Harry;Ron,Hermione,Pomfrey;0.0;5400;131
 Well , I got back all right ,  said Hermione .;Hermione;Harry,Ron,Pomfrey;0.142857142857;5401;131
 I brought Ron round - that took a while - and we were dashing up to the owlery to contact Dumbledore when we met him in the entrance hall - he already knew - he just said , ' Harry 's gone after him , has n't he ? ' and hurtled off to the third floor . ;Hermione;Ron;-0.1;5402;131
 D'you think he meant you to do it ?  said Ron .;Ron;Harry,Hermione,Pomfrey;0.0;5403;131
 Sending you your father 's cloak and everything ? ;Ron;Ron,Hermione,Pomfrey;0.0;5404;131
" Well ,  Hermione exploded , "" if he did - I mean to say that 's terrible - you could have been killed . """;Hermione;Harry,Ron,Pomfrey;-0.65625;5405;131
 No , it is n't ,  said Harry thoughtfully .;Harry;Ron,Hermione,Pomfrey;0.4;5406;131
 He 's a funny man , Dumbledore . I think he sort of wanted to give me a chance . I think he knows more or less everything that goes on here , you know . I reckon he had a pretty good idea we were going to try , and instead of stopping us , he just taught us enough to help . I do n't think it was an accident he let me find out how the mirror worked . It 's almost like he thought I had the right to face Voldemort if I could ... ;Harry;Voldemort;0.259863945578;5407;131
 Yeah , Dumbledore 's off his rocker , all right ,  said Ron proudly .;Ron;Harry,Hermione,Pomfrey;0.542857142857;5408;131
 Listen , you 've got to be up for the end-of-year feast tomorrow . The points are all in and Slytherin won , of course - you missed the last Quidditch match , we were steamrollered by Ravenclaw without you - but the food 'll be good . ;Ron;Slytherin;0.35;5409;131
 You 've had nearly fifteen minutes , now OUT  she said firmly .;Pomfrey;Harry,Ron,Hermione;-0.05;5411;131
"I want to go to the feast , "" he told Madam Pomfrey as she straightened his many candy boxes . I can , ca n't I ? """;Harry;Pomfrey;0.5;5414;132
 Professor Dumbledore says you are to be allowed to go ,  she said stiffly , as though in her opinion Professor Dumbledore did n't realize how risky feasts could be .;Pomfrey;Dumbledore;-0.214285714286;5415;132
 And you have another visitor . ;Pomfrey;Dumbledore,Harry;0.0;5416;132
 Oh , good ,  said Harry .;Harry;Dumbledore,Hagrid;0.7;5417;132
 Who is it ? ;Harry;Dumbledore,Harry;0.0;5418;132
 It 's - all - my - ruddy - fault !  he sobbed , his face in his hands .;Hagrid;Dumbledore,Hagrid;0.0;5422;132
"Hagrid ! "" said Harry , shocked to see Hagrid shaking with grief and remorse , great tears leaking down into his beard .";Harry;Dumbledore,Harry;-0.213888888889;5431;132
 Hagrid , he 'd have found out somehow , this is Voldemort we 're talking about , he 'd have found out even if you had n't told him . ;Harry;Voldemort;0.0;5432;132
 Yeh could 've died !  sobbed Hagrid .;Hagrid;Yeh;0.0;5433;132
